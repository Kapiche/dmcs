ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Conservationists say the Queensland Government is putting itself under pressure to approve a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.
The BG Group yesterday revealed it had signed a heads of agreement to supply Tokyo Gas with 1.2 million tonnes of LNG a year from a planned facility off Gladstone in central Queensland.
 The gas would come from southern Queensland, but the project still needs environmental approval.
Queensland Conservation Council executive director Toby Hutcheon says the Government faces a conflict of interest.
 Given that these announcements generally are by the company and the Government, we can only conclude that it's the Government who are creating the community expectation around these projects,  he said.
Mr Hutcheon says it is hard to stop the project going ahead considering the Government also made an announcement.
 Essentially these announcements are pre-empting an approvals process. The reality is they're creating an expectation of revenue, creating an expectation about jobs ... that makes it very, very difficult for the Government to then stop an approvals process,  he said.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"JAPAN has signalled its willingness to buy liquefied natural gas converted from coal seam methane, with Tokyo Gas the first Japanese utility to sign a deal to receive the unconventional gas.
In a further sign energy-hungry countries will increasingly accept the lean gas, Tokyo Gas has announced a deal with BG Group for 1.2 million tonnes a year of LNG for 20 years from 2015 in BG's Queensland Curtis project.
 The deal also continues the trend towards international LNG buyers acquiring equity positions in Australian projects.
Tokyo Gas will receive a 1.25 per cent interest in reserves and resources of certain tenements in Queensland's Surat Basin and a 2.5 per cent equity interest in BG's second processing train. No value was put on the transaction but some say it could worth between $13 billion and $26 billion.
The deal will be a headache for Woodside's Don Voelte, a critic of east-coast coal seam gas projects. He has said before that the coal seam gas industry in Australia will stall because traditional buyers of liquefied natural gas, such as Japan and Korea, will not accept the lower calorific value of LNG converted from coal seam methane.
The deal also trumps BG rival Santos, which UBS last week said had narrowed the list of potential customers from its neighbouring Curtis Island project to Tokyo Electric Power, Tokyo Gas and Korea Gas.
BG said the deal would be a binding agreement by the end of the year.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,2,"Residents want honest answers
Tara residents are up in arms and are voicing their concerns about the â€œslipshod mannerâ€? in which they believe coal seam gas extraction by QGC is being performed within their region.
 The concerns are many and varied with health and noise issues a high priority.
Tara resident Scott Collins said they had proof gas well heads located on residential properties were leaking toxic gases into the estates.
â€œWe have proof these wells are leaking methane and other toxic gases; 40 wells have been confirmed leaking,â€? he said.
He said QGC had ignored their health and safety concerns but the State Government had acted on their complaints.
Natural Resources minister Stephen Robertson said the Chief Inspector of the Petroleum and Gas Inspectorate had issued a compliance direction to QGC in relation to claims of gas leaks from pressurised wells operated by the company near Tara.
â€œThe direction requires QGC to identify, inspect and rectify any wells found to be leaking gas,â€? he said.
â€œThe company has also been directed to provide the department with regular progress reports on actions they have taken.â€?
Officers from the department are also inspecting a number of QGC gas well heads around the Tara region and samples will be taken for analysis.
Another Tara resident, who does not wish to be named, said she was one of many locals who were suffering health problems due to the leaks.
Problems included eye and skin irritations, constant headaches and acute diarrhoea.
â€œMany other people, myself included, are experiencing health problems, which started over a year ago and these problems are escalating,â€? she said.
Mr Collins has also raised concerns surrounding expected noise levels that residents may experience when compressors are brought onto residential land.
He said QGC has suggested building acoustic walls to tone down the noise.
â€œSomething else to look forward to is QGC plan on building acoustic walls around our homes to mitigate the noise.
â€œIf it wasnâ€™t so sad it would be funny.â€?
In response, QGC has acknowledged that activities around Tara had raised issues for some landholders on how the company managed dust, noise, water and environmental impacts.
A QGC spokesperson has said that while they continued to ensure their impact was acceptable, some landholders had particularly strong views about industry activity in general.
â€œTo date we have spoken to or met with more than 1000 stakeholders throughout the project area, including more than 160 local people and business owners in and around Tara, with the aim to ensuring that our impact is acceptable,â€? he said.
In relation to the leaking wells, QGC said it had every confidence at every level in its business in the safety of its facilities and its operating practice.
â€œWe are aware that some residents have provided information to the Chief Inspector Petroleum and Gas of Queensland Mines and Energy (the regulator), alleging that QGC is not operating within its licence.
â€œIn particular, several landholders north of Tara have alleged that 39 wells operated by QGC are leaking gas.
â€œQGC is in the process of demonstrating that the company is complying with the legislation under which it operates, and in particular, that QGC is taking all necessary and reasonable action to ensure that no person or property is exposed to an unacceptable risk as a result of QGCâ€™s operation.â€?
In relation to noise concerns, QGC has also confirmed it is looking at ways to minimise noise from gas field infrastructure.
Suggestions have included using electronic drive compressors at major field infrastructure such as central processing plants and field compressor stations.
Enclosures around engines and compressors and variable speed and low speed fans.
â€œThe placement of field infrastructure will also take account of locations that may be sensitive to noise such as homes and community assets like schools,â€? a spokesperson said.
â€œThese measures will help ensure the project operates with minimal disturbance to our neighbours.â€?
Overall QGC has said it has no reason to believe it is not operating according to good gas field practice and has a continuous well-inspection regime to ensure the integrity of its facilities.
â€œWe will immediately intervene in any wells found to be unsafe.â€?

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"AUSTRALIA'S fledging liquefied natural gas industry has signed a $20 billion contract with a large Japanese company following last week's deal with Chinese interests.
The BG Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Queensland Gas, yesterday announced that it had struck a deal with Tokyo Gas to supply 1.2 million tonnes of LNG each year for 20 years.
 Queensland Premier Anna Bligh made the announcement jointly with the BG Group yesterday, but for all the euphoria about the coming LNG industry, no company has yet committed to definitely building a processing plant in the industrial Queensland central coast city of Gladstone to turn into liquid the gas taken from coal seams in western Queensland.
Of the four major projects currently planned, both the BG Group and Santos are due to make firm decisions later this year about whether or not they will proceed with their projects. But both companies have also privately indicated that their decision is heavily dependent on the Queensland government giving them some certainty.
If the companies this year decide to go ahead, they will first produce LNG in 2014.
The value of yesterday's announcement is about one-third of that announced last week between the BG Group and the China National Offshore Oil Corp.
But while Japan is the world's largest consumer of LNG, it is the first time a Japanese company has struck a deal to take LNG processed from coal-seam methane.
For the financially stretched Queensland government, the development of the LNG industry is a priority, and the government claims it can bring up to 18,000 jobs, investment of $40 billion, an increase of $3bn in gross state product, and $850 million in royalties alone each year.
But problems remain in the disposal of waste water produced through the process, while some farmers are opposed to the industry because they fear losing their valuable farmland for an industry that is forecast to last only 20 years.
Ms Bligh was upbeat about the announcement, claiming that it could support up to 8500 jobs on the western Darling Downs and in Gladstone.
``This is yet another historic day for Queensland because it means we will not only supply the massive emerging LNG market in China but we also have a 20-year commitment to supply the world's largest LNG market in Japan,'' she said.
``What we are witnessing is the birth of an industry that will secure the prosperity of Queensland for decades to come.''
The BG Group also has contracts with Singaporean and Chilean companies and now has firm orders for supply of 9.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas each year, and yesterday's announcement means it is considering adding further capacity to its Australian operations.
"
CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,2,"The Australian Energy Regulator has rejected ActewAGL's proposal to spend $134million on upgrading its gas link to the Eastern Gas Pipeline. The regulator also rejected a second ActewAGL option to spend $42million to boost storage from its link to the Moomba to Sydney Pipeline. Had either project gone ahead ACT gas consumers would be paying much more than the 7per cent increase which the regulator has approved. On average, retail customers will pay about 52c a week more for gas from July 1. Every five years ActewAGL lodges an access arrangement with the regulator. The latest one sought to address four serious failures of upstream gas supply coinciding with cold temperatures in the previous access period. But from the time ActewAGL lodged the access arrangement in June last year to now, coal seam gas developments in Queensland and pipeline upgrades saved the utility from doing these projects. In its decision on ActewAGL's
 proposals, the regulator said the proposed expenditure on a compressor on the MSP was not prudent or good industry practice. ActewAGL general manager networks division Michael Charlton said when assessing the first project, the Hoskinstown-Fyshwick loop upgrade (which links to the Eastern Gas Pipeline), the regulator couldn't decide whether a supply problem was one for the distribution network or for the pipeline operator. A spokesman for the regulator said the risk of low volumes of gas on one morning every few years did not warrant $134million expenditure. Mr Charlton said when preparing a revised proposal, ActewAGL became aware of work to increase the MSP's capacity and reliability and put forward the compressor plan for the lateral line, from Dalton to Watson. The aim was to compress gas to meet peak winter demand. The Australian Pipeline Group would build the compression station at Dalton, funded by ActewAGL. After upgrades to the MSP and coal seam gas pipelines in south- east Queensland being connected
to the MSP, this project was also deemed unnecessary by the regulator.Canberra now has three sources of gas supply, the Eastern Gas Pipeline, MSP and south-east Queensland supply. Mr Charlton said capacity in the lateral line from Dalton was still restricted on capacity from MSP. ''Even though there is plenty of gas there, we can only bring in so much each day through that [lateral] pipeline.'' That would only be a problem if supply from the Eastern Gas Pipeline failed. He expected the utility to have enough supply for the next five years. The regulator has approved $84million in infrastructure investment and over the next five years the gas network will expand into new developments in the Molonglo Valley and north Weston and Googong. Customers in some existing areas such as Swinger Hill will have access to natural gas for the first time. Other network capacity expansion will be undertaken in Tuggeranong, Queanbeyan, Red Hill and Griffith.
"
CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,2,"CANBERRA'S overall air quality is very good, however, during the winter months smoke emissions from domestic wood heaters results in elevated particulate levels, particularly in the Tuggeranong Valley. The ACT Government has a number of ongoing programs to address wood smoke, which are implemented by the Department of the Environment, Climate Change, Energy and Water. These include the Wood Heater Replacement Program, ongoing public education related to correct wood heater operation and the
'Don't Burn Tonight' campaign. The department is currently running the 2010 Wood Heater Replacement Program. The program aims to reduce winter air pollution from wood smoke by offering a financial incentive for replacing a wood heater with a cleaner mains-supplied natural gas heater.
 The department is conscious of the fact that not everyone can replace their wood heater, so they have a range of information on their website as to their correct use. An example is that you shouldn't let your fire
smoulder. A fire set on a low air setting causes excessive smoke pollution and wastes heat energy. On very cold and still nights wood heater users should also listen out for the 'Don't Burn Tonight' alerts. The program runs during June, July and August each year and aims to alleviate overnight air pollution by calling on Canberrans to use alternatives to wood heaters, if possible, on these nights.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"UK-based BG Group yesterday said it had reached an initial agreement to supply key Japanese buyer Tokyo Gas Co with 24 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas from its Queensland operations.
BG Group chief executive Frank Chapman said Tokyo Gas would become one of the ``important foundation customers'' for the Queensland Curtis LNG facility that BG proposes to build near Gladstone to process coal seam gas from the Surat Basin to feed world LNG markets.
 It comes after BG Group last week said it had sealed an LNG supply deal with China National Offshore Oil Corp that involves 72 million tonnes of LNG to be supplied over
20 years.
Long-term values hinge on variable LNG market prices but the CNOOC deal was estimated to be worth between $50 billion and $80 billion.
BG Group didn't put an indicative value on the Tokyo Gas supply agreement but Premier Anna Bligh, who held a press conference to announce the BG-Tokyo Gas deal, said it could be worth more than $20 billion and support up to 8500 jobs in Queensland. BG Group said the overall agreement it had reached with Tokyo Gas, Japan's largest city gas supplier, set out the basis upon which the two companies would now negotiate to agree final terms.
The deal includes Tokyo Gas's purchase of 1.2 million tonnes a year of LNG for 20 years from 2015 from the Queensland Curtis LNG facility and from BG's global LNG operations.
Continued P80
BG lands Japanese deal
From P75
BG Group said the companies aimed to complete negotiations by the end of 2010.
That is conditional on BG Group making a final investment decision, expected later this year, on the Curtis Island project. If it proceeds, it would produce first LNG by 2014.
Curtis Island, just north of Gladstone, is home to a national park and the site is yet to receive final state and federal government environmental approvals.
But Ms Bligh yesterday hailed the BG-Tokyo Gas agreement as ``yet another historic day for Queensland because it means we will not only supply the massive emerging LNG market in China, we also have a 20-year commitment to supply the world's largest LNG market, in Japan''.
BG Group's Mr Chapman (pictured) said the company would ``progress rapidly towards project sanction later this year''.
``The agreements extend further our long and fruitful relationship with Tokyo Gas, bringing a new source of natural gas to Japan,'' he said.
He said the two-train development planned for Curtis Island was firmly underpinned by BG's LNG agreements to deliver cargo from both QCLNG and from BG's global LNG portfolio to customers across the Pacific Basin.
Its other LNG deals include CNOOC, as well as a 21-year deal struck in 2007 with Chile's Quintero LNG and a deal in 2008 to supply to customers in Singapore for 20 years.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"One of the world's biggest buyers of liquefied natural gas will purchase up to $20 billion in LNG from BG Group's Queensland project in another huge boost for Australia's coal seam gas sector.
Japanese energy giant Tokyo Gas has agreed to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG a year from BG's Queensland Curtis project for 20 years, representing Japan's first committed purchase of LNG made from coal seam gas.
 While Japan now buys about 40Â per cent of the world's LNG, its companies previously had ignored LNG made from coal seam gas because of concerns about the composition of the product.
The agreement between BG and Tokyo comes just a week after BG finalised a record $65 billion binding LNG sales agreement with China National Offshore Oil Company.
The latest agreement increases the likelihood that BG can develop three trains, or processing lines, at its project instead of two.
While the Tokyo deal is a major credibility boost for the coal seam gas sector generally, it may set back plans by Adelaide-based Santos to secure another customer for its Gladstone LNG project.
Santos, which plans to develop the project through a joint venture with Malaysia's Petronas, is believed to have been in talks with Tokyo Gas over its own LNG sales agreement.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay last week identified Tokyo Gas as one of the three most likely candidates to buy LNG from Santos, along with Japan's Tepco and Korea's Kogas.
While Santos has secured a binding heads of agreement to sell up to 3 million tonnes a year of LNG to Petronas, the company is looking to secure another customer to underpin the development of a second train at its project.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"The world market will affect domestic prices, say industry experts
AUSTRALIA'S development of an export market for liquid natural gas is likely to put upward pressure on domestic gas prices, as the international market is considerably more lucrative than the domestic market.
 An LNG conference in Brisbane this week heard that the implied value of LNG bound for the domestic market -- the value after factors such as transport are taken into account -- was $6.75 a gigalitre, while long-term domestic prices were forecast to be $3.75 a gigalitre.
The reason for the difference in prices was that international gas prices were based on world oil prices, while domestic prices were based on getting a satisfactory rate of return on investment.
Grahame Baker, senior adviser with Resources and Land Management Services, said east-coast gas production was likely to break into two markets.
The first was an overseas market dominated by large international companies which tapped coal-seam methane gas for conversion to liquid natural gas for export. The second would be a domestic market serviced by smaller companies which also took some of the leftover from the large companies.
``So balancing the big players in overseas markets, there will be a number of smaller producers aiming at domestic markets, and they'll keep prices down,'' he said.
Currently coal-seam gas supplies about one-third of the east-coast market, but the industry is set to change dramatically, with up to four export-oriented projects in Queensland coming to fruition over the next few years.
These major projects hold 88 per cent of the current proven volume of coal-seam methane gas in Queensland.
Gas tapped from Queensland wells currently costs $3.50 to $4 a gigajoule and supplies Victoria, NSW and South Australia as well as Queensland.
In Western Australia, gas prices have risen to $7-$8 a gigajoule, and there are fears that prices in the east may rise when that market is exposed to international prices.
But Mr Baker said WA was a different market, and the main reason prices had risen was that domestic gas supplies had dried up.
In the east-coast market there would be a glut of gas for several years, keeping prices low, said independent energy industry analyst Peter Strachan.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"NSW could rival Queensland as a hub for coal seam gas
GAS
 WHILE the shape of the Queensland liquid natural gas industry based on coal seam methane gas should become clear in the next three months, analysts are already talking about an industry of a similar size in NSW.
Two of the four major projects proposed for Queensland are due to decide this quarter whether they will make a firm commitment to the project, while the other two will probably decide within a year if their projects are viable.
Both BG and Santos are due to decide by the middle of this year whether or not they will proceed with their major LNG export projects out of Gladstone, with the raw material coming from the Surat and Bowen basins of western Queensland.
But a Brisbane conference on coal seam methane gas this week heard that NSW probably has similar reserves of coal seam methane gas in the Gunnedah and Sydney Basin, and there is no reason why NSW should not become a similar industry to that of Queensland, with Newcastle assuming the same processing role as that planned for Queensland. In Queensland, BG's announcement this week of a further long-term sales contract with Tokyo Gas means it has firm contracts to supply 9.5 million tonnes of LNG for the next 20 years, while Santos has supply guaranteed through its joint venture partner in Malaysia's Petronas.
Past these two projects, Origin and Conoco-Phillips are likely to make a decision towards the end of this year, and the fourth, which looks as though it will be a mixture of Arrow Energy, Shell and
PetroChina, is more likely to make a firm decision on its project about the middle of next year.
Origin last week lodged its Environmental Impact Statement with the Queensland Government, and that is now open for public feedback.
But Shell is still negotiating its takeover of Arrow, although the Arrow board has recommended in favour of the takeover, there is still
Continued on Page 22
Continued from Page 21
some scepticism in the market about whether it will proceed.
But even a decision to go ahead with the takeover will still involve some delay, with a meeting to approve the takeover scheduled for August and the actual takeover not likely to be completed until September.
Shell has said it planned to be producing LNG for export by 2015, about a year after the others, so on that timetable it is reasonable to assume that, all other factors being equal, it will make a decision early next year. Under the current scenario there will be four major exporters, each with their own LNG plant at Gladstone on Curtis Island, on the other side of the harbour to where the current port is located.
But it is this scenario that has its sceptics. Put simply, building four plants side by side to do pretty well exactly the same thing is not good economics, and there may be room here for further rationalisations. But all this activity shows the Queensland industry is well advanced, while the other state with large volumes of coal -- NSW -- is still in its formative stages. But industry analyst Paul Balfe, who is a director at ACIL consultants, said that NSW coal deposits in the Gunnedah and Sydney basins were much the same age and with the same characteristics as the Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland.
He said that, although there had not been as much exploration in NSW as there had been in Queensland, it seemed highly likely that there were similar reserves of CSG in NSW.
``There's no doubt at all that there are very large reserves in NSW, but it's a question of having sufficient demand to tap those supplies,'' Mr Balfe said. ``In the long term, it would be possible to replicate what's happened in Queensland in NSW, using the Gladstone model with Newcastle as the port.''
The coal seam methane gas industry has been in existence in Australia since the 1970s and became more sizeable in the Bowen Basin in Queensland in the 1990s, but has really kicked on this century. The main reason for the industry's acceleration is greater environmental concern, as gas is considerably less greenhouse-intrusive than coal as an energy source. But Mr Balfe said the greatest encouragement to the industry would be the formation of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, as a carbon price would make coal production considerably less attractive.
``If there is a carbon price operating, then we could see a domestic demand of 1800 petajoules a year, but if there's not, it would be around 1200,'' he said.
There are several areas where domestic demand could be increased. One is in having power stations fired by gas instead of coal, and Origin will next month commission its gas-fired power station on the Darling Downs. Another is switching motor vehicles from petrol to compressed natural gas. Buses in Canberra, Perth and Adelaide already use it.
Fuel retailer BOC is also building a network of CNG stations and refineries to fuel long-distance trucks, with one in Chinchilla on the Darling Downs, in the middle of CSG country, being announced two weeks ago.
Production of gas and water for a coal seam methane well
1. When coal is formed, methane is trapped on the surface of the seam or in water or fractures within the underground coal bed.
The methane is held in place by the pressure of water in the seam.
2. Wells - often more than 100 per project - are drilled in the seam and water is pumped out.
3. As the pressure within the seam falls, the gas is released.
4. After drying and compression, the processed gas can then be used for domestic gas supplies or it can be piped to plants where it is converted into liquefied natural gas and shipped to export markets.
5. The water, usually held in ponds, is either pumped back into the seam or can be processed and made fit for certain domestic uses

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"Early investors are receiving up to 40 times their outlay
IN its steady but inexorable way, the coal-seam gas good news story keeps growing, with Arrow Energy the latest to deliver a whopping return to shareholders if they accept the Shell-PetroChina takeover offer.
 Investors who backed Arrow's August 2000 initial public offering at 20c a share will make 22.5 times their original outlay if they sell at the $4.70 offer price.
Including the value of the planned spin-off, Dart Energy, which will hold the overseas and residual assets, the return is at least 24 times. And it's not over, as the investors will have the chance to do it all again with Dart.
Twenty-four times your capital in 9 1/2 years is hot, but Arrow is not the hottest on the list of coal-gas winners.
It was only a year ago that British Gas bought Queensland Gas for $5.75 per share. In a striking coincidence Queensland Gas, like Arrow, listed in August 2000 at 20c per share. Queensland Gas gave its IPO supporters a return of 27.75 times their capital, and in a year less than it took Arrow.
Even Queensland Gas is not the hottest play. Pure Energy listed in July 2006 at 20c and was taken over by British Gas only two years and nine months later for $8.25 per share. That's a sizzling 40.25 times return on capital.
In this game, even the lesser players are stars. Sunshine Gas listed at 20c in May 2002 and was taken over by Queensland Gas for a choice of Queensland Gas shares or $1.65 plus shares. This happened just in time for British Gas to buy the Queensland Gas shares. Depending which scrip offer they took, Sunshine's IPO shareholders reaped either 17 times or 15.5 times their capital in seven years and five months.
And let's not leave out Origin Energy, which demerged from Boral and came on to the ASX in March 2000 at $1.20 per share. Ten years later, thanks largely to coal-seam gas, it is now at about $16.55. That may seem modest by comparison, yet it is a mighty 13.75 times return in 10 years.
It's no wonder investors have been running around for some time wondering which company will be the next big coal-seam gas takeover story.
It is wonderful to see an environmentally friendly energy source do so well. It is something Australia needs.
In this, so far, very happy story even the acquirers seem to be doing well. British Gas has announced it will sell huge amounts of coal-seam-derived LNG to China and Japan if its subsidiary, Queensland Gas, goes ahead with an LNG plant.
The good news has, at worst, only one small but sad irony -- it seems a shame to go from Queensland Gas to British Gas without an Australian Gas in between. But we're not surprised. The lack of a roll-up strategy by a local player is not untypical of the Australian resources sector. It has happened before.
Once again, the overseas big boys have the know-how, the cash and the confidence -- paying fantastic prices for gas that is still in the ground and still having enough left in their multi-billion-dollar wallets to risk billions more to turn the gas into LNG. Who in Australia could or would do that?
An Australian Gas would be nice, but local shareholders are still working out what to do with all their cash. If they give it a thought, they know it's easier to put some of their profit into British Gas or Shell shares and go along for a low-risk ride. At some point we need to think and act further up the value chain. A mighty, or even multinational, Australian Solar? Australian Geothermal? Australian Wind? An Australian Wave Energy? Why not? Those booms may be years or decades away, so we have time to save up while we think about it.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"CARRIER By Jessica Marszalek
BRISBANE, April 5 AAP - The Queensland government is under pressure to safeguard the Great Barrier Reef against shipping threats as it ramps up coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.
 The 230m Chinese coal ship Shen Neng 1 ran aground about 70km east of Great Keppel Island on Saturday, spilling two tonnes of oil into protected marine park waters.
The bulk carrier remains in danger of breaking apart and damaging the marine environment by releasing 950 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and its cargo of 65,000 tonnes of coal into the sea.
Environmentalists and politicians say the risk of such accidents will only increase as Queensland increases resources exports.
The Australian Greens say the crisis would not have happened if a pilot had been aboard to guide the ship on its journey up the coast. The Queensland opposition says a lack of radar coverage of ships in the area is also a problem.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said requiring local pilots on board ships in Great Barrier Reef waters and better tracking systems could help mitigate risks to the reef from shipping.
 We have a premier spruiking the wonders of building a whole new LNG industry (and) a three- or four-times expansion of the coal industry in Queensland,  Capricorn Conservation Council's vice president Ian Herbert said.
 The numbers of ships that are going to be plying these waters will greatly increase, increasing the likelihood of similar events in the future. 
The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for export ships to sail south on their way to the Pacific Ocean, instead of taking the northerly course up the Queensland coast.
Ms Bligh said she realised shipping traffic would increase, and maritime authorities had already been working on a risk analysis looking at issues such as mandatory pilots aboard cargo and freight vessels.
Environmental groups also say not enough is being done to understand the effects of a large-scale coal spill, especially considering the sharp rise in coal shipments.
 It's a wake-up call to all of us,  the WWF's Gilly Llewellyn said.
 It's time to have a strategic look at all aspects around the growth and development of the coal industry in Queensland and the environmental consequences that come along with that growth. 
Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott and Greens leader Bob Brown called on Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to personally take charge of the situation.

Amid ballooning gas supply and with possible falls in gas prices, a big supplier to utilities says investors could shy away from backing carbon capture and storage (CCS), which involves burying power station emissions underground.
 Philippe Paelinck, director of carbon dioxide product at Alstom, a global supplier to utilities, called the gas bubble the biggest threat to the development of carbon capture in the next five years.
 I think if you look at the main threat to CCS in the coming five years, it is really gas,  Mr Paelinck said last week in Sydney.
In the past two to three years, global gas reserves have surged after technological advances and increased demand made  unconventional  reserves commercially viable. Soaring demand has also increased the world's yearly supply of liquefied natural gas by 50 per cent in the past two years.
In Australia, this trend has manifested in the coal-seam gas boom, which has attracted tens of billions in investment dollars from the world's oil giants.
 All of a sudden gas becomes a lot more available at an affordable price,  he said.  If you have low gas prices, there will be a clear temptation â€” it's already there â€” to switch to power generation from gas. 
Alstom produces power generation equipment for both fossil fuel and renewable power stations. It is backing several CCS projects in Europe and America.
In Australia, which generates more than 80 per cent of its power from coal, gas is expected to meet a growing share of generation needs, with investment in gas plants expected to cost $15 billion in the next decade. Consecutive governments have talked up the potential of CCS as a solution to cutting carbon, but the technology requires hefty subsidies to be economic.
Mr Paelinck said making  clean coal  viable depended on significant investments in the developed world, as emerging nations such as China were not pouring enough funds into the technology:  If we don't develop CCS because of gas in the US and in Europe, we won't have any CCS in the rest of the world â€” that's the problem.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"WESTSIDE MELBOURNE, April 6 AAP - Coal seam gas explorer WestSide Corporation Ltd has requested a trading halt for its shares while it finalises arrangements or an equity-raising related to its acquisition of a stake in the Dawson coal seam gas fields.
 WestSide is concerned that while in the process of finalising commitments, some market participants may become aware of the details of the fundraising package,  Westside said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday.
  WestSide considers the size and composition of the funding package to be material to the company's affairs. 
The company expects to announce details of the funding package within 24 hours.
WestSide Corporation has struck a deal with Japanese giant Mitsui to exploit a reserve in Queensland's giant Bowen Basin.
WestSide will pay $26.8 million to take a 51 per cent stake in the joint-venture with Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd.
The two companies plan to buy the Dawson Seamgas fields in the Bowen Basin in central eastern Queensland from existing owners Anglo American and Mitsui Moura Investment Pty Ltd.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"Underground coal gasification: little brother to coal seam gas
STEPPING OUT OF THE SHADOW
UNDERGROUND COAL GASIFICATION
  THE PROCESS: Oxidants are injected into a
production well and over non-mined coal seams.
The combustion results in gas that is transported
up a second well where it can be used as a fuel, a
chemical feedstock or for power generation.
  THE RESULT: Provides 20 times the amount of
energy from one cubic metre of coal than coal
seam gas technology.
  USES: Include power, ammonia, diesel ingredient.
  AUSTRALIAâ€™S MAJOR PLAYERS: Linc Energy,
Cougar Energy and Carbon Energy, all with sites in
southern Queensland

 Rising energy demand has put underground coal gasification in play, writes Mathew Murphy.
STEPHEN Bartrop says underground coal gasification (UCG) can be considered as the often overlooked younger brother to coal seam gas.
The LimeStreet Capital resources fund manager says while coal seam gas has become one of the biggest stories in the resources sector in the past three years, versatile and highly efficient underground coal gasification is starting to emerge from its shadow.
 They do share similarities,  Bartrop says.  Those who have come across underground coal gasification often say, 'We have seen some pilot plants work; conceptually it looks good, but there are still some question marks hanging over its head until it is commercialised'.
 However, given that for one cubic metre of coal you get 20 times the amount of energy out of a coal seam through UCG than through coal seam gas technology, it really is just a matter of time before it comes into its own â€” which will have huge implications for Australia's vast coalfields. 
The coming of age for UCG has been lengthy. The technology was first developed in the 19th century and encouraged in Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. The process works by injecting oxidants down a production well and over non-mined coal seams. The combustion results in gas that is transported up a second well, where it can then be used as a fuel, a chemical feedstock or for power generation.
Cougar Energy managing director Len Walker, one of the pioneers of UCG in Australia, says rising energy demand has put the technology in play.
 When I founded Linc Energy in 1996, or even when I founded Cougar more than two years ago, there was very limited interest in UCG,  Dr Walker says.  There was also very little going on overseas at the time. Apart from Linc Energy, Carbon Energy and ourselves, which are the big three in the space, I have counted six or seven other listed companies that have recently popped up and which are all promoting UCG in different ways.
 I have never seen anything like it in the 30 years that I have been involved in UCG. The genie is out of the bottle and it is unlikely to be put back in the bottle again. 
Walker says an important difference between UCG and coal seam gas is that the latter is produced for conversion into liquefied natural gas and the export market, while the former is aimed at domestic supply.
 It would take far too much effort to convert underground coal gasification for export,  Walker says.  Everyone can see energy prices going up but if we can bring this to market, and clearly I am a firm believer in that eventuating, then we will be underpinning the price of gas in Australia. 
Last month Cougar announced ignition of its flagship Kingaroy project in south-east Queensland and the successful production of synthetic gas (or syngas).
The company will soon undertake a series of trials, underground and on the surface, that will be used for a pre-feasibility study and a subsequent bankable feasibility.
The composition and variability of the gas will determine the final design for Cougar's planned 400-megawatt power station, producing enough energy to power 400,000 homes for at least 30 years. Walker is hopeful of securing $300 million in combined debt and equity funding by early next year. The proceeds will fund its 200-megawatt stage 1 project to be completed by 2013.
Travel about 125 kilometres south-west of Kingaroy and you will find Linc's Chinchilla project, which has a slightly different take on UCG. It uses the process to convert coal to liquids, which it has been doing for about 10 years, and its goal is to produce 20,000 barrels a day â€” 10 per cent of Australia's current fuel consumption.
Linc chief executive Peter Bond says the company is looking at branching into power generation.
 What UCG is eventually used for is really driven by geography. So in Vietnam, for instance, power is in short supply so you wouldn't do anything else but power,  he says.
 We are hopeful of putting in a power station in South Australia, which is being pushed through at a rate of knots because South Australia is really short on power supply. That would be a 200 to 400-megawatt commitment, with construction to start by the end of next year. 
Neighbouring Linc's tenements in the Surat Basin is Carbon Energy. Having completed its pilot burn more than a year ago, Carbon Energy is targeting a five-megawatt plant, which will be operational by midyear and be the first of its kind in the world.
Andrew Dash, Carbon Energy's managing director, says at that stage the company may be ready to announce plans for a 20 to 25-megawatt power station, which would take 18 months to build.
 We are in discussions with potential partners now who will take power from the plant but also look to own the power station, and we would sell gas into that,  he says.  Hopefully those prospective partners will join us for the 20-megawatt plant but also the further 300-megawatt upgrade. 
Last week private equity fund Pacific Road Resources Fund said it would take a 10 per cent stake in the company by acquiring the interest from the CSIRO in an off-market trade. The company owns the intellectual property rights to the CSIRO's underground coal gasification technology. Pacific Road will become Carbon Energy's second-largest shareholder behind Incitec Pivot, which owns 11.3 per cent. Incitec's involvement indicates that Carbon Energy will also look to produce ammonia.
All three men believe UCG will be the next big thing. Just as unconventional gases such as coal seam methane and shale gas were once viewed as niche resources, they say, UCG will find its place.
A new generation of UCG players is emerging. From Regal Resources, which is testing Victoria's potential with a pilot plant near the You Yangs, to Clean Global Energy, which has plans to develop a commercial UCG project in Mongolia, the market is growing.
The market's appetite will be tested over the next 18 months to two years as many projects try to secure finance to make their visions a reality.
Don't be surprised at that time if underground coal gasification is spoken about with the same wonder that market commentators have expressed at the growth of the once unpopular coal seam gas industry, now the darling of the Australian resources industry.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"QUEENSLAND is building a ``ticking time bomb'' through the massive expansion of the liquefied natural gas industry with as much as 50,000 tonnes of salt to be dredged from beneath the ground, says the Queensland Murray-Darling Committee.
It also estimates a massive 120,000 megalitres of water a year, almost equivalent to the entire storage of the Bjelke-Petersen Dam west of Gympie, will be pulled to the surface when a potential 20,000 wells start pumping coal seam gas from deep reservoirs under the handful of projects now in the planning stages.
 ``That's got to have an effect on the other water sources,'' the Queensland Murray-Darling Committee's Jeff Penton said.
``The problem is that some of it sits right on top of the Great Artesian Basin and that is the lifeblood of many of Queensland's inland towns.''
The salt-laden water comes to the surface through the extraction of the gas and the plan is to separate it, desalinate it and either use it for agriculture or urban water or reinject it into the aquifers.
The Queensland Conservation Council has similar concerns, citing the massive amount of salt water produced by Queensland Gas developments alone.
``They say they are going to reuse it or find markets for it, but those markets don't exist,'' QCC's Toby Hutcheon said.
Mr Penton said his group was not opposed to the mining but was worried about its legacy, like the salt landfills. ``It's a ticking time bomb,'' he said.
One coal seam gas operation will potentially extract more than 100,000 cubic metres of salt a year, while another estimated it would produce up to 360,000 cubic metres of salt over five years.
Santos, which is partnering Petronas in its GLNG project, said it was in talks with potential buyers of the salt.
``Any remaining salt could be reinjected into deep coal seams which would safely contain the material indefinitely,'' it said. ``We already successfully re-inject brine into a deep aquifer under an existing environmental authority.''
But farmers claim that when combined with the thousands of wells, critical farming land and food production will be lost.
While the companies involved - Origin, Queensland Gas and Santos - claim the gas can be harvested safely they also accept the science on the Great Artesian Basin is sketchy.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"THE amount of gas development across Queensland's Bowen and Surat basins, if the four major liquefied natural gas plants planned for Gladstone all proceed, will be huge, a Brisbane conference has been told.
Each LNG proposal would cost something like $US15 billion ($A16.3 billion), taking into account spending on ``two train'' Gladstone plants and the ``up-stream'' development of the gas wells that would be needed to feed them.
 Coal seam gas well development is a much less intrusive activity than, say, open-cut coal mining. And over the life of an LNG plant, gas field development will continue, year in year out, providing a steady long-term economic boost, and jobs - hopefully balanced by an increase in social infrastructure - to communities around the gas fields, and further afield.
Grahame Baker, a long-time industry consultant with RLMS (Resource and Land Management Services), told the CSG 2010 conference in Brisbane last week that for each one million tonnes a year of LNG capacity that was built, 65 petajoules of gas would be required - something like 60PJ as feed stock and 5PJ to run the LNG plant.
If only 10 million tonnes of LNG capacity were built, he said - and that is less than the most advanced proponent, BG Group, is planning - some 650PJ a year of gas would be required.
That would double demand for gas in eastern Australia from its current level. And Mr Baker said producing that extra 650PJ a year would require 4900 gas wells, covering a combined area of 6150sq km.
If LNG capacity at Gladstone was to reach 28 million tonnes a year, requiring some 1820PJ, 13,700 wells would be needed, Mr Baker said, taking up an area of 17,150sq km.
At 40 million tonnes of LNG a year, the level that could be reached if three of the four projects went ahead and expanded to their planned maximum capacities of three or four LNG processing trains each, 19,600 production wells would be needed, which would take up 24,500sq km.
Meanwhile, Mr Baker didn't have any problem with the fact that CSG had not yet been used, anywhere in the world, as an LNG feedstock.
Despite that, he said CSG was generally very low in carbon dioxide content, which should reduce the capital and operating costs of the Gladstone plants, when compared with plants in Western Australia that have to strip CO2 from their product and capture it and reinject it to sequester the greenhouse gas.
Mr Baker pointed out that the Kenai LNG plant in Alaska had been using a ``dry gas, identical to CSG'' to produce LNG for export to Japan for 40 years.
The so-called Conoco- Phillips ``optimised cascade process for LNG production, which has been selected by three of the proposed Gladstone projects, was initially developed for the Kenai plant.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina are understood to have received Foreign Investment Review Board clearance for their $3.45 billion bid for coal seam gas company Arrow Energy.
The Australian Financial Review understands Shell and PetroChina Â­received the all-clear last week in a letter from FIRB, in turn satisfying one of the key conditions of the offer.
 The approval had loomed as a Â­potential sticking point for the takeÂ­over, given PetroChina's status as a state-owned company and a significant buyer of liquefied natural gas.
Under new guidelines issued by FIRB last year, major transactions Â­involving state-owned enterprises, in particular those in which a customer can gain control of an asset, are likely to come under greater scrutiny.
That, combined with the size of the Arrow deal and the perceived importance of the coal seam gas to LNG Â­industry to the Queensland economy, fuelled expectations the offer would be closely scrutinised by the FIRB. With the FIRB condition now satisfied, Shell and PetroChina have few conditions remaining. The offer still requires approval by shareholders and the courts, as well as an independent expert's report finding the takeover offer to be in the best interests of Â­Arrow shareholders.
Shell and PetroChina are offering $4.70 a share for Arrow's Queensland coal seam gas assets. Arrow shareholders are also set receive one share in a new Australian-listed company, Dart Energy, for each share already held in Arrow.
Dart will get Arrow's coal seam gas exploration assets in China, India, Â­Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as Â­Arrow's shareholdings in Australian-listed Apollo Gas, Bow Energy and Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd.
While Arrow has suggested each share in Dart could be worth around $1 each, Arrow shares have traded at an average price of $5.04 since the Â­Arrow board endorsed the Shell-PetroÂ­China offer.
New Hope Coal, Arrow's major shareholder with a 16.7 per cent stake, has said it will vote in favour of the Shell-PetroChina offer in the absence of a superior offer.
Another state-owned company, Malaysian energy giant Petronas, bought a 40 per cent stake in Santos's Queensland coal seam gas assets for $2.5 billion in 2008, before the recent toughening of conditions for state-owned enterprises.
Arrow shareholders are expected to vote on the proposal in mid-July.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"The Foreign Investment Review Board is still examining the Â­details of Royal Dutch Shell's and PetroÂ­China's $3.45 billion takeover offer for coal-seam gas company Arrow Â­Energy.

  Contrary to reports, we have not been notified by FIRB that Shell and PetroChina's application to acquire Arrow Energy has been approved,  Shell Australia chairman Russell Caplan said on Tuesdayyesterday yesterday.
 Shell and PetroÂ­China will continue to work with the FIRB and the Treasurer as they assess our joint Â­application. 
The approval is a key sticking point for the offer, given the state-owned status of PetroChina, one of the world's biggest companies. Under new foreign investment guidelines issued by FIRB last year, major transactions involving state-owned companies stand to come Â­under increased scrutiny. FIRB has also indicated it will examine closely any transaction in which a customer can gain control of an asset.
The most similar transaction to date was the acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Santos's Gladstone LNG project by Malaysia's Petronas in early 2008, although that deal was announced before FIRB issued its most recent guidelines on state-owned Â­companies.
Shell and PetroChina have formed a 50-50 joint venture to pursue Arrow.
They plan to jointly develop a liquefied natural gas facility at Curtis Â­Island off Gladstone in central Queensland, to process Arrow's Â­reserves.
They are offering $4.70 cash plus one share in a new Australian-listed spin-off company for each share in Arrow. Arrow has indicated that the spin-off company, Dart Energy, could be worth around $1 a share.
Shareholders in Arrow are set to vote on the proposal in mid-July.
Arrow's largest single shareholder, New Hope Coal, has said it intends to vote its 16.7 per cent interest in Arrow in favour of the takeover bid in the Â­absence of a superior offer.
PetroChina's involvement in the Â­Arrow takeover stands to be one of China's biggest investments in the Australian resources sector to date.

Shares in the Queensland-based Icon jumped 14.5 cents, or 47.54 per cent, to 45 cents.
 Icon is not yet producing LNG but says it will derive the productfrom coal seam gas (CSG) at its projects in eastern Australia.
The company said in a statement on Thursday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with a subsidiary of SinoGas Group Ltd.
It aims to execute a firm gas sales agreement with SinoGas Group for 40 million tonnes or 2.2 trillion cubic feet of LNG by August 31.
Icon has a market capitalisation just shy of $200 million and also has projects in Louisiana, United States.
Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed SinoGas is an investment holding company that operates petroleum, compressed natural gas and liquid petroleum gas refueling stations, and trades in gas-related products.
Icon says it aims to commence first shipments of LNG to China in 2014.
Icon managing director Ray James said the sales agreement was the next logical step in the company's evolution from gas explorer to producer and supplier.
The agreement follows one of Australia's largest trade deals last month when China National Offshore Oil Corp agreed to purchase about $60 billion worth of LNG derived from CSG from a Queensland project operated by Britain's BG Group.
Days later, BG Group signed a deal with Tokyo Gas for $20 billion worth of LNG derived from CSG.
Landholdings prospective for CSG are hot property and analysts say few takeover targets remain in the now consolidated sector.

WestSide, which last month said it would acquire the Dawson Seamgas coal seam gasfields in the Bowen Basin from Anglo American and Mitsui Moura Investment, has revealed it will raise $64.4 million to cover acquisition and development costs.
 Under the fully underwritten offer, the fund managers will take share placements worth $8.1 million at 55Â¢ a share and together underwrite a $56.3 million, 1-for-1 entitlement offer of new shares for existing shareholders.
The funding and underwriting package equates to a $23.3 million funding investment in WestSide for New Hope, which will have a 19.9 per cent stake in the company, and a $15.8 million outlay from Energy Infrastructure Trust for a 13.5 per cent interest. Eventual ownership levels could change, depending on any shortfall in offer acceptances.
New Hope chief executive Rob Neale and John Clarke, managing director of Energy Infrastructure Trust's parent, Infrastructure Capital Group, will also join the WestSide board, providing a big boost to the strength and credibility of the company.
New Hope's 17 per cent holding in Arrow was recently considered a key determinant in whether Shell and PetroChina's joint $3.44 billion takeover bid for Arrow would succeed. Energy Infrastructure Trust had almost 8 per cent in QGC before the BG bid.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,2,"Every day in the media we are overloaded with news concerning global warming and environmental issues. Governments at all levels waffle on about how itâ€™s at crisis point and more must be done to ensure the world can survive. They donâ€™t however seem to be prepared to knock more projects on the head â€“ that after all would knock the coffers! On the flip side there is that fantastic TV advertisement promoting coal seam gas; the one with the catchy tune, â€œBring it on; thereâ€™s work to be doneâ€?.
Itâ€™s full of happy primary producers working together â€“ it paints a harmonious picture; nothing to worry about there! As a landowner in the middle of a coal seam gas field, I am worried.
 Not just for my familyâ€™s future, but for that of our entire region. All we hear about is the â€œpositive repercussionsâ€? the mining industry is set to have on our region.
True it may have saved the area from falling in a heap following years of ongoing drought, but does anyone stop and think about what lies ahead once the gas and coal is extracted and the big guns have moved on?
I am sure many will read this and say â€œoh just another whinging farmerâ€? but this is not just an issue affecting farmers; this is a threat to all. We already have wells and pipelines on our property.
We have already been through the heartache of seeing our land transformed, but now we are trying to come to grips with the long term environmental threats these companies pose, not just to us personally, but to all.
Having recently reviewed an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for one of these companies, there are so many potential complications that need to be brought to the attention of all people.
There are issues of water, there are issues of by-products and sadly these issues donâ€™t get the attention they should. Why they havenâ€™t been addressed prior to now is a farce. They are concerns that should have been factored into the equation way before the coal seam gas industry was given the green light.
Attention has recently been drawn to the coal seam gas industry and the handling of their by-product, salt. One proposal is burying the salt and brine underground, wrapped up naturally to control contamination!
This is not just meagre amount of salt; we are talking millions of tonnes. I believe it to be extremely short sighted and negligent to future generations to discard the salt and brine in landfill. The future is unknown.
Burying millions of tonnes of salt underground, where there is no doubt one or several of these landfill sites will eventually leak, and forever cause problems, potentially contaminating land and water resources.
Future generations should not have to deal with the problems this industry stands to leave. It should be treated and dealt with now by those companies who stand to make billions in the short term.
Make them deal with their waste responsibly, just as every other industry has to.
Another area of major concern is that of bore water tables. In this particular EIS Statement the company states in their Implementation Strategy that they need to â€œDevelop a final trigger value for the percentage draw down level at which some form of remedial or compensatory action is required for the affected bore ownersâ€?.
The above statement basically confirms that the processes these companies are undertaking are, or have the potential, to affect the water tables. If the aquifers we local landholders currently use are depleted, how are we supposed to survive? So many landholders are heavily dependent on this resource and its collapse would have a devastating impact on their livelihoods.
Obviously such circumstances would put many people out of business, and with no or little water, their property would be worth nothing. The scary thing is that this scenario could be repeated ten thousand times over with landowners in the Surat Basin.
As landowners located in the middle of this development there are so many concerns we have. I put the little faith I have in the current government to look beyond the significant dollar value these companies set to inject and instead consider the potential devastating social and environmental impact these industries have.
So when the â€œBring it onâ€? catch cry next rolls across your TV screen, please donâ€™t get lost in the rosy footage; stop and think about the underlying issues that are set to affect us all.

SHARES in coal-seam gas junior WestSide surged to a nearly three-year high yesterday after it unveiled a plan to raise $64.4 million to purchase and expand Anglo American's Queensland CSG assets.
 It also revealed it had brought on board established CSG investors New Hope Coal and Energy Infrastructure Trust, which were cornerstone investors in Arrow Energy and Queensland Gas respectively. WestSide last month agreed to buy 51 per cent of Dawson for $26.8m. Yesterday, WestSide said it planned to raise $8.1m in placements to New Hope and EIT at 55c a share.
It also plans a fully underwritten non-renounceable entitlement offer at 45c a share to raise a further $56.3m. Of the funds, $30m will be used to expand production at the site. WestSide shares jumped 15.5c to 71c, their highest since mid-2007.
``It's definitely a good deal for WestSide, it de-risks the purchase, sorting the funding out and providing quality cornerstone investors,'' said Patersons Securities analyst Scott Simpson.
New Hope, which will receive about $576m for its 16.7 per cent stake in Arrow through Shell and PetroChina's combined bid, has agreed to buy 8.8 million WestSide shares for $4.8m, giving it a 7 per cent stake.

Steel maker Salzgitter, truck maker MAN and chipmaker Infineon Technologies led the charge, up more than 2 per cent each. Car maker Porsche climbed 1.9 per cent while preferred shares in Volkswagen were up 2.3 per cent on the back of strong US car sales data.
Flying high
The Korean Business Index showed the highest reading in almost eight years when it was released by the Bank of Korea last week. The index rose to 105 for April, the highest mark since June 2002, as it crossed over the important 100 level, which signifies more optimism than pessimism in business outlook. Subcomponents of the index reveal South Korean manufacturers expect higher sales volume, price increases, new orders and profit margins. Firms also expect inventory levels to fall, with the inventory index at its lowest level in 10 years.
Reluctant movers drive market
British house prices soared almost 250 per cent between 1992 and autumn 2007 before the run on Northern Rock signalled the dawn of the UK's financial crisis. House prices fell 15 per cent over the ensuing 18 months, more than in any other European country. Since the height of the recession early last year, UK house prices have defied predictions and rallied about 5 per cent. One theory to explain the rise is a shortage of supply as home owners resist moving, leaving fewer properties for first-home buyers, demand from whom is driving up the market.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Coalminer New Hope Corporation has agreed to acquire a substantial interest in Queensland explorer WestSide Corporation, maintaining its exposure to Australian coal seam gas.
Two weeks ago, New Hope committed to selling its 16.7 per cent stake in established coal seam gas producer Arrow Energy into Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina's takeover bid for Â­Arrow. Yesterday, it said it would pay $4.8 million for 7 per cent of WestSide.
 The share sale to New Hope is part of a fully underwritten $64.4 million capital raising by WestSide to finance the acquisition of a 51 per cent interest in the Dawson coal seam gas field in Queensland's Bowen Basin and its development.
New Hope managing director Robert Neale told The Australian Financial Review yesterday WestSide was appealing because it was poised to move from exploring to producing and has good growth prospects.
He said the investment was part of a diversification strategy that began in 2006 when New Hope invested in Arrow and which has also seen the company branch out into coal-to-liquids technology and geothermal energy.
 As we see good opportunities to diversify across the energy spectrum from coal through gas and so on, we'll continue doing that,  he said.
New Hope has $1.3 billion in cash and, provided the Shell-PetroChina takeover goes ahead, will collect $576.2 million from the sale of its stake in Arrow.
Chairman Robert Millner said last month the company intended to use the cash to buy producing coal assets in Australia but that management was having trouble finding anything suitable.
New Hope could raise its stake in WestSide to as much as 19 per cent through participation in â€“ and as co-underwriter of â€“ a 1-for-1 entitlement offer at 45Â¢ a share to raise up to $56.3 million.
Mr Neale declined to comment on whether New Hope had plans to increase its holding in WestSide above the initial 7 per cent if that did not happen in the entitlement offer.
As part of its capital raising, WestSide also will sell shares worth $3.23 million to Energy Infrastructure Trust, a specialist trust managed by Infrastructure Capital Group.
Shares in WestSide rose 15.5Â¢ or 28 per cent to 71Â¢ yesterday and shares in New Hope rose 2Â¢ to $5.39.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"SHARES in junior coal seam gas hopeful Icon Energy have almost doubled following the company's announcement that it had signed a memorandum of understanding worth as much as $32 billion to supply liquefied natural gas to China.
The deal, between Icon and Shenzhen Sino Industrial Development Company, a subsidiary of SinoGas, means Icon will supply 40 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas over 20 years from 2014.
 A binding deal needs to be signed by August 31. Icon shares soared 14.5Â¢, or 48 per cent, to 45Â¢.
 The deal positions Icon Energy as the exclusive supplier of approximately 2.2 trillion cubic feet over the 20-year life of the agreement,  the company said.  Icon Energy plans to meet the contractual requirements via its current tenements in South Australia and Queensland, arrangements with existing joint venture partners, new farm-in agreements and the securing of additional tenements. 
A research note by Intersuisse published last month said Icon's ability to service the gas contract would depend on whether it could commercialise its Queensland and South Australian tenements.
Intersuisse said in the note:  Results from recent drilling activity undertaken by Icon in ATP 626P [in Queensland] . . . indicate that the coals are much more complex than previously thought and that much more work will be required to unlock the secret to establishing sustained and economic gas flow from these wells.
 In the long run, investors should be rewarded for their patience and will be able to witness the establishment of a commercial gas field in ATP 626P.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"â€œI always believed actions speak louder than words and good news doesnâ€™t need promoting, it promotes itself.â€?
Environmental Property Protection Association chairman Ian Hayllor threw the challenge out to the State Government and the gas and energy companies to give more clarity on the effect of coal seam gas (CSG) on the Surat Basin yesterday.
 Ian was just one of three speakers to give the landholdersâ€™ perspective at yesterdayâ€™s CSG forum at Dalby RSL.
The forum attracted more than 200 people with C4B, AgForce and other groups represented, but the audience were predominantly landholders.
Solicitor Peter Shannon of Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers said it was the first forum he knew of driven by landholders rather than industry or government.
â€œIâ€™m astounded at the roll up, it was organised in the space of about a week and not widely advertised,â€? Peter said.
â€œThe grapevine worked amazingly and it showed the depth of the feeling
â€œThe landowners are crying out for balance, less hype and more help.â€?
Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers sponsored the forum with attendees coming from as far as Gunnedah.
The NSW Farmers Associationâ€™s Presidential Mining Task Force sent representatives in preparation for the upcoming exploration and eventual mining of the Gunnedah Basin.
Judi Sheedy (from the group) said that Queensland was a lot further down the track with contracts being signed, but that NSW wanted to take advantage of the knowledge available at the forum.
â€œWe need to find out what the next step is as many of our members are now looking at access agreements, these issues are of national importance,â€? Judi said.
Peter became acutely aware of the need for a forum following dealings with landholders trying to negotiate the CSG minefield.
â€œThe motivation is from the fact that Iâ€™ve been working for a while now with landholders dealing with gas companies concerned with the lack of any widespread knowledge or understanding of just how one-sided the process is,â€? he said.
â€œWhat tipped me was the fact that I couldnâ€™t find out what the trigger threshold levels were in order to establish the companiesâ€™ liability to â€˜make goodâ€™.
â€œWhen I got talking to a few landholders it was apparent that they were anxious to co-ordinate some sort of information exchange.â€?
The forum mainly focussed on the water which is a by-product of CSG and how it would be disposed of or treated.
Landholders were urged to try and communicate with the companies rather than just shut the door to prevent the Land Court becoming involved.
It was stressed that the difficulties were arising from bureaucratic red tape and the failure of government legislation to lay down guidelines.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,2,"Metgasco plans 140km Qld pipeline to feed world's insatiable demand for LNG
CASINOâ€™S coal seam gas could be headed for Japan and China if gas company Metgascoâ€™s plan to build a 140km pipeline from Casino to Ipswich gets a tick from the government regulator.
 Metgasco managing director David Johnson said the pipe, if approved, would connect with another pipe sending natural gas to Gladstone, where it could be liquefied and loaded on to ships.
The pipeline, either 25cm or 51cm in diameter, would be buried more than 1.5 metres underground and would follow the Lions Road across the Border Ranges. It would cost about $120 million and Mr Johnson said Metgasco was still looking through the different ways it could finance the project.
Mr Johnson said the market dem- and and dollars on offer for liquid natural gas were â€˜mind-bogglingâ€™.
About a fortnight ago, BG Group announced a $60 billion deal to supply Queensland liquid natural gas to China for the next 20 years. It backed up that announcement a week later saying it had signed a deal with Tokyo Gas and Electric to provide another $40 billion worth of the clean energy, gleaned from Queenslandâ€™s Surat Basin.
â€œThis is a substantial opportunity, if we can get our gas to Ipswich,â€? he said.
Metgasco is still working on its environmental assessment for the pipeline, which Mr Johnson expected to lodge with the regulator â€˜within a few monthsâ€™. Assuming all boxes were ticked, the regulatory and approval process is expected to take until 2013. Construction of the pipeline would take another year.
Mr Johnson conceded there would have to be some land clearing to lay the pipeline, mainly to bring in equipment needed to do the work.
â€œOnce the pipes are buried and (the bushland) is allowed to regrow, the footprint would be very minimal,â€? he said.
The pipeline and the dollars on offer from South-East Asia would have no impact on the companyâ€™s plans to provide gas and power from Casino, he said.
Mr Johnson said the effort of building natural gas pipelines to and through Casino would be a greater challenge than the Queensland line, but it was still worthwhile for the company.
â€œItâ€™s our intention to sell the gas where we see the opportunity to do so,â€? he said.
â€œThere is currently only a small and limited market in Casino, but we regard that as sufficiently important that it is our intention, as early as possible, to establish gas production that is available for local consumption.â€?
Part of that as a recognition that if you take a resource from an area that resource ought to be available in that area. However, Casinoâ€™s gas network would be no charity project.
â€œThe dollars we earn within the Casino region would be as important as the dollars we earn from elsewhere,â€? he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"Icon Energy (ICN) 45c
THOSE unconvinced we're in another resources boom should look no further than coal seam gas minnow Icon Energy's pronouncement of a $23-32 billion LNG offtake deal -- by way of a memorandum of understanding -- with a subsidiary of China's SinoGas Group.
 Such monster deals have been routinely struck in the gas game. The wee difference with Icon -- and sorry to be picky -- is that it has no formal resource. Icon's main working project, the Lydia prospect in the Surat Basin, has produced useful flows, but its commercial viability is far from proven. Icon says it will honour the commitment to supply 40 million tonnes of LNG (over 20 years) via its existing tenements and joint ventures, as well as new farm-ins and tenements.
As for the plant, one theory is that Icon (and partners) will strike a deal with LNG Limited (LNG), which has been left without a dance partner for its proposed Fisherman's Landing plant after Arrow Energy waltzed off with Shell. Another theory is that Icon could become the gatekeeper for SinoGas, which is exclusively tied to Icon, to do a deal with another supplier. Icon shares yesterday rallied 50 per cent and more than doubled at one stage. We suspect the details won't be as compelling as the billion-dollar headline stuff and rate Icon a sell. As Twiggy knows, there's a world of difference between an MoU and a binding contract.
Perseus Mining (PRU) $2.05
STILL on big announcements, gold junior Perseus has trumpeted grades of up to 1216 grams a tonne at its Tengrela project on the Ivory Coast.
Tengrela is the second-string project to Central Ashanti in Ghana, a 7 million-ounce gorilla. Tengrela already has a 1 million-ounce resource, with a maiden reserves statement due by June's end. Combined, the projects put Perseus on course to be the third-biggest Australian-based producer with annual output of 400,000 ounces a year, which makes us wonder whether Newcrest, which has lobbed a bid for Lihir, chose the wrong target.
Criterion had Perseus as a spec buy at $1.24 last September and then a sell in December at $1.95. Miners, like children, should be rewarded for good grades so we'll promote Perseus to a hold.
Sigma Pharmaceuticals (SIP) 46c
SIGMA CEO Elmo de Alwis and finance sidekick Mark Smith have been doing the rounds of the instos after last week's train-crash results disclosure, with a ``trust us'' message about turning around the pharma group's fortunes. ``They looked a little bit beaten down,'' says one attendee.
One popular topic was how Sigma will reduce its debt load and find $90 million to meet debt repayments due in September. One option being considered is not to sell the Herron headache brand holus bolus, but only the grocery bit. The sale of surplus plant in Brisbane and Melbourne would fund the rest.
The inquisitors were also keen to know how management would restore current-year earnings to the 2008-09 level of $80m, having made an underlying $67.7m in 2009-10. The answer, we gather, was not altogether convincing.
Criterion had Sigma as an avoid 46.5c last Thursday. At some point it will become a decent recovery punt, but it's still too early to change our tune.
ASX Ltd (ASX) $33.81
THE home of capitalism retains the faith of broking analysts, despite the threat of new competition and disappointing March trading numbers.
Five brokers issued reports yesterday, with three (Merrill Lynch, RBS Australia and UBS) retaining ``buy'' calls and two (Credit Suisse and Macquarie) opting for ``hold'' (or equivalent) recommendations.
ASX shares have lost 3 per cent since Canberra last week approved ``in principle'' the Nomura-backed Chi-X's application. But a lengthy delay can be expected as the government wants to bed down the transfer of supervisory powers from the ASX to ASIC.
On Macquarie's reckoning, incumbent exchanges elsewhere have lost 10-20 per cent of their market cap when faced with a rival. Chi-X has flagged aggressive pricing competition, but there's no sense of a Doomsday threat.
Criterion last had ASX as an avoid at $34.07 last August. On consensus estimates, ASX is trading at 17 times expected current-year earnings. We question whether this growth premium is deserved and retain the call.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,2,"COAL seam gas has been found at Fullerton Cove, raising hopes of further discoveries in the Hunter.
The find was described as a  potential new gas resource on the doorstep of Newcastle .
 Arrow Energy and Apollo Gas made a joint statement to the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday about the results of exploratory drilling at Fullerton Cove.
 Early test results confirm the presence of a significant gas resource only 15 kilometres from an established gas market in Newcastle,  Arrow Energy Australia chief executive Shaun Scott said.
 We are looking forward to moving quickly to the next phase of exploration. 
It was too early to estimate the value of the resource.
The company had exploration rights over an area called  Petroleum Exploration Licence 458 , which covers parts of east Lake Macquarie, Newcastle, Port Stephens and Dungog.
A company statement said the first stage of exploration had focused on Fullerton Cove.
More exploration drilling was planned in other Hunter areas.
Drilling was done at two exploration wells at Fullerton Cove in the past month and work was progressing on two other wells in the area.
 The results from the Fullerton Cove program are very encouraging and confirm the presence of thick, gassy coal seams,  the statement said.
The project will be transferred to a new company called Dart Energy.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"A Gold Coast company with no commercial gas reserves has signed a deal to sell up to $32 billion of liquefied natural gas to China.
Icon Energy signed the blockbuster memorandum of understanding on Thursday yesterday with the little-known Shenzhen-based SinoGas Group, which had just $32 million in registered capital in April 2008. Icon is searching for coal seam gas in Queensland.
 Icon's shares closed up 47.5 per cent at 45Â¢ yesterday, valuing the company at $197.5 million.
The agreement is part of the Â­recent trend of small Australian resource companies signing eye-catching deals with Asian buyers.
In March, Blue Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korea's Kogas, the world's biggest importer of natural gas. The same month gas developer Energy World Corporation hived off a chunk of its interÂ­national assets to Japan's largest utility, Tokyo Gas, sending Energy World shares up 59 per cent.
Icon has pledged to supply 40Â million tonnes of LNG over two decades to SinoGas. Icon values the deal between $23 billion and $32 billion, depending on oil prices at the time of export.
SinoGas expects to receive its first gas from Icon by 2014, according to one source close to the deal, and has completed a feasibility study to build a $727 million LNG receiving terminal in China.
The source said SinoGas received local government approval for the facility in January and has submitted its development plan to China's National Development and Reform Commission for final approval.
Icon plans to provide the gas from its four main tenements in South Australia and Queensland and will also look to tie up additional supply arrangements before the gas sales agreement is executed on 31 August.
However, analysts are concerned over the lack of detail about where gas will come from and uncertainty over how Icon plans to clear the necessary regulatory hurdles to export gas to China.
Icon has yet to produce commercial quantities of gas from its own fields but is confident that Â­ongoing drilling will yield sufficient supplies to proceed with the deal.
 This is really a pie-in-the-sky deal,  said a Hong Kong-based Â­energy analyst.
 I have no idea how Icon intends to get this gas and whether the project is even economic. You would have to say it is highly speculative at this stage. 
Last month, BG finalised a record $65 billion binding LNG sales agreement with China Â­National Offshore Oil Company for supplies from its Queensland Curtis project.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"NEW State Government regulations mean miners will investigate themselves if their drilling for gas affects underground water.
Under regulations announced yesterday by Mines Minister Stephen Robertson, coal seam gas miners will investigate aquifers where water drops below certain levels.
 They will then work out a solution and negotiate repairs with land owners whose bores are affected.
Farmers and conservationists say this will see farmers with few resources and little negotiating experience deal with mining company professionals.
Self monitoring is used in many industries but the multibillion-dollar CSG industry in the Surat basin has alarmed farmers and conservationists. Shots have even been fired as locals oppose miners.
Miners Bow Energy and QGC have both previously said they cannot guarantee deep drilling will not affect aquifers.
Wayne Newton, spokesman for farm industry body Agforce, said the small regulatory step was appreciated but years late.
``CSG companies have not been submitting reports on the extraction of water which occurs incidentally during gas extraction,'' he said.
``We know what will happen. Farmers will see water levels drop and miners will claim the reduction is merely due to seasonal conditions because no baseline data has been collated.''
Queensland Conservation Council co-ordinator Toby Hutcheon said the Government was setting up a system in which the farmer would always be the loser.
Mr Robertson said the Queensland Water Commission would oversee monitoring and miners would have to send them operational reports.
Mr Newton said CSG companies should have to pay for independent baseline studies to determine aquifer levels before mining began and monitoring should be overseen by the Environment Department.
Mr Robertson said the regime would come into force in August. Trigger thresholds would be set for when a 5m drop in water levels was recorded in aquifers such as sandstone and a 2m drop for shallow alluvial aquifers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"The complicated ownership structures of Queensland's coal seam gas fields has the potential to become a legal minefield for the region's big players, and Origin Energy would appear to be the one with the most to lose.
An exhaustive analysis of the fields by Deutsche analyst John Hirjee has untangled the ownership structures, and has found that BGÂ Group and Santos operate 100Â per cent and 97 per cent of their reserves respectively. That gives the pair the over-riding say on when and how their reserves are developed.
 In contrast, Origin operates a comparatively paltry 67 per cent of its gas reserves.
The upshot is that Origin may have to entertain more deals such as its recent transaction with BG, in which Origin agreed to sell its share of gas from two BG-operated fields into BG's liquefied natural gas project.
Hirjee says there are about 797Â petajoules of gas owned by Origin at Santos' Fairview-Arcadia field which, assuming the BG deal is replicated, could provide a good boost to the reserve base underpinning Santos' LNG plans. However it comes straight out of the reserves in mind for Origin's own LNG project. But because Origin is one of Santos's largest domestic gas customers, Hirjee thinks it is unlikely that any deal between the pair would end up highly one-sided.

Coal seam gas is the rage but certainty of supply means the west coast's LNG projects remain viable, writes Perry Williams.
 With a host of multi-billion-dollar deals having been struck in Queensland's booming coal-seam gas industry in March, Western Australia has found itself in the unexpected position of temporarily playing second fiddle to the emerging unconventional gas rush on Australia's east coast.
The upturn in global energy demand from Asia and a desire for cleaner-burning sources of energy is continuing to drive interest in Australia's gas reserves.
Yet while the clamour around extracting coal from gas fields is likely to continue for some time, large-scale conventional projects in the country's west still dominate Australia's energy sector.
With liquified natural gas projects often costing tens of billions of dollars to develop, conventional gas projects such as the $43 billion Gorgon LNG project and the first phase of the Pluto LNG facility in WA have received strong backing from gas-hungry Asian buyers, enabling crucial financing to be secured.
PetroChina has committed to a 20-year, 2.3 million tonne-a-year contract with ExxonMobil at Gorgon while Chinese buyers will purchase 82.5 million tonnes of LNG from the North-West Shelf LNG consortium over 25 years.
 There are significant growth opportunities for these projects ahead, given we are at the start of what looks like a multi-decade growth cycle in gas that will see double-digit gas growth over the next 10 years,  says Neil Beveridge, senior analyst at Singapore's Bernstein Research.
Woodside Petroleum leads the charge with plans to boost its share of LNG production from 3 million tonnes a year to about 20 million tonnes a year by 2020 via the Pluto, Sunrise and Browse developments.
The Pluto project is under construction and on track to deliver its first gas by the end of 2010, which will make it only the third LNG project built in Australia.
But the company faces an uphill battle to secure enough gas supplies to feed Pluto's future expansion.
The Perth-based company has drilled five exploration wells in a large 20-well program aimed at finding sufficient gas to support the project's expansion, with four resulting in discoveries.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte hopes those early successes will pave the way for the oil major to prove it holds enough gas to proceed with a final decision on the second phase of Pluto by the end of 2010.
Woodside also has high hopes for its Browse and Sunrise LNG projects.
Woodside announced in February that its joint-venture partners BHP Billiton, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP had agreed to back its plan for Browse to build a processing facility on WA's Kimberley coast, removing an obstacle for the project.
The joint-venture partners will spend $1.25 billion over the next two years on design studies, ahead of a final decision by mid-2012 on whether to sanction the project.
Woodside is also investigating development options for the Sunrise project in the Timor Sea, which aims to deliver 5 million tonnes a year of LNG by 2016.
Other conventional LNG plays include North American oil major Chevron which aims to produce 8.6Â million tonnes a year of LNG from the Wheatstone project with a final investment decision due in 2011, while Japan's Inpex will decide on the fate of its planned $20Â billion Ichthys LNG project in northern Australia by late 2010.
Deutsche Bank argues that despite the rise of CSG-derived projects, there remains a clear bias from buyers toward conventional projects on the west coast, with nearly five conventional deals signed for every CSG agreement.
With the exception of Woodside's planned expansion of the Pluto plant, the bank says Australia's west coast LNG projects are favoured due in part to high certainty over project reserves.
 Projects such as Gorgon, Ichthys and Wheatstone appear to have excess gas resources beyond current development plans, notwithstanding drilling success, suggesting a potential for future expansion,  says Deutsche analyst John Hirjee.
Yet with half of all proposed global LNG projects located in Australia, concerns are mounting that building so much supply over a short time could lead to project bottlenecks, industrial action and potential delays.
Woodside has already warned that illegal strikes at its Pluto LNG project could hurt its construction schedule and has put together a contingency plan in case the $12 billion project is delayed. About half the workforce walked off the job for eight days earlier this year in a dispute over accommodation.
Concerns have also been raised over the long-term demand forecast for LNG.
Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie cut its forecast for global LNG demand to 2020 by 22 per cent, to 364 million tonnes a year, from 466 million tonnes a year in 2008. This was partly due to the rise of unconventional shale gas supplies for domestic use in the United States.
Woodside also cut its global LNG demand forecast by 10 per cent for 2020, to 360 million tonnes a year.
Macquarie Research has warned that on current demand forecasts, only half of the LNG projects in Australia not yet subject to engineering and design studies could be supported, with collaboration between project owners likely over the medium term.
Banking on LNG
* Almost five LNG deals are signed for every CSG agreement, says Deutsche Bank.
* Woodside Petroleum plans to increase its share of LNG production from 3 million tonnes a year to 20 million tonnes by 2020.
* But there are concerns about the long-term demand forecast for LNG as well as potential project delays.

A flurry of activity has confirmed the potential firepower of Australia's coal-seam gas sector, writes Paul Garvey
 A wave of big-ticket deals and the promise of billions more in future investment has firmly reminded investors that eastern Australia is awash with gas.
In recent weeks, China has led two major deals in Australia's burgeoning coal-seam gas sector, which was all but unknown just a handful of years ago.
Firstly, there was a landmark $80 billion deal that all but guaranteed the go-ahead for Queensland's first liquefied natural gas project. China National Offshore Oil Corp confirmed its intention to buy 3.6 million tonnes of LNG a year from BG Group's proposed Queensland Curtis LNG project for 20 years, in a deal dubbed Australia's single largest company-to-company trade deal.
The commitment from CNOOC is the world's first binding sales agreement for LNG produced from coal-seam gas and clears the way for London-based BG to approve the development of Queensland Curtis LNG later this year.
The other key deal was a $3.45 billion takeover bid from Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina for Arrow Energy, the largest remaining independent coal-seam gas company.
That deal marked China's most aggressive move to date in the coal-seam gas sector, PetroChina and Shell forming a 50-50 joint venture to develop a coal-seam gas-fed LNG plant.
The BG project alone, which Deutsche Bank estimates will cost $20.1 billion to build, is expected to generate up to 8500 jobs during Â­construction, but it is just one of no less than five coal-seam gas-fed LNG plants planned for construction in Queensland.
On top of the PetroChina-Shell development, Adelaide-based Santos and Malaysia's Petronas have a joint venture to develop the Gladstone LNG project; Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips are studying the development of the Australia Pacific LNG project; while Perth-based LNG Ltd is adamant it will proceed with its Fisherman's Landing project despite its agreed gas supplier, Arrow Energy, being snapped up.
All of this from an industry considered little more than a niche business a handful of years ago.
Queensland's coal-seam gas potential has been acknowledged for years, and has been estimated at an incredible 200 trillion cubic feet of gas.
But coal-seam gas wells produce far less gas than wells in conventional gasfields such as those in Western Australia, meaning that, historically, they have received little attention.
But the sheer abundance of coal-seam gas means that, through the drilling of thousands of wells, enough gas can be harnessed to support the development of monstrous LNG projects to allow for export into energy-hungry, higher-priced international markets.
CNOOC's agreement to buy the LNG from BG's Queensland Curtis LNG project was momentous for coal-seam gas companies other than BG.
It was a major endorsement of the process of sourcing LNG from coal-seam gas, which is still something of an unknown quantity.
The CNOOC agreement makes BG the first of the coal-seam-gas-to-LNG proponents to secure a firm, fully termed sales contract and came amid concerns that the international LNG market had swung in favour of buyers, due to the large number of LNG projects that are currently slated for development.
Analysts had warned that coal-seam gas companies could struggle to attract strong prices due to the unproven nature of the industry.
Apart from BG and CNOOC, Santos has a binding heads of agreement to sell gas to Malaysia's Petronas, while Origin and ConocoPhillips hope to secure a customer this year.
With LNG projects costing up to tens of billions of dollars to develop, firm, long-term contracts are necessary in order to secure financing.
The key remaining hurdle is Â­environmental approval from the Queensland and federal governments.
Both Santos and BG have lodged their supplementary environmental impact statements and are waiting on the Â­final clearance.
Origin meanwhile, recently formally lodged the environmental impact statement for its Australia Pacific LNG joint venture.
On the consolidation front, Shell and PetroChina's bid for Arrow has re-ignited expectations that more coal-seam gas takeovers could be in the works.
Shell and PetroChina are offering $4.70 a share for Arrow's Australian businesses, with Arrow shareholders also set to receive one share in a new Australian-listed company, Dart Energy, for each share already held in Arrow.
Dart will get Arrow's coal-seam gas exploration assets in China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam; and Arrow's shareholdings in Australian-listed Apollo Gas, Bow Energy and Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. Critically, Shell has also agreed to give up buy-in rights it held over Arrow's overseas acreage, giving potential shareholders in Dart far greater exposure to any discoveries the new company makes.
The cash component is a 35 per cent premium to Arrow's share price before The Australian Financial Review broke the news of the original takeover approach.
The likely sale will make Shell a major player in Australia's emerging coal-seam gas industry, and the Anglo-Dutch company is likely to use Arrow's gas reserves to feed a multi-billion-dollar liquefied natural gas plant at Curtis Island, near Gladstone in central Queensland.
Shareholders are expected to vote on the spin-off of Dart and the sale of Arrow to Shell and PetroChina in mid-July; 75 per cent of the votes required to be in favour of the proposals before the deals can proceed.
The likely sale of Arrow will cap a meteoric rise for the company, which listed in August 2000 with a market capitalisation of $10.5 million and a share price of 20Â¢. In September 2006, it was trading at less than 60Â¢ a share.
Arrow's growth has been driven by a surge of major international investments in Queensland's coal-seam gas sector, which was little more than a boutique industry three years ago.
The Arrow takeover bid by Shell and PetroChina is just the latest in a long line of major deals in Australia's coal-seam gas sector.
BG has been particularly active, acquiring coal-seam gas pioneer Queensland Gas Co for $5 billion in 2008 and Pure Energy Resources for $1 billion in 2009.
Santos struck the first big coal-seam gas deal in 2008, selling a 40 per cent stake in its Gladstone LNG project for $US2.5 billion.
And Origin Energy sold 50 per cent of its coal-seam gas to LNG project to ConocoPhillips for $9.6 billion as it fended off a hostile takeover offer from BG.
Wilson HTM analyst John Young says the elements that attracted Shell and PetroChina to Arrow are the same ones that attracted other international majors such as BG Group, Petronas and ConocoPhillips into the sector, and could well lure more players to partner with the next crop of emerging coal-seam gas explorers.
 Arrow offers a world-scale gas resource located in close proximity to Asia, the region of expected greatest growth in the coming decades, in a politically stable jurisdiction and which has been demonstrated can be produced at low cost,  Young says.  PetroChina is seeking access to large-scale resources to feed growing Asian, and in particular Chinese, gas demand, and may consider the joint venture with Shell increases the possibility of receiving Australian government approval. 
Unsurprisingly, the latest bid has been a boon for the next crop of coal-seam gas explorers.
Bow Energy, WestSide Corp, Molopo Australia and Eastern Star Gas are among the numerous junior companies that have entered the coal-seam gas sector in the hope of replicating the success of Arrow and Queensland Gas.
The four have all identified coal-seam gas reserves, meaning they are likely to come on the radar of any of the sector's bigger players who are hoping to add to their gas reserve positions.
What a gas
* There have been two major coal-seam gas deals lead by China in recent weeks.
* One is the world's first binding LNG from coal-seam gas deal.
* The sector's potential is huge, Queensland's coal-seam gas capacity having been estimated at 200 trillion cubic feet of gas.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"AS MACARTHUR Coal's board fields bids for the company, another reminder has come in from overseas that in the resources sector, waiting is the game to play.
China state-owned oil group Sinopec has just paid Origin Energy's coal seam gas partner, Conoco Phillips, $US4.65 billion ($A5 billion) for a 9 per cent stake in Syncrude, the world's largest producer of synthetic crude oil from the Athabasca Oil Sands in the western Canadian province of Alberta.
 And the Chinese company has paid a very big price. It beats the high end of an estimate by Macquarie Bank's resources analysis unit by about $US650 million, and values Syncrude's total reserves, 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent, at $US10.33 a barrel. ExxonMobil is currently valued at $US4.33 a barrel by the sharemarket, and Syncrude's 36.7 per cent listed shareholder, the Canadian Oil Sands Trust, was trading at $US5.61 a barrel before the deal.
The deal is relevant to any company here that owns commodities that China wants, including Macarthur, because it reinforces the fact that China is now the price setter.
Its demand is underpinning commodity prices, mining and oil profits and the values the market is placing on resources companies based on earnings and cash-flow multiples.
And as this week's Syncrude deal shows, it is also prepared to pay above and beyond those market values to ease its future call on  external  supplies and the price pressure that call creates.
And it is already a major force in this market, through deals including last year's $3.5 billion coal takeover of Felix Resources by Yanzhou Coal, Baosteel's $286 million iron ore investment in Aquila Resources, PetroChina's decision to partner Shell in a recommended $3.4 billion bid for the Queensland coal seam gas project developer Arrow and Sinopec's $722 million acquisition of 60 per cent of locally listed AED Oil's Puffin oilfield in the Timor Sea a year ago.
Macarthur had little to say yesterday, beyond confirming the obvious â€” that two of its big three shareholders, ArcelorMittal (16.6 per cent) and Posco (8.3 per cent), haven't made up their minds, despite Noble's assertion that they support Noble's planned move to a 24 per cent stake in Macarthur through a share exchange bid by Macarthur for 87.7 per cent Noble-owned Gloucester Coal and Macarthur's purchase of Noble's 30 per cent stake in Macarthur's Middlemount iron ore mine.
And the remaining big holder, Chinese state-owned Citic (22.4 per cent), will also be waiting to see if Xstrata firms up an offer, or if the declared suitors, Peabody and New Hope, make new pitches before the postponed meeting of Macarthur shareholders on Monday to consider the Noble deal.
In a heated global resources takeover environment such as this one, patience costs Macarthur and its shareholders nothing, and the Noble deal functions as the default: if the other bids don't prevail, shareholders still have the option of approving it and bringing Noble on board, but also maintaining Macarthur's independence, and its listing.
Macarthur shares fell 3.5 per cent to $15.95 yesterday as no new bids surfaced and would fall further if Noble's deal gets up. But after the Noble deal Macarthur would still be available, and with China leading a global resources hunt that is pushing all acquisition prices up, the next bid is unlikely to be lower than the ones being discussed today
THE graphic above shows how the global financial crisis bypassed Australia.
It is part of a bullish Goldman Sachs JBWere survey of the rebounding Australian economy and sharemarket â€” JBWere predicts that the Australian economy will grow by 3.7 per cent this calendar year and that the S&P/ASX 200 Index will be at 5710 points by the end of the year â€” and it shows the return on equity the big four local banks have generated in the past two decades.
Note that by comparison with the early '90s, the recent global crisis was a cakewalk for them. Two of the four, Westpac and ANZ, saw their return on equity go deeply negative then, as they booked losses on loans to property developers and takeover merchants in the early '90s. The other two banks, NAB and Commonwealth, were not hit as hard, but the four as a whole posted a negative ROE at the nadir of the '90s slump.
The 2007-09 crisis, in contrast, only pushed bank returns gently down: the banks took some heavy hits early as the first wave of corporate collapses occurred, but, unlike the early '90s, the big corporate crashes did not usher in a recession and ballooning bad loans right across their lending books. And the banks not only passed on rate rises as the recovery began but added some of their own, further shoring up their profits.
The economic story behind this graph in the past two years is one of markedly and unexpectedly lower bankruptcies, foreclosures and defaults compared with the early '90s, and the mild ROE downturn is already becoming history.
The banks should be back to their long-term average returns by the end of next year.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,2,"Australia's competition watchdog has cleared Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina's multi-billion-dollar joint takeover bid for coal seam gas (CSG) producer Arrow Energy Ltd.
The revised proposal is part of Shell's plans to substantially increase its CSG-to-liquefied natural gas (LNG) production in the Asia Pacific region.
 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement on its website on Wednesday that it was  not opposed  to the proposed acquisition because the gas was largely export-bound rather than being sold to domestic customers.
 The ACCC considered that the proposed acquisition was unlikely to substantially lessen competition in any relevant market,  the ACCC said.
Arrow has advised its shareholders to accept the offer, which values the target at $3.5 billion or $4.70 per share.
If approved by the Foreign Investments Review Board and Arrow shareholders at meetings in July, Shell and PetroChina will own Arrow's CSG assets and domestic power business as well as its $2.2 billion Fisherman's Landing CSG-to-LNG project in Queensland.
Shares in Arrow were up five cents at $51.6 at 1529 AEST.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Petroleum yesterday insisted its planned $30 billion Browse gas project in Western Australia remained on track despite a warning by federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson that wrangling among indigenous groups could lead to legal challenges and delays.
Mr Ferguson said the timeline to establish a liquefied natural gas precinct at James Price Point, 60km north of Broome, would ``probably blow out'' after a bitter split last week between native title claimants who support the project and those who oppose it.
 The plan for Woodside to convert a heads of agreement with Kimberley traditional owners into a binding indigenous land use agreement by June was unlikely to be met, he said.
The schism among native title claimants has led to speculation that West Australian premier Colin Barnett may move to compulsorily acquire the land to give the project certainty.
That process could take as little as six months, whereas a legal battle between indigenous groups over native title could drag on for years.
Woodside said its aim of reaching a final investment decision on Browse within two years would not be affected by the latest problems.
``While recent uncertainty surrounding the native title claim over James Price Point is disappointing, we do not expect it to have an impact on the overall schedule for the Browse LNG development,'' Woodside said.
``Woodside remains committed to the heads of agreement negotiated with traditional owners for a development at James Price Point and we look forward to the benefits from this agreement flowing to local indigenous people. The Browse LNG development remains on track for a final investment decision to be taken by mid-2012.''
Woodside has already overcome strong opposition from some its Browse joint venture partners to the use of James Price Point for the plant.
The Browse plant would process gas from the offshore Browse Basin gasfields being developed by a Woodside-led consortium that includes BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron and Shell.
The potential delays to Browse come as Woodside encounters strong resistance from the East Timorese government over its plans to develop the Greater Sunrise field in the Timor Sea.
East Timor said this week it would reject any attempt by Woodside and its partners to develop the project in Darwin or through floating LNG facilities.
Asked about the Browse project on a trip to Broome yesterday, Mr Ferguson said he was confident all parties would be able to resolve their disputes.
``I think the intent of all parties is to continue negotiations in good faith,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"THE Federal Government yesterday said it would fund research to help government and mining companies better manage the risks to ground and surface water systems from coal seam gas mining.
US, European and Asian energy giants, along with their Australian partners, are moving closer to making final investment decisions on multi-billion-dollar plans that would bring a massive mining expansion to Queensland's Surat and Bowen basins.
 Coal seam gas mining involves vast quantities of water being brought to the surface to release trapped CSG.
Farmers and local landholders heavily reliant on groundwater want a thorough investigation of potential water risks before the CSG industry ramps up.
Yesterday, Federal Water Minister Senator Penny Wong and Queensland Water Minister Stephen Robertson said up to $3.88 million in new funding would be put toward ``assisting the CSG industry to better manage the risks to ground and surface water associated with its mining activities''.
Mr Robertson said the State Government would work closely with the CSG industry and scientific experts ``to build on our current knowledge''.
Mr Robertson's department last year delivered a submission to a Senate environment committee inquiry into mining impacts on the Murray-Darling Basin, which produces a third of Australia's food and includes the Surat Basin.
``There are concerns about the impacts that extensive dewatering of coal seams may have on groundwater reserves,'' the submission said.
But it said adequate knowledge and data to enable proper assessment of potential groundwater impacts from the CSG industry were ``not available because there has not been a need for it''.
``As a result, it is not possible for the risks to groundwater to be assessed fully in advance of development.''
The Senate committee's final report stated the scientific knowledge of mining's impacts on groundwater resources was so lacking it ``can make it hard to know whether (regulatory compliance) is actually protecting water resources and water quality within the Murray-Darling Basin''.
The Federal Government is yet to respond to the report.
It recommended the Federal Government worked to ensure the prevention of new mines or extractive industries in the Murray-Darling Basin if impacts on water resources conflicted with MDB management plans.
It recommended state governments not release further mineral exploration permits until regional water plans were established.
Ian Burnett, water policy spokesman for AgForce, yesterday said: ``We welcome the input of funds into this research but we're disappointed it's taken so long.
``We believe the cumulative effect of this extraction of water from the aquifer should be well studied before it takes place. And there's as yet been no work done on that.''
Farmers fear if the Great Artesian Basin was seriously damaged, it could take hundreds of years to replenish.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"An emerging rivalry between conventional and unconventional energy producers appears to have sparked a move by the Australian Securities Exchange to overhaul reporting requirements for oil and gas companies.
Energy executives told The Australian Financial Review that rising concerns over the credibility of coal-seam gas reserve estimates have created tension within the industry over reporting requirements.
 In March, Chinese energy companies committed nearly $100 billion in investment to import liquefied natural gas from two planned Queensland based coal-seam gas reserve projects, despite the early stage of development of the industry.
Unlike minerals companies, petroleum companies are not required to have their reserve calculations prepared by a qualified expert.
The AFR revealed yesterday that the Australian Securities Exchange is planning a sweeping overhaul of reporting requirements for oil and gas companies to increase transparency in the booming industry.
Independent oil and gas producer Beach Energy said uncertainty over how to record gas reserves gives companies more discretion in what to tell investors.
 I am not certain the same commercial tests are applied to booking coal-seam gas reserves as have been traditionally done with conventional gas reserves,  said Beach Energy's chief executive, Hector Gordon.
Beach was an early entrant in the Queensland coal-seam gas sector, eventually selling its stake in the Tipton West field last year for up to $400 million in cash, shares and milestone payments.
 There used to be a fairly strong commerciality test and that seems to have become more flexible with time,  Mr Gordon said.
Critics say the existing rules governing the reporting of petroleum reserves to the sharemarket are vague, allowing companies to potentially overstate their reserves and mislead investors.
Mr Gordon said the amount of coverage and investment dedicated to the coal-seam gas sector had highlighted to the overall industry the importance of implementing a common set of standards.
 At times there seem to be two different sets of rules and we would like to see a level playing field,  Mr Gordon said.
 The uncertainty on how you book resources reserves and in particular gas reserves without gas contracts is one of the things we would like to see tightened up. 
But NSW coal-seam gas explorer Eastern Star Gas said the conventional side of the energy industry lacks understanding about the industry.
 They [CSG reserves] are so large that it's hard for some companies and some groups to get their heads around how real the numbers may be,  said Eastern Star's managing director, David Casey.
 I don't doubt there's scepticism and the coal-seam gas industry needs to genuinely deliver. But there's no doubt in my mind the numbers are real. 
Mr Casey said the reserves certification is  identical  for both conventional and unconventional gas reserves.
 If the certifiers are not deemed to be independent and if their numbers are for whatever reason discounted by those that rely on them, then it won't be too long until they're not used anymore. 
Industry experts said smaller energy companies might oppose new reporting rules because of the expense of complying with them, but others say the mining industry has adapted to clear guidelines with little trouble.
Stock exchanges and regulators across the world started enforcing standards for reporting mining discoveries following exploration scandals in the 1980s and 1990s, yet there has been a lag in imposing similar standards for the oil and gas industry.
The US-based Society of Petroleum Engineers, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission has developed comprehensive guidelines covering petroleum reserves calculations but companies are not required to adopt their rules.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"BRAZIL'S national oil company, Petrobras, has joined the hunt for the next round of liquefied natural gas export projects in waters off Western Australia.
Its entry is through a big-spending farm-in deal with the Melbourne-based MEO Australia on the highly rated WA-360-P exploration permit in the Carnarvon Basin.
 The deal is the first time Petrobras has become involved in Australian oil and gas and comes as overseas competition for potential long-term energy sources in Australia heats up, with China, India and Japan in the thick of things.
If discoveries are made in initial wells in the permit, Petrobras could spend as much as $US235.5 million ($A254.2 million) to maintain a 50 per cent equity in the permit, reducing MEO to a carried 20 per cent and leaving Cue Energy and Moby Oil & Gas with their current 15 per cent stakes. MEO shares closed 9Â¢ higher at 45.5Â¢, a gain of 24.6 per cent. Cue and Moby enjoyed some rub-off effect, rising 10.6 per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively.
The MEO deal has been a long time in the making, with MEO last year inviting participation by a major oil company with deep pockets.
A feature of the deal is that MEO will receive a cash bonus of $US31.5 million and receive $US7.5 million in reimbursement of its past costs in the permit on the deal when Petrobras gets the necessary government approvals.
Petrobras will fund 100 per cent of the first well in the permit (Artemis) up to a cap of $US41 million. In the event of a discovery, Petrobras will carry MEO's share of the cost to drill and test two follow-up wells to a cap of $US62 million each, as well as paying MEO another cash bonus of $US31.5 million.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Huge amounts of brackish water can cause problems for projects but there are solutions, writes Paul Garvey.
Australia's burgeoning coal-seam gas industry is set to inundate portions of Queensland with vast volumes of water. The coal-seam gas operations proposed by the likes of Santos, Origin Energy and England's BG Group are set to bring to the surface up to 420 megalitres of mostly brackish water every day, forcing the companies to put in place exhaustive water management systems.
 The volume of water expected each day is only slightly less than the entire average daily water consumption of Brisbane, leaving the companies involved with a huge logistical challenge.
The water issue has been known for years, but the reality is looming larger than ever. Both Santos and BG expect to receive approval for their environmental impact statements in the coming weeks, milestones that will clear the way for the companies to approve their multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas developments.
Origin Energy and its partner ConocoPhillips have lodged their statement and are confident of the approval of their Australia Pacific LNG venture by December 31.
According to the environmental impact statements prepared by the various parties, Santos expects to produce just under 90 megalitres of water a day while BG is estimating 160 megalitres and Origin-Conoco 170 megalitres.
Complicating matters for the companies is an edict from the Queensland government forbidding them from simply evaporating the water off through huge ponds.
The water will come from thousands of coal-seam gas wells spread throughout the Surat and Bowen basins of south-east Queensland, concentrated around rural towns such as Dalby, Roma and Chinchilla. While the water could provide a new level of certainty for water supplies for many of the region's agriculturalists, there are also fears the process could affect existing ground water supplies or pollute waterways.
The Western Downs Alliance has sprung up to represent locals concerned about the environmental impact, and has been campaigning about the potential impact on important aquifers in the region.
Tobie Welgemoed spent seven years working for international engineering group MWH on the treatment and processing of water from coal-seam gas fields in Wyoming and Texas in the United States, and has relocated to Queensland to head up MWH's growing presence in Australia's coal-seam gas industry.
 A lot of farmers are concerned,  Mr Welgemoed said.
 They can understand that the water pumped out can be brackish, so it can't directly be reused, but they're concerned that it can draw down the water table and the fresh water may seep into the bad stuff. 
He says the issue can be easily stabilised by reinjecting water into the seams once the gas has been extracted.
 Once everybody's educated in that, then those fears should go away,  he said.
Water extraction is integral to unlocking the riches of coal-seam gas. The coal seams targeted are tightly packed with both water and gas, and the water must be extracted first to ease pressure in the seams and allow the gas to flow to the surface.
Origin Energy chief executive Grant King said the company had had water management at the forefront of its mind since its earliest days in coal-seam gas.
 One of the very first things we did was set to work on reverse osmosis, to ensure that water could be upgraded to potable standard,  Mr King said.
 Almost hand in hand with our first wells we were running water treatment pilots and we have developed, and our standard plan includes, reverse osmosis. 
Mr King is hopeful that the water can be used for agriculture in the region.  Water in regional economies is a very important issue and we've always had a strategy of making sure we produced potable water,  he said.
Santos, meanwhile, has purchased the freehold land rights over some of its most prolific acreage and is spending $50 million planting 2 million Chinchilla hardwood gum trees.
The Chinchilla gums are particularly tolerant to the brackish water the fields will produce, and Santos ultimately expects to plant up to 6 million trees as part of its operations.
Santos says the program will cost about half of what it would cost to build an equivalent reverse osmosis plant, while the trees could later be harvested or used for carbon sequestration.
Chief executive David Knox says the company will also use reverse osmosis elsewhere in its fields, with the saline, briny byproduct to be reinjected into the coal seams.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"Western Downs Allianceâ€™s Michael Bretherick has slammed Mayor Ray Brown following the 60 Minutesâ€™ co-ordinated coal seam gas (CSG) meeting in Chinchilla on Thursday night, but believes the meeting was a positive one overall.
â€œThe mayor stood up at the meeting and gave us the company line: told us weâ€™d expect to have to hurt a bit to have televisions and air conditioning,â€? Michael said.
 â€œHe (Cr Brown) couldnâ€™t answer any questions that I asked him about Queensland Gas Company dumping contaminated water.
â€œHe looked very uncomfortable and said QGC had apologised; as a community we were not looking for an apology.
â€œI was more than disappointed with the mayorâ€™s performance, but generally speaking the meeting was really good.
â€œThe gas companies didnâ€™t show at Thursdayâ€™s meeting so therefore they would not avail themselves to answer any questions.
â€œThere were heaps of people including farmers who were representative of thousands of people Iâ€™d say.
â€œThere will be political pressure on the Federal and the State governments as a result of this meeting.
â€œThe turn out showed there are a whole lot of people hurting and a whole lot of people really concerned about this and a whole lot people who are being really badly treated by the gas companies.
â€œThe crowd also showed why Western Downs Alliance has grown from a few concerned people and a NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) last year into an international movement.
â€œYou just need to see who we are: we are families with children.â€?
But while Councillor Charlene Hall agrees with Mr Bretherickâ€™s assessment that the meeting will place pressure on the State Government to control the industry more tightly, she has come out in favour of Cr Brown.
â€œI went to the meeting to represent and support the community, itâ€™s a big issue for us all and there were people from all across the Western Downs,â€? Cr Hall said.
â€œWe do require a closer level of input from the state.
â€œWe need people on the ground to experience the issues that our community are experiencing first hand.
â€œI also felt it was important to support Ray, he was big enough to turn up and answer those questions, hard questions that probably shouldâ€™ve been answered by the State and the CSG companies themselves.
â€œHe copped a fair bit of anger from the community which shouldâ€™ve rested on the State Government as far as legislature and the companies as far as the way they treat our residents.
â€œAt the end of the day, as a council we cannot regulate the coal seam gas industry, but it is our role to advocate the State for a more managed approach to the development of this new industry.
â€œThis is a new industry and it offers a lot of opportunity, but it also has a lot of issues that require closer monitoring.
â€œThe meeting was a really good opportunity for people from all over the region and really diverse groups to have a say and express their concerns, and by the end of it, we realised that a lot of us were on the same page with what we need.
â€œWhich was one thing: more involvement from the state and more ownership of its decisions.
â€œHopefully 60 Minutes is responsible enough to send this message across to the state.â€?
I was more than disappointed with the mayorâ€™s performance.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"TWO Brisbane executives who've recently made a poultice from the coal and coal seam gas sectors, Brian Flannery and Richard Cottee, are out to do it again.
Mr Flannery, chief executive of Felix Resources, which was recently taken over by China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co, is off to White Energy - hoping to apply White's coal briquetting technology to some low-grade coal assets in South Australia that were spun out of Felix.
 And Mr Cottee, who led Queensland Gas Company's growth from 2000, as a $20 million dollar minnow, to its $5.7 billion takeover by the UK's BG Group last year, has signed on as chief executive of Nexus Energy.
Nexus is a traditional oil and gas explorer, rather than a CSG player. It has a small cashflow-producing interest in Bass Strait, but a potentially much more lucrative position in the adjacent Shell-operated Libra field and Nexus-operated Crux gas and condensate discoveries in the Browse Basin off Western Australia.
There's enormous competition in the Browse to find ways to commercialise a number of large gas fields.
``What I have to do,'' Mr Cottee told The Courier-Mail yesterday, ``is to come up with a win-win plan to put to Shell to take Crux forward.''
Nexus said yesterday that Mr Cottee, who left QGC with some $30 million, would get ``a market base salary'' but his overall remuneration would be based on ``performance-based long-term and short-term incentives''.
Mr Flannery and then Felix chairman Travers Duncan - who will also chair White Energy - received $530 million each from the sale of Felix, following a courtship with Yanzhou that lasted many months after being dragged out by the global financial crisis.
Yesterday, White Energy's shares soared 22 per cent or nearly 59 to $3.29 after it agreed to buy South Australia Coal, controlled mainly by Mr Flannery and Mr Duncan and fellow former Felix directors. Mr Flannery is expected to become the group's CEO in August. Mr Flannery and Mr Duncan and another former Felix director, John Kinghorn, plan to further invest in White through a $75 million placement at $2.50 each, while Hans Mende, another former Felix director and the principal of US private equity investor AMCI, will also invest $19.3 million in the company.
South Australia Coal has a large low-grade coal deposit in SA, which the group hopes will be upgradeable through White's CSIRO-developed briquetting technology into a high-margin export product.

 The channel nine program was filming outside of Chinchilla last week for a segment they are producing on the CSG industry.
The segment is expected to air within the coming weeks.
There were no gas or State Government representation at the public meeting.
Landowners, environmentalists, solicitors, politicians and group chairmen did attend and an array of issues were raised.
These included salt and water management, environmental impacts, infrastructure and green gases.
Many pointed the finger at the State Government with its lack of answers and control over the gas companies leaving the residents feeling helpless and unsure about future resources and infrastructure.
Western Downs Regional mayor Ray Brown, along with some local residents, expressed concerns that the meeting could have had a detrimental impact on the town if a balanced and fair approach was not taken.
After the meeting, Cr Brown said he was very pleased with the response from the community and whilst it was not balanced, the residents showed respect and their comments were knowledgeable.
He said the meeting highlighted that â€œan enormous juggernaut was coming to usâ€? and fast, and that the region needed help from State and Federal governments.
Meanwhile Member for Maranoa Bruce Scott said it re-enforced the fact that an act of parliament needed to be created that prescribed the responsibilities of mining.
He said the government was using environmental and State planning laws to handle the CSG industry, which is not dealing with the coal seam methane developments.
He thanked 60 Minutes for speaking with the community and giving a public face to the concerns of the community through its program.
Meanwhile, former Greens Party spokesman, social activist and environmentalist Drew Hutton has vowed to fight these issues head on by forming a coalition of groups.
This week Mr Hutton announced he would resign from his position with the Greens so he could focus solely on bringing these issues and concerns to the broader Queensland region.
Mr Hutton, was born and raised in Chinchilla, and has said the CSG industry will be the biggest environmental issue ever seen in this country.
He is urging all those concerned including landowner groups, agricultural land groups and local businesses to join forces and work as one.
â€œDevelop an umbrella organisation that speaks with one voice,â€? he said.
â€œWe can pool resources and lobby; this way we canâ€™t be divided.
â€œThereâ€™s one way to win and that is to run a strong campaign; we wonâ€™t do it by being polite.â€?
He said to date the response from local groups had been excellent and he planned to meet with them in the very near future.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"A Texas power company owned by Macquarie Group is suing the United States Environmental Protection Agency for taking too long in granting a permit for the development of a  state of the art  natural gas-fired power plant.
Documents filed by the plaintiff, Avenal Power Center, in the US District Court for the District of Columbia allege that the suit is a  citizen suit  under the Clean Air Act against the EPA and an EPA administrator  for their failure to perform a mandatory duty required by the act .
 The filing said that since August 2007 Avenal had been working with the EPA to secure a  prevention of significant deterioration  permit for the 600-megawatt power plant in CaliÂ­fornia. Such permits ensure air quality standards are maintained and emissions can be controlled.
Avenal said it had already accepted the permit conditions and the EPA notified the company in writing on March 19, 2008, that the application was complete.
The complaint cites a clause under the Clean Air Act that the EPA is required to take final action within one year, which indicated March 19, 2009, was the deadline.
 Defendants' failure to comply with their mandatory duty has had, and will continue to have, substantial adverse economic impacts on Â­[Avenal],  the filing said, without quantifying the amount.
In a December document notifying the EPA of its intention to sue, the plaintiff's lawyer said:  From the very beginning, Avenal Power has made it clear that time was of the essence because of financial commitments.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"BHP BILLITON Energy
The expanded North-West Shelf liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia has finally hit its straps, helping BHP Billiton's petroleum division to a production record.
 Some 18Â months after a fifth train, or processing facility, was commissioned at the site, the project posted a quarterly production high.
The North-West Shelf is the largest resources project in Australia, contributing 1Â per cent of the nation's gross domestic product and generating more than $1Â billion a year in government royalties.
Teething problems with the newest train, followed by major maintenance at older trains, meant the expanded North-West Shelf had failed to deliver on its increased capacity since the fifth train began producing LNG in September 2008.
Yesterday, BHP said its 16.67Â per cent stake in the project had yielded 35.3Â billion cubic feet of natural gas in the March quarter, up 4Â per cent from the December quarter and up 11.7Â per cent from a year ago.
The figure is a record for the project, which is jointly owned by BHP, Woodside Petroleum, BP, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan Australia LNG.
The early performance of train five was dogged by reliability problems, prompting a costly overhaul.
While the issues at train five have largely been resolved since mid-2009, scheduled maintenance elsewhere on the North-West Shelf meant the project had struggled to meet its full capacity before the March quarter.
BHP's overall petroleum division produced the equivalent of 36.8Â million barrels of oil for the March quarter, up 16Â per cent from the year before. Production in the past nine months, of 116.4Â million barrels, was up 17Â per cent year on year.
Natural declines in production from BHP's oil projects were partially offset by the company's new $US1.6Â billion ($1.7Â billion) Pyrenees project in Australia, which began production in late February.
Meanwhile, BHP yesterday said the schedule and budget at it and ExxonMobil's $US1.25Â billion Turrum development in Bass Strait off Victoria was under review.
The potential cost blowout at the project echoed BHP's announcement in January that the schedule and budget of the ExxonMobil-led Kipper project, also in the Bass Strait, were being revisited.
The two projects, which are expected to cost about $3Â billion, are predicted to collectively produce 21,000 barrels a day of condensate and 280Â million cubic feet of gas a day when production starts next year.
"
AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Woodside said, in a statement to the Australian stock exchange, that the fall in production was due to a 46-day maintenance outage at its Stybarrow field, the sale of its Otway assets, off the Victorian coast, and a natural decline in production at Stybarrow, Enfield and Neptune.
 This was partially offset by record quarterly (liquefied natural gas) LNG production from the North West Shelf Venture,  Woodside said.
 The fall in sales revenue was attributed to the same reasons as the fall in production.
But compared to the prior corresponding period in 2009, sales revenue was up 43 per cent, largely as a result of improved commodity prices, Woodside said.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,2,"MARK COLVIN: Given our massive exports of iron, coal and natural gas, Australia has few relationships more important than that with China. But it's a changing relationship and unpredictable because of growing Chinese power and the way that that's changing other relationships, especially with the United States.
A Cambridge University academic, Stefan Halper, has written a book called The Beijing Consensus. It argues that China's pursuit of its interests, particularly in securing access to raw materials, is changing the international landscape.
 This is particularly because he says China's foreign policy is almost entirely economically driven rather than guided by values.
I asked him how the Beijing Consensus was challenging what's been known as the Washington Consensus which has held sway since the fall of communism.
STEFAN HALPER: Well, it's the failure of the Washington Consensus that has left the door wide open for the Chinese to march through. I mean the Washington Consensus was the idea that funds would be available from the World Bank and the IMF, provided that countries engaged in certain important reforms.
That they provided health and education, that they didn't spend unreasonably on government buildings, that the money that flowed through was for the purposes so stated and there was transparency ensconced. That was the Washington Consensus.
Now after a decade of this in the eighties, it became clear that many countries actually still had high rates of infant mortality and low rates of literacy and they hadn't made very much progress. And, of course, the reason was, was very poor follow up, bad monitoring, took forever to get these loans out the door of the IMF.
The Bank of China walked in, started doing them in one tenth the time and without any interference in the internal affairs of these countries about things like human rights, good governance, transparency. The Chinese do not ask those questions.
MARK COLVIN: And in return all they had to do was promise essentially not to recognise Taiwan and a couple of other things?
STEFAN HALPER: Yeah, they had a very small menu. One of them was don't recognise Taiwan, another was don't receive the Dalai Lama. You side with China on human rights issues in the UN. They had to support China on the South China Sea issues.
And, finally, there was a WTO issue where they forced countries to declare that China was a market economy and that would then lessen fines levied by the WTO if China was found to be dumping. And other than that, our countries were pretty well left alone.
MARK COLVIN: Australia is in this peculiar position where we are very heavily dependent now on trade, on our export industries, trade with China. And so we're very heavily dependent on Chinese growth and yet we are politically a very strong ally of the United States.
Where does all this leave us?
STEFAN HALPER: Well, it leaves you in a bit of a quandary. I mean I have to say that right up front. It's no surprise that you find yourself relying upon China for the markets. There is a, I mean it is after all an enormous market and you have resources that they want and they will play that. I mean we saw how they, how they managed to play these issues in Australia.
On the political side, I would like to see an arrangement in which Australia, India, Japan and perhaps other parts of South East Asia drew together to try to ensure, not to contain China but rather to simply remind China that the sea lines of communication have to remain open; that the South China Sea is not a Chinese lake and that all of us have to cooperate on resources in the sea bed, the sea lanes, environmental questions, non proliferation questions.
MARK COLVIN: Given China's enormous and growing power, how likely is it that those countries will do that?
STEFAN HALPER: Well, I don't know but I think that when they think about it carefully they'll realise that if they don't pull together, if Australia, India and Japan don't pull together, they will be picked off individually. And this is going to come down to various forms of confrontation.
MARK COLVIN: People are talking about a demographic crisis for China, sometime in the next 15, 20 years; nothing can go on growing forever. When do you think the bubble will burst?
STEFAN HALPER: Well, you know this- the one child policy's turned out to be a nightmare. Some areas of China there are 20 per cent more young men between the ages of 19 and 24 than there are women. That has all kinds of reverberating problems. Not to mention the fact that there aren't enough young people to support this ageing population. I mean, or there won't be, as you say, in the next 10 or 15 years.
I don't know quite how that works out. I mean I think that China's not alone in this. Japan's got a similar problem. One thing that we have seen in some economies which are pressured is that productivity has increased through technology.
It may be that the Chinese invest heavily in technology that enhances productivity which in turns enhances product. There is no clear answer to this. They're working on it. They don't know quite where they're going with it. But you can see every year, as I say, increases in productivity technology.
MARK COLVIN: In another way of putting the question, I suppose, is how long will the Beijing Consensus rule?
STEFAN HALPER: What worries me is that these are values of convenience. They're values that rulers across the world beyond the West happily embrace and they deny the principles that have informed western progress for two or three centuries.
I don't know how long this authoritarian phase will last. The Chinese are heavily invested in this idea. I mean, for example, just take one more second to say, last January, a year ago January, the Chinese started a global information campaign. They invested $6.6 billion because they believed that it's not whose army wins, it's whose story wins. And they want to control or frame the stories that emerge in the global information space.
So they've got 56 languages for television, print and so on. They are trying to tell their story and the, express the virtues of their system with every resource they have. And I sort of feel as though the two systems are moving towards what, I don't know what else to call it, a kind of battle of ideas about governance.
It's just very hard to know how long these things last or where they end up. But I don't see any way to avoid some form of confrontation.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE massive ramp-up planned in Queensland coal seam gas production to feed Gladstone liquefied natural gas plants could face delays as key players look to develop acreage the state's coalminers also have their eyes on.
It is believed miners, including BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale, have raised concerns over the potential for drawn-out disputes over exploration tenements they share with CSG producers, who want to drill hundreds of wells on the ground to source their gas.
 Coal seam gas producer Arrow Energy has also called for improvements to the current legislation, which was designed to deal with a small domestic Queensland gas industry, not the thousands of production wells that will be required to produce LNG exports planned from Gladstone.
Under Queensland's legislation, ground can be explored by both miners and CSG producers at the same time. When it is time to convert it to production leases overlapping claims are subject to negotiation between CSG and mining companies.
If this is unsuccessful, the Queensland government will have to make a ruling. The government has not been placed in this position yet, but as applications to reserve ground for gas production gather pace, disputes are more likely.
``Coal seam gas is in areas which coalminers are now starting to look at opening up, because the global financial crisis has passed and metallurgical coal prices are moving up,'' said Paul Newman, head of energy at law firm Blake Dawson.
``From our perspective, there is a regime that will come under pressure from this process.
``There is uncertainty about what the government will do.''
Early plans by Xstrata for a massive 100 million tonnes a year coal province near Wandoan in the Surat Basin is also expected to spur other miners with overlapping CSG exploration tenements. In a recent tenement overlap dispute between CSG producers and the small underground coal gasification sector, the Queensland government ruled on the side of the CSG producers. It is hard to see state government, which collects royalties from the world's biggest coking coal export industry, siding so quickly with the CSG industry if the coal industry moved against it.
The four plants planned for Gladstone harbour are aiming to produce more than 12 million tonnes a year of LNG by 2015, though industry watchers say this target is unlikely to met.
Arrow Energy, the subject of a takeover bid from Shell and PetroChina, said the existing legislation had worked well in the past in its dealing with coalminers, but could be improved.
``The existing Petroleum and Gas Act and Mineral Resources Act provisions were designed in the infancy of the coal seam gas industry,'' an Arrow spokesman said. ``Opportunities exist for the legislation to better reflect the needs of the emerging CSG to LNG industry.''
Allens Arthur Robinson partner Ben Zillman said: ``The question might be not about the legislation, but whether the administration of the legislation can cope with the sheer volume of issues it might have to deal with.''
Queensland Resources Minister Stephen Robertson, BHP and Vale were not prepared to comment on the issue yesterday. A spokesman for the Queensland Resources Council, which represents petroleum companies and miners, said the issue had not been raised by its members.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"COAL seam gas minnow Icon Energy - which took the market by surprise earlier this month when it announced a memorandum of understanding with a potential Chinese buyer for billions of dollars' worth of LNG - got a good roll-up at its annual meeting on the Gold Coast yesterday.
But the 117-member turnout, which chief executive Ray James said ``was very good for us'', was not about to rubber stamp all resolutions that were put to the meeting.
 A resolution to increase the pool of available directors' fees - from $250,000 to $750,000 - was knocked back.
Mr James said later it had not been intended to share the higher amount among current directors, but that the increase was designed to allow Icon to increase the breadth of expertise on its board as it grew.
Mr James was denied an issue of 1.42 million shares, said by the board to be a reward for past performance and an incentive to keep up the good work in future.
However, Ray McNamara, Icon's chief financial officer and company secretary, got his promised bonus, of just over 605,000 shares. These won't vest unless Icon's market capitalisation rises to $300 million, from about $150 million at present, by the end of May next year.
Mr James conceded there was some scepticism about Icon's tentative Chinese deal which was, he said, consummated after the bonuses were proposed.
Mr James pointed out that, not so long ago, Queensland's bigger CSG players, which have all signed multi-billion deals with energy industry majors in the past two years, were regarded as curiosities.
And, he said, he believed Icon, with CSG acreage in Queensland and potential coal and shale gas areas in South Australia, would be able to prove up the reserves to turn its MOU into a firm sales agreement.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,2,"Trucks and Rigs A Herald advertising feature
AUSTRALIAN truck market leader Isuzu Trucks has enhanced its range with the recent release of four ultra-low-emission N and F Series CNG (compressed natural gas)-powered trucks, providing environmentally conscious buyers with a true alternative to diesel fuel.
 Isuzu Motors Ltd (Japan) pioneered compressed natural gas vehicles in the early 1990s and commands about a 70 per cent share of Japan's commercial CNG vehicle market.
The latest generation of Isuzu CNG trucks comprises the NLR 200 CNG, NPR 300 CNG, FSR 700 CNG and FSR 850 CNG models, offering comparable performance to that of their diesel counterparts while delivering reduced exhaust emissions, most notably harmful particulate matter (PM), which is zero in the new vehicles.
A further benefit of the Isuzu CNG range is lower running costs due to more stable natural gas pricing and the ability to enter into a long-term contract with a local supplier for better balance sheet control.
Isuzu Australia Limited (IAL) product planning and engineering support manager Colin White says the new Isuzu CNG models offer an excellent balance of power, refinement and environmental performance.
 These models even meet some performance criteria under proposed EURO VI standards, for which an introduction date is yet to be finalised for Australia. Overall, the CNG engines provide greenhouse gas reductions in the order of 15 to 30 per cent - and these are conservative figures,  Mr White said.
The 4.5-tonne GVM NLR 200 CNG and seven-tonne GVM NPR 300 CNG share the naturally aspirated 4570cc, four-cylinder CNG 130 engine, which features multi-point injection to produce 96 kW of power at 3200 rpm and peak torque of 353 Nm at a diesel-like 1400 rpm.
Although the performance numbers are a little less when compared to a diesel engine of the same size, the CNG engine has a wider operating range, which allows lower gearing to compensate for the slightly lower torque.
Both models are fitted with Isuzu's popular AMT, the five-speed variant in the NLR 200 and the six-speed in the NPR 300.
Also common to both models are two 150-litre steel CNG tanks offering a range of more than 300 kilometres on a combined urban/highway cycle, loaded to full GVM.
The natural gas is stored at up to 200 bar in the high-pressure cylinders, which have safety lock-off valves and a pressure regulator system to supply fuel to the engine system at four bar.
Both models also feature an idle stop fuel-saving system, which turns the engine off at idle once the AMT selector has been placed in neutral and the park brake engaged.
Once the driver reselects drive, the engine automatically restarts. The idle stop fuel-saving system can be engaged and disengaged via a dash-mounted button.
The N Series CNG models offer the same safety features and cabin appointments as their diesel-powered variants. This includes seats with pretensioning seatbelts and driver's SRS airbag in both models. The NPR 300 is also equipped with a passenger airbag.
There is also an anti-lock braking system with electronic brakeforce distribution.
Keeping the ride smooth and supple are double-acting hydraulic shock absorbers front and rear, while the NLR 200 also features independent front coil suspension for more car-like handling and comfort.
In the medium-duty market, Isuzu offers the FSR 700 and FSR 850 CNG models with respective GVM of 12 and 14 tonnes. These vehicles are powered by the CNG 220 engine, a 7790cc multi-point injected, six-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled unit producing 162 kW of power at 2400 rpm and 735 Nm of torque at 1400 rpm. This torque output is greater than that of its diesel equivalent in conventional FSR 700 and FSR 850 models.
The engine is mated to Isuzu's six-speed MZW-6P manual transmission with air-assisted shift and synchromesh on gears two to six.
The trucks are fitted with a single 150-litre carbon fibre-wrapped aluminium tank, two 100-litre steel tanks and an additional 90-litre steel tank for a total fuel capacity of 440 litres, which provides a combined-cycle driving range of about 400 kilometres.
Safety is also a strong suit of the F Series CNG range with standard equipment including a driver's SRS airbag, seatbelt pretensioners, anti-lock brakes and hill-start aid.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"The natural gas sector, fuelled by coal seam discoveries and projects such as Gorgon, is set to earn $50 billion in exports
THE nation is preparing itself for a gas export bonanza, fuelled by growing energy demand from China and India, that could see Australia increase its liquefied natural gas export revenue seven-fold to $50 billion a year, at today's prices, over the next 20 years.
 The boom in demand for natural gas from Asia, and the development of a new source of supply in the coal seams of Queensland's Surat and Bowen basins, has been rapid, and has sent expectations of LNG export revenue soaring.
The combination of booming demand and new supply has driven a number of corporate takeovers as international and local resources giants take out Queensland juniors such as Queensland Gas and Arrow Energy, and jostle for position in the race to produce gas exports from both sides of the country.
Illustrating the speed of the turnaround, little more than three years ago ExxonMobil, Oil Search and Santos were planning to import gas to Australia from Papua New Guinea through a 3800km pipeline to fill an expected local shortfall in supply.
However, that plan was axed in 2007 in favour of a liquefied natural gas export plant, based on the sudden emergence of coal seam gas as a new Australian domestic supply source, along with the strength of the growing Asian demand for LNG.
The joint venture partners last month approved a $US15bn ($16.2bn) plan to freeze the gas from the Southern Highlands of PNG at a plant in Port Moresby and then ship it to Asia as LNG.
While there have long been a number of LNG projects planned around the massive gas fields of offshore Western Australia, the rapid switch in the PNG project to a gas export operation is being matched by a series of rapid-fire plans from international gas giants to export the CSG reserves of Queensland.
``Over the past two years there has been a global boom in unconventional gas, which includes coal seam gas,'' says Grahame Bethune, chief executive of Perth oil and gas consultants EnergyQuest.
``People had been concerned about there not being enough eastern states gas for domestic purposes, but then it turned out there would be a big excess,'' he said.
``Nobody rang a bell or cut a ribbon to say we would have this revolution -- it just crept up on everyone.''
It appears the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the extra supply coal seam gas will put into global markets are yet to cause serious concerns about an LNG glut from the new supply source.
Traditional big buyers such as Japan and South Korea continue to try to shore up their LNG supplies, while China and India are also increasing consumption. There is a growing preference for LNG over big gas pipelines due to the ability to have a greater number of potential suppliers.
LNG is natural gas frozen to 1/600th of its size so it can be transported in tankers, rather than sent through pipelines.
Global majors continue to clamour for Australian gas resources on the east and west coasts as they talk up the nation's resource developments.
Despite the global financial crisis, some of the biggest export deals in Australia, worth up to $50bn, have been signed in recent months.
According to Deutsche Bank, there are 13 new Australian LNG projects at various stages of development, with a total cost of over $220bn, scheduled to start producing by 2018.
They have a combined capacity of 90 million tonnes a year of LNG.
Four planned projects in Queensland -- where three years ago no one had announced they were looking at exporting gas -- make up about a quarter of the value and production of the LNG projects.
To put the ambitions of the players in perspective, Australia, after nearly 30 years of LNG production, currently has just two LNG projects, producing a combined total of about 19 million tonnes a year. Government forecaster the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics is not expecting all of that production to come on line by 2018.
But it is predicting all, or their equivalent production, will be on line by 2030, spurred by growing Indian and Chinese demand.
Based on average expected Australian prices of about $420 a tonne, the 119 million tonnes of LNG production forecast would bring in about $50bn a year.
The six-fold rise in Australian production would compare to a trebling in global LNG demand in the same period that is forecast by oil giant Exxon Mobil, representing huge growth in Australian market share. Even if global gas prices do not rise, the $50bn revenue estimate is conservative. This is because revenues from the North West Shelf project, which exports about 16 million tonnes of LNG a year, are weighed down by cheap legacy contracts signed with China when demand was not so hot.
This is not expected to be the case with future production.
For comparison, iron ore, currently Australia's most valuable export product, is tipped to bring in $29bn of revenue this year.
ABARE'S mid-term forecast for LNG revenue predicts 25 per cent a year growth in revenue to 2014-15, when LNG exports are forecast to be $13.5bn, up from $7.2bn forecast for this financial year. The increase in export earnings reflects the growth of export volumes and projected higher oil prices over the course of the next several years.
One reason ABARE, along with almost every other forecaster, does not believe everything will come on line on target is the sheer inability of the nation's construction industry and bureaucracy to pass all the projects.
This has led to a certain sense of urgency in getting projects to more advanced stages, despite objections from some of the developers to portrayal of an LNG race.
``It is a race -- those who say it isn't are in a situation where they risk things getting more difficult for them,'' says UBS oil and gas analyst Gordon Ramsay.
``There are aggressive timetables out there that won't be met, just because there is not the manpower and equipment or the ability to get approvals through,'' he said.
New projects, such as the four LNG projects involving plans to export Queensland's CSG from Gladstone, also need to be seen as first movers to attract buyers.
This is evidenced by British giant BG, which Ramsay sees as the Queensland leader despite rival Santos being slightly ahead in the approvals process.
BG has secured the first binding contract, with China, and also has offtake deals with Chinese, Singapore and Chilean buyers.
Santos has only been able to secure an offtake deal with its 40 per cent joint venture partner Petronas, despite months of talks with potential buyers.
The biggest LNG project being planned (and also the biggest development of any sort in Australia) is the long-contemplated $50 billion Gorgon project on Western Australia's Barrow Island, which was given board approval by owners Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell late last year.
It is expected to produce15 million tonnes of LNG a year, valued at $7 billion based on Australia's current prices by 2018.
Gorgon shows why new entrants are feeling a sense of urgency. LNG plants offers better returns when production units, or trains, are added.
Continued on Page 2
Continued from Page 1
This means to expand the massive Gorgon project, which sits on massive gas reserves, will cost a lot less than its start-up.
According to ABARE forecasts, the regular Asian buyers -- Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- are expected to buy more LNG as their economies pick up after the global financial crisis. China and India will be important sources of new growth.
Global demand may grow from 178 million tonnes a year now to about 220 million tonnes a year by 2015, ABARE says. Latin America could be another source of growth. ``Concerns about the security of natural gas supply, including the nationalisation of the energy sector in Bolivia, have spurred development of LNG re-gasification terminals in the region,'' ABARE says. ``Besides Argentina, which started to import LNG in late 2008, a number of countries -- including Brazil and Chile -- are expected to start importing LNG during the outlook period (2014-15).''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE liquefied natural gas market may be going through an unprecedented boom, but the role of natural gas in the domestic energy sector remains uncertain.
In Australia, gas accounts for about 20 per cent of the overall energy mix, including transport, but only about 9-10 per cent of the stationary energy market.
 How it competes in the future energy mix, particularly for stationary energy, will be largely influenced by government policy.
The major domestic gas suppliers argue that gas should be playing a pivotal role in the energy mix, at the very least as a transitional fuel to help efforts to transform Australia to a low-carbon economy.
According to the International Energy Agency, natural gas has about half the greenhouse signature of coal (and as little as a third of brown coal), and offers energy efficiency and ease of use.
Australian suppliers say meeting the nation's short-term emissions reduction target will be impossible without increased use of gas-fired generators.
But gas is more expensive than coal and its ability to compete on price with coal is largely dependent on a carbon price. And there is little prospect of having a carbon price any time soon or the policy settings that could encourage long-term investment decisions.
In the international sector, the role of gas seems assured.
The IEA predicts growth in Asia, the primary market for Australian LNG exports of 3.2 per cent per annum.
Santos chief executive John Knox reckons that under-estimates the potential of natural gas in Asia. ``You can't address greenhouse gas emissions without addressing the role of cleaner burning fuels in generating this electricity,'' he says.
``So when you look at Australia at around 9 per cent, India at 8 per cent and China at less than 1 per cent, one realises there is plenty of room for gas to penetrate the market, particularly if the world is serious about climate change.''
And, says Knox, every 1 per cent increase in the share of gas of the overall energy mix in non-OECD Asia equates to 45 million tonnes per annum of LNG in 2030 -- the equivalent of three projects the size of Gorgon.
``Any policy shift towards lower emissions would sharply accelerate the growth outlook for natural gas,'' Knox says.
``I would argue that this policy shift will happen. The question is when and at what rate. When it happens it will drive significant fuel switching.''
However, it is the shape of policies that will likely drive the extent and the type of gas-generating facilities in Australia. This was highlighted in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia this month by Origin Energy chief executive Grant King, who highlighted the contradictory effects of an incomplete portfolio of climate change policies.
King argues that renewable energy resources, with the exception of wind, are not yet ready to bear the burden of a switch to low-emissions energy production, or even to meet Australia's two targets for 2020 -- a 20 per cent share for renewable energy and a 5 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 levels.
He, like others in the industry, argues that gas is the logical choice as a transitional fuel that can help cut Australia's emissions, particularly with options such as nuclear, or carbon capture and storage, at least 20 years away because of a mixture of political, technological and cost issues.
He says emerging renewables such as geothermal and solar that might offer large-scale energy supplies in the future are also at least a decade away.
However, large, baseload combined-cycle gas generators are unlikely to be built without a carbon price narrowing the cost gap with coal, or, as Santos suggests, a low-emissions target to supplement the RET.
Instead, open-cycle gas generators, a rapid response but a higher cost energy source designed to meet sudden surges of demand in peak periods, are likely to be needed to balance out the intermittent nature of wind, which is expected to meet nearly all the RET.
Over the longer term, the future of gas as a fuel is likely to be decided by the severity of long-term emissions reduction targets, which seem to average between 80 and 90 per cent by 2050 -- and the success in developing effective carbon capture and storage technologies.
By then, gas is likely to face competition from other renewable sources, particularly geothermal in Australia, where vast resources of cost-competitive zero-emissions baseload power could emerge as the biggest displacement threat for fossil fuels.
However, European countries are mandating market share for energy sources such as offshore wind, wave and tidal to reduce the reliance on imported gas and enhance energy security.
It remains to be seen if Australia chooses to follow that path.
Still, gas may emerge as a key partner in the development of emerging fuels such as solar, acting either as a ``booster'' for large-scale solar thermal power stations, or indeed the reverse.
The Queensland government, for instance, has been mulling proposals to install a solar booster at the Kogan Creek power station.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"NATURAL gas has come of age, says George Kirkland. What was once a second prize to explorers seeking oil is now a premium commodity.
Kirkland is executive vice-president for upstream and gas of Chevron Corporation, operator of the new icon of Australian energy development, the Gorgon natural gas project.
 Based today in San Ramon, California, across the bay from San Francisco, his company got its start in 1879 with an oil discovery near Los Angeles. This business was absorbed into John D. Rockefeller's oil empire and became Standard Oil of California in 1911 as a result of the famous forced break-up of Rockefeller's operations. Its launching pad to super-stardom in the petroleum business was the 1950s discovery of the world's largest oilfield, Ghawar in Saudi Arabia.
After a half-century whirligig of corporate deals, including a 1984 marriage with Gulf Oil that was the largest merger in US history at the time, then acquisition of Texaco in 2001 and Unocal in 2005, Chevron is now one of the world's six ``super-major'' petroleum businesses, active in more than 180 countries and engaged in petroleum exploration, production, refining, marketing and transport, as well as chemicals manufacture and power generation. Chevron is also the world's largest producer of geothermal energy.
It outlays $US300 million a year pursuing technologies for alternative energy, including fuel cells, photovoltaics, hydrogen batteries and hydrogen for transport and power supply.
In its pantheon of wealth generation, gas is starting to play a very special part as world energy dynamics change to cope with the need to decarbonise.
``Chevron believes in natural gas,'' says Kirkland. ``We are confident that it will redefine the world's energy equation in this century. It will have a large role in our future. We have 150 trillion cubic feet of un-risked gas located throughout the world. Our holdings in the Asia-Pacific region are the largest in our competitor group.'' ven for this huge company, 150tcf is a helluva lot of resource -- a trillion cubic feet of gas is equivalent to 80 million barrels of oil.
The importance of the Gorgon development is that it contains 40tcf of gas shared between three partners -- Chevron (50 per cent), ExxonMobil and Shell (each 25 per cent). Together they are exploiting a project with enough energy to power Adelaide for 800 years. It is the largest development in Chevron's 100-year history --``a legacy project,'' says Kirkland, ``a long-term growth engine with prime access to the entire Asia-Pacific market''.
When the go-ahead for the project was announced last year, Chevron said that, with an estimated economic life of at least 40 years, Gorgon would be a major contributor to the company's future growth. Last month, looking at the company's prospects, chairman John Watson noted that Chevron expected a substantial production increase mid-decade as its portfolio of investments shifted towards natural gas and Asia.
Past exploration success, as Kirkland explained to the most recent World Gas Congress in Buenos Aires, is enabling Chevron to ride the strong momentum the global gas industry has built up over the past decade, including development of LNG, gas-to-liquids and long-distance pipeline projects. Over the past 10 years the company's reserve replacement has exceeded 100 per cent of production.
Gorgon is not the company's only LNG development in Australia. Next in line will be Wheatstone, able to export 4.3 million tonnes of gas a year, compared with Gorgon's initial capacity of 15 million tonnes.
In pursuing its gas agenda, Kirkland says, Chevron is driven by three critical factors.
First, development costs must continue to be pushed down because the world has a lot of natural gas. Hopefully, successful marketing will offer customers good prices.
Second, in order to maintain the confidence of host governments and communities, developers must display ``superior project execution'', the ability to operate in a safe, reliable and economically and environmentally responsible way.
Third, companies must continuously have the long term in mind, working with governments to ensure that investment conditions are stable, predictable and ``reasonable''. Chevron needs investment environments where taxes, fiscal regimes, regulatory structures and sanctity of contracts fit together in the right way.
``The development of energy,'' Kirkland adds, ``should benefit everybody who is involved: our shareholders, our employees, customers and suppliers, our partners and the countries and communities where the resources are found.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"WEST Australian Premier Colin Barnett's smile was as wide as the Cheshire Cat's on the day the $50 billion Gorgon gas deal with China was signed last August, and he's been smiling a lot ever since.
A clear signal the country was emerging from the global financial crisis, the deal was the biggest of several huge LNG developments in WA that led the Premier to proclaim the state was ``becoming the Saudi Arabia of natural gas''.
 These projects have helped push WA's expected growth rate to 6 per cent per annum by 2012-13, giving Barnett plenty to smile about.
However, there are storm clouds on the horizon too, in the form of skills shortages and infrastructure deficiencies that are presenting challenges to government and industry as they seek to maximise growth.
WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy Infrastructure and Economics director Paul Frewer believes part of the problem is that the rapid pace of the upturn, fuelled by projects such as Gorgon, has left little breathing space.
``We've had a pretty strong decline and a very quick rebound,'' he says. ``With such a rapid upturn and commitments to very large projects like Gorgon, there's been little time to deal with legacy problems from the last boom, certainly in the Pilbara. We had expected the focus to be on things like land, housing, accommodation and other infrastructure, but we've already got takeoff occurring in the next boom.''
A shortage of accommodation has seen property prices rocket, and rents in the Pilbara can be as high as $3000 a week.
With the population expected to increase by 40 per cent, or 17,000 people, in the next five years, the shortage will intensify.
``There's an unprecedented number of projects in the Pilbara at the moment that are taking off together, so the cumulative demand for accommodation is very strong at present,'' Mr Frewer says.
LNG projects typically comprise a large fly-in, fly-out workforce whose accommodation needs are different from residential workers.
``Part of the problem is that planners don't consider that fly-in, fly-out workers require services and accommodation and land, whereas they do,'' Mr Frewer says. ``So it's really important that any future fly-in, fly-out requirements are brought into planning and modelling so that these components are incorporated into broader community development and townsite development.''
The WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes more should be done to attract a permanent workforce to the Pilbara.
``If we were able to build more liveable regional communities with basic infrastructure, like housing, education and health facilities, then it might be a more attractive destination for families,'' CCI chief economist John Nicolaou says.
The WA government is aware of the problems, and last November unveiled its Pilbara Cities initiative to develop towns in the region. One of its first projects is the construction of a 100-home village for service workers in Karratha where rents are anticipated to be about $350-$400 a week, less than a quarter of what private renters pay. More land releases are planned for residential estates, and the WA government is also seeking Infrastructure Australia funding for regional airport upgrades, wastewater services and other essential infrastructure to improve services in the Pilbara.
A recently completed report by the CME found infrastructure bottlenecks were emerging as a significant issue in WA.
``Because of the growth that's occurring across the board, port capacity, for example, is a very real issue,'' Mr Frewer says. ``Access to existing ports like Port Hedland is problematic and although expansions are planned it's a very long process. We've looked at things like the supply of water, energy and transport across each of the regions and what we've found is that these are all emerging as real constraints on future development.''
Another potential inhibitor to growth in the LNG sector is the skills shortage and the difficulty of attracting workers to remote parts of WA. ``The government is placing a lot of emphasis on skills training, but there's still going to be a shortage, especially in oil and gas where there are very specialised skills required,'' Mr Frewer says.
``Specialists in this field work on projects all over the world and competition for skilled labour is going to extremely high.''
The CCI is particularly concerned about the flow-on effects of the skills shortage on other industries. ``Labour shortages are the single greatest challenge facing the WA economy at the moment and the single biggest issue that could limit the growth potential of the state,'' Mr Nicolaou says.
The chamber estimates WA will need an extra 400,000 workers in the next seven years and is calling on the federal and state governments to outline a strategy to address the shortage.
``It's a really worrying trend in WA that we've suddenly gone from low-cost jurisdiction overall -- in relation to labour costs, in relation to housing -- to a very expensive jurisdiction where we now have the highest labour costs of anywhere in Australia and have amongst the highest priced housing in Australia as well,'' Mr Nicolaou says. ``Labour shortages drive up wages and while the resources industry will inevitably have the capacity to pay higher wages, service industries don't.
``These industries are really the backbone of society, things like retail, hospitality, aged care, health and community services, but they don't have the capacity to pay and they're the ones that really do suffer in periods of acute labour shortages.''
The CCI believes the federal government needs to significantly increase its permanent migration program and create flexibility in the temporary migration program to account for cyclical peaks in resources activity.
Encouraging greater workforce participation, particularly among women, indigenous people, older people and those with disabilities, would also help the skills shortage, the chamber believes.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"The emirate is leading the world in technology to harvest and distribute liquefied natural gas
QATAR is the mouse that roared in the global upstream petroleum industry.
 The little emirate squeezed between Saudi Arabia and the waters of the Persian Gulf earns half its GDP from oil and gas, and has the second biggest per capita income in the world behind Liechtenstein.
With a population smaller than Adelaide's, more than half of them foreigners, it dominates the LNG trade.
Fishing and pearl hunting were all the Qataris could rely on for income until the 1940s discovery of the Arabian Peninsula's massive petroleum resources.
But even when the emirate began to earn large revenue from selling oil, its people didn't benefit because of the wasteful ways of its leader.
That changed in 1995 when the current emir overthrew his father in a bloodless coup and now its residents enjoy all the amenities of a modern state. Qatar sees itself today as a role model for economic and social transformation in the Middle East and is bidding to host an Olympic Games this decade in Doha Sports City.
The powerhouse of Qatar's fortunes is the gigantic North Field straddling the marine border with Iran, which makes it the Saudi Arabia of natural gas.
North Field holds the gas equivalent of at least 6 billion barrels of oil and possibly 10 times as much.
When Queen Elizabeth went to Milford Haven's harbour in South Wales this time last year with Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, it marked a crowning achievement for Qatar -- launching delivery of LNG in a new-style ship from two of the largest export gas plants ever built -- to reinforce its status as the leader of the globe's seaborne gas trade.
The Welsh terminal, jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum, ExxonMobil and France's Total, is now part of a supply chain based on the most advanced technology and economies of scale achieved in the LNG business.
Manufacture and transportation of LNG is expensive and producers need to drive down their costs to win and retain customers.
The new ships, with capacities up to 80 per cent more than vessels from the 1980s, have slashed transport costs by 30 per cent.
The chain's starting point off Qatar is one of the world's largest gasfields, with reserves exceeded only by fields in Russia and Iran.
Its twin trains are each the size of a large oil refinery, with total capacity of 15.6 million tonnes a year, and the joint venture has built 14 of the largest LNG tankers to make 14-day runs over 6000 nautical miles from the Middle East to Wales, where the terminal has five of the world's biggest storage tanks.
The technology used on the project is now driving LNG developments worldwide.
The Qatar government's partnership with major petroleum companies has delivered results that ExxonMobil acknowledges were hardly conceivable a little more than a decade ago.
In the 1970s Qatar, while doing well from selling oil, struggled to find a way of exploiting its gas reserves because they were so far from the world's power plants and main industrial markets.
It took 26 years for the first LNG venture to be commissioned, in 1997, and another nine year to drive up capacity to 28 million tonnes annually.
Today a series of capital projects, including the world's first offshore terminal in the Adriatic Sea on the northeast coast of Italy, and the supply chain ending in South Wales, have created an export business selling 77 million tonnes of LNG a year, equivalent to 25 billion barrels of oil.
By the end of this decade Qatar is expected to be despatching up to 85 million tonnes a year of LNG to the global market from 17 huge trains. The progress in Qatar has neighbouring Iran worried, partly because Teheran's inexperience in the industry and US sanctions have made development and marketing difficult, and partly because Iran fears that the speed and extent of tapping of the giant Qatari North Field is affecting reserves in its South Pars Field.
Geologically, the fields are linked.
In the Qatari capital, Doha, this alarm is dismissed as political posturing, but Iranian experts claim they can prove that their neighbour's rapid developments are making their gas more difficult to extract.
Qatar's progress in winning a large share of the world market also sends ripples to Australia, for which it is a strong competitor, to India, where the government is anxious to capture sufficient supplies to fuel its fast-growing economy but concerned that it does not lock itself into expensive contracts if there is going to be a gas glut this decade, and to Singapore, where the service sector, which has developed one of the world's leading shipbuilding and repair centres, sees Doha as offering a strong opportunity for new income.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"The vast and largely untapped gas resources of PNG are beckoning players big and small.
NOT one but two, and possibly three (or four) -- that's the outlook for the number of liquefied natural gas plants in Papua New Guinea.
 With LNG set to provide about 15 per cent of the world's energy needs in coming years, the vast and largely untapped gas resources of PNG are beckoning players big and small.
It is also potentially a transforming event for PNG, where four out of five households live on less than $US1 a day.
Some describe Australia as the ``Saudi Arabia of LNG'', but our northern neighbour may well become the Kuwait of this new energy industry.
No sooner had the go-ahead been given for ExxonMobil's project -- the biggest single development in PNG history -- than potential partners began lining up to get aboard the second project, with India's state-owned gas player GAIL saying it had approached Interoil, the leader of the second consortium, for a stake. It has been reported that China National Offshore Oil and PNG-owned Petromin PNG Holdings are also on board with Interoil. But, for the moment, all eyes are on ExxonMobil's project.
The company, operating through its subsidiary Esso Highlands, has finalised contracts for all the planned LNG output of its plant. The integrated development features gas production and processing plants in two provinces, Southern Highlands and Western, as well as liquefaction and storage capacity for 6.6 million tonnes a year located northwest of Port Moresby on the Gulf of Papua. More than 700km of pipelines will connect gas production at Juha and Hides with the LNG plant.
Partnering ExxonMobil are two Australian-listed companies, Oil Search with a 29 per cent stake and Santos with 13.5 per cent. PNG corporations and Nippon Oil make up the rest of the consortium.
All up, the project will cost $US15 billion and, over its 30-year life, the scheme will see the production of more than 9 trillion cubic feet of gas. Construction work will begin this year, with first production in 2014.
The LNG output will be shared by four main customers: Taiwan's CPC Corp, Osaka Gas Co, the Tokyo Electric Power Co and a subsidiary of China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (known as Sinopec).
The LNG plant will have a substantial impact on the PNG economy.
It will triple the country's exports and double the PNG gross domestic product ( at present $US8.2bn a year).
Over the life of the project it is expected that 60,000 landowners will share about $US7bn in royalties.
However, in a wider context, the LNG plant may be the biggest single boost to the country's economy, but it is only one of several resources projects that are transforming or will transform the financial structure of PNG.
The giant Ramu nickel-cobalt mine has been built by a Chinese corporation, and other big resources exploration projects are well under way.
PNG's huge gas potential has been known for many years, but the commercial exploitation of the gas has been possible only with the advent of LNG and the soaring demand for that form of energy in Asia. The domestic market could never have provided enough justification for development.
The two LNG projects may not be the end of that story.
Talisman Energy, a Canadian-listed company, owns the offshore Pandora gas field in the Gulf of Papua.
It had intended to sell Pandora, but as the offers were considered ridiculously low, Talisman bought British-listed Rift Oil to increase its offshore acreage, and now sees itself as the third LNG player in PNG.
South Africa's Sasol Petroleum has also taken up several licences and set its sights on becoming an LNG producer in the country.
Then there is Vancouver's LNG Energy, which has begun exploration. It, too, wants to be part of the PNG LNG scene.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"GLOBAL finance house Merrill Lynch says the previously forecast level of oversupply of liquefied natural gas globally may not now occur, and that there is now a more positive view on demand.
According to Bloomberg, Merrill analysts believe LNG imports worldwide could increase by as much as 22 per cent this year due to the recovering world economy, especially with rising demand from Japan and South Korea.
 LNG imports increased just 4.4 per cent in 2009.
They now expect the world to absorb 4.9 billion cubic feet a day of the chilled gas. But there would still be some oversupply in 2010, with only 89 per cent of LNG production capacity being used.
BRITISH trade magazine The Motorship says the huge demand for ships to transport liquefied natural gas has led two Chinese shipbuilders, Dalian Shipbuilding Industry and Jiangsu Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group, to join the LNG carrier market.
The magazine says the sector will need 38 bulk carriers this year and by 2015 will require another 65 of these massive vessels.
The magazine says that Chinese shipbuilders will be able to use credit lines from domestic banks to finance the ships.
ExxonMobil, for example, is leasing six LNG carriers from Mitsui OSK shipping line.
One Chinese shipyard, Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding, is now designing LNG carriers with a capacity of seven million cubic feet.
The shipyard is at present building an LNG carrier to be used on the Malaysia-Shanghai route.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE vast majority of Australians are just starting to come to terms with the potential of the coal-seam gas industry.
While its transition from an underground coalmining hazard to major export industry is a work in progress, the confidence with which international energy companies are moving towards their LNG goals augurs well for Queensland and Australia.
 Awaiting final investment decisions are proposals totalling about $58 billion. These are linked to more than 15,000 construction jobs and upwards of 5000 operational positions from the gas fields of the Surat and Bowen basins to LNG processing facilities at the coastal city of Gladstone.
In the wake of long-term purchase announcements with major customers in China, Japan and Malaysia, it is instructive to reflect on the recent history of coal-seam gas, and the challenges and opportunities arising from its spectacular arrival on the energy scene.
Just over a decade ago the methane trapped in deep coal seams was perceived as a bit player in Queensland's energy market.
The state government's mandated 13 per cent gas share for electricity generation in 2000 was focused on supporting a natural gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea, but coal-seam gas developers wasted little time in taking up the invitation.
By September 2006, with coal-seam gas locked into major gas-fired generation projects, the PNG pipeline was officially placed on hold.
Major energy companies soon began taking an interest in the gas-producing potential of stranded coal deposits. These deposits are now poised to supply the world's first coal-seam gas to the export LNG industry and adaptations such as underground coal gasification and coal-to-liquids processing.
Coal's ability to provide feedstock for liquid fuel production is particularly significant with Australia facing a $25bn a year import bill by 2015.
One of the first domestic spin-offs in this category is a long-term supply agreement for an interstate network of LNG filling stations.
These will provide the trucking industry with the equivalent of 70,000 litres of diesel a day.
The challenges in delivering a CSG-LNG export industry are substantial, but not insurmountable. There is concerted industry and government efforts to ensure the most effective management and utilisation of the gas.
Two other live policy issues may also determine how quickly Queensland can realise an export LNG industry.
Increased gas exploration has brought some landholders into contact with resource explorers for the first time.
Interest groups have been effective in channelling private anxiety into political agitation, with two key state policy announcements including standard land access agreements and a statement of intent to protect Queensland's best-quality, or ``strategic'', cropping land.
At one level, such intent maintains the status quo. Resource operations have a legal obligation to rehabilitate land back to a defined standard and a ``born-again'' policy should not apply to exploration activities.
Of course, the elephant in the room is the issue of skilled employees to service a new regionally-based export industry. While LNG projects in Western Australia are naturally attracting the attention of the National Resource Sector Employment Taskforce, Queensland's demands can't be overlooked.
The state government also needs to establish an independent statutory skills commission to ensure an industry-led approach to satisfying skill needs in the economy.
Serious questions surround the vocational education and training system's ability to meet the gas industry's demand for technical skills. These were outlined in an Energy Skills Queensland report. It forecasts that by 2015, with six LNG trains in operation, the industry will need:
* Nearly 1500 drilling technicians
* More than 200 electrical technicians
* 300 diesel fitters and related mechanical trades and
* More than 1000 process plant operators.
Those with long memories may recall that these are the jobs described some 20 years ago as servicing Australia's sunset industries.
The sun is about to rise on Queensland again.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"Queensland is ready to ride the LNG wave, but questions are emerging about labour shortages
A SUPPLY and demand graph tells the story: In fiscal year 1997-98, every cubic foot of gas consumed in Queensland came from conventional natural gas wells, but by 2009 about 65 per cent of the state's gas was produced by drilling into coal seams.
 The first coal-seam gas started being sent down the pipelines in 1999, and took only nine years for it to gain more than 50 per cent of the Queensland gas market.
But even by then, in 2008, there was hardly consensus on just how big a role coal-seam gas was going to play.
``Coal-seam gas is either a bubble or a boom, depending on who you talk to,'' began a story that year in this newspaper.
And this despite the fact that there was already talk of three liquefied natural gas plants being built at Gladstone. But this development alone had already altered the investment landscape so far as coal-seam gas was concerned, with the sector undergoing a re-rating. By 2009, CSG stocks were starting to soar.
By 2010, there are few doubts about the future of this industry.
Some coal-seam gas stocks started early. Queensland Gas, taken over by Britain's BG International last year, saw its share price double between 2005 and 2006, making the company worth $460 million. Then the shares went from 92c to a high of $6.22.
Arrow Energy also saw its worth multiply many times as its Queensland coal-seam gas story kept getting bigger. By the time Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina made their bid for the company earlier this year, the Arrow price tag was $3.5 billion.
But not only is Australia riding on the coal seam's back, as it were, a few others are.
When you take conventional gas reserves, Australia is relatively small beer with 89 trillion cubic feet.
Compare that with Russia's 1529 trillion cubic feet and Iran's 1045 trillion.
But, according to BP's data, only two countries register with unconventional gas sources -- the US with 580 trillion cubic feet and Australia with 250 trillion cubic feet, nearly three times greater than our natural gas resources. Given the amount of exploration now under way for coal-seam gas, that unconventional gas figure for Australia has got a long way to grow.
However, there is another factor to consider in regard to Australia's coal-seam gas.
In a recent speech, Santos chief executive David Knox argued that this country and the US are unusual, in that they have large gas reserves that are accessible to global investors, unlike Russia (just ask BP about that, its wrangle with a Russian joint venture partner becoming so heavy that the top BP man on the project went into hiding), Qatar or Iran.
In fact, even the countries in the next tier of natural gas plays are fraught with their own difficulties -- Venezuela, China, Algeria and Nigeria, for example.
In a nutshell, the already large coal-seam gas resource in Queensland, plus the easy access for foreign players, explains why the state is in gas overdrive.
Even before the first sod is turned on any of the proposed LNG plants, Queensland is already feeling the economic surge from the coal-seam gas industry.
That, combined with the robust coalmining industry, has meant that unemployment in the Surat Basin is roughly a quarter the national average.
Therein lies a problem. A study released by the Queensland state government projected that the LNG developments would create about 18,000 job vacancies, many of them for skilled workers. That could be a modest estimate. Origin Energy says it might need 18,600 extra people between 2012 and 2015.
So far as the Queensland coal-seam gas sector is concerned, it has already been feeling the skills crunch.
With figures such as 55,000 new jobs over the coming decade for Queensland's petroleum and gas sector, the potential for shortages of the right workers assumes potentially nightmarish proportions. Premier Anna Bligh in March announced her government would put up $10 million to help train people in new skills needed in the coal-gas industry.
Most geologists, mining engineers and technical services managers in Australia have traditionally worked in the metals sector, but quite a different set of skills is needed to classify gas in coal seams, and deal with saturation and permeability of the gas.
And there are downsides as well. The coal-seam gas story in Queensland is not all big smiles and bright sunshine.
Environmental and farming groups have been raising concerns about the knock-on effects of drilling possibly as many as 20,000 wells across producing farm land, concerns that include the incidental elevation of salt levels and the impact on underground drinking water supplies.
Gladstone Mayor George Creed has been reported as being concerned about the effects of the city becoming even more of a boom town. He says the local hospital and infrastructure are already being taxed to their limits. And well-known independent energy analyst Peter Strachan has warned that the coal-seam gas frenzy might have one other consequence -- a gas glut, with some of the upcoming producers receiving low prices for their production.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"BEFORE it was taken over by British group BP International last year, small junior explorer Pure Energy was hot on the trail of coal-seam gas in Tasmania.
And another small company, Westralian Oil & Gas, is trying to get a coal-seam gas story going southwest of Busselton in Western Australia.
 While the big players have been focusing on Queensland, and the prospect of coal-seam gas developments there fuelling a new and enormous liquefied natural gas industry at Gladstone, other companies are fanning out across Australia to size up any known occurrences of coal, and assessing the prospects for being able to drill them for the gas trapped in their seams.
The coal has been known about for decades.
Only in recent years, though, has the coal been seen as a potentially enormous source of commercial gas.
In the case of Westralian's project near Busselton, the company became interested in the area after hearing local landowners tell of gas being found when BHP drilled there for coal in the 1970s.
Eventually the 1974 BHP report on the drilling was found, confirming that gas under pressure had been experienced.
In contrast to what is emerging as the main game in Queensland, much of the activity in other parts of Australia is aimed at fixing domestic energy blank spots.
The Pure Energy story made sense because, at present, Tasmania imports its gas from Victoria.
South Australia is facing a more immediate problem: the natural gas being pumped from the southern Cooper Basin is close to half of what it was in 1999, and the state's electricity demand is rising, driven partly by several large mining project developments.
Strike Energy is aiming to fill the breach and will be drilling the southern Cooper this year to test the coal-seam gas potential.
If the company is successful, the Moomba to Adelaide gas pipeline is already in place.
The Simpson Desert may not seem the most obvious place for coal-seam gas production, but Central Petroleum is hot on the trail, drilling CSG wells in part of the Pedirka Basin.
The company believes there could be as much as a trillion tonnes of coal under the red centre which could support both coal-seam gas and underground coal gasification production.
The company's most recent presentation shows the existing and proposed LNG plants in Australia, all of them in either the Northern Territory, Western Australia or Queensland.
Then, in a lighter shade, the map includes a possible pipeline to Darwin from the Simpson Desert and the caption ``CTP-LNG?'', CTP being Central Petroleum's ticker code on the Australian Securities Exchange.
But outside Queensland, undoubtedly the other big coal-seam gas player is NSW.
Just after Easter, Arrow Energy and partner Apollo Gas announced that early stage work had confirmed gas just 15km north of Newcastle.
The formations consisted of shale and sandstone as well as coal, but it was just another sign that NSW is still on the early stage of the coal-seam gas exploration curve.
One of the wells, for example, went down 750m and intersected 18 coal seams, with the companies saying that preliminary tests showed these seams had high gas content.
Among the more established players is Eastern Star Gas, which has been drilling coal seams near Narrabri. Unlike the early stage explorers, this company has a known resource -- its latest estimate of reserves total 1520 petajoules.
Gas is now being piped to its Wilga Park power station, which will eventually have a capacity to generate 40 megawatts of electricity. Power is already being sold into the national electricity market.
Eastern Star is looking at all the options -- LNG production at Newcastle, methanol and more electricity projects.
Also very much in the NSW coal-seam gas picture are Metgasco and Red Sky Energy.
Metgasco is working on the Clarence Moreton Basin in northern NSW, an extension of Queensland's Surat Basin. Red Sky, while working hard in Queensland, has also been locking up ground in NSW.
Its strategy is to find acreage the big players overlooked and then try to interest potential global partners that have yet to enter the Australian market.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ALONG with Queensland Gas Corporation, Arrow Energy played the major role in taking Queensland's vast coal-seam gas (CSG) resources from a waste disposal problem to a viable source of LNG.
Arrow's 2009 deal with Shell -- like QGC's tie-up with BG (which took it over in 2008) and Santos's with Malaysia's Petronas -- showed the market that turning CSG to LNG and exporting it was a commercial reality. If it had not been, gas giants such as Shell, Petronas and BG would not have got involved.
 Now, like QGC before it, Arrow is heading into absorption by its partner, with Shell and PetroChina's $3.2 billion bid for the company's Australian CSG assets and reserves (and some power station assets) having been recommended by the Arrow board.
That's not bad for a company that listed in a $5 million float in August 2000.
``It's unfortunate that had the global financial crisis not occurred, we'd probably find that Shell would be paying a lot higher price,'' says Steve Bartrop, managing director of resources at investment group Lime Street Capital.
As well as $4.70 a share, Arrow shareholders will receive one share in a new company, Dart Energy, which has been formed to hold Arrow's international interests in CSG opportunities. The scheme is to be voted on in July and, if approved, completed by August.
Dart Energy, which will list on the Australian Securities Exchange, will contain Arrow International's CSG tenements (Shell still owns 10 per cent) in China, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, plus about $22m worth of Arrow's minority shareholdings in Bow Energy, Apollo Gas and LNG Ltd, plus farm-in rights into Apollo's Gunnedah Basin tenements. Dart will also have an initial cash balance of $45m, and under the terms of the deal, Shell will make a US$25m ($26.8m) loan facility available to Dart, which will fund its first year of operations.
Shell bought into Arrow in February last year, taking a 30 per cent interest in Arrow's CSG acreage in Queensland, as well as a 10 per cent stake in Arrow International. Shell also signed a deal with the Gladstone Ports Corporation giving it an exclusive ``right to investigate'' a site on Curtis Island for a possible LNG plant: the idea was to supply this plant by natural gas from the CSG acreage jointly owned by Shell and Arrow.
Peter Strachan, of Stock Analysis, says Arrow has ``played it well'' and the directors have an ``escape pod'' in the form of Dart. ``They can sell and start again with their interests in Indonesia and India and China. Effectively, if Dart finds gas in China, it will be competing with Shell to try to sell that gas to the same customers; except the management, through Dart, will be producing the gas in China.
``I think that's where I'd rather be, compared to having to pipe it to Gladstone, liquefy it at great expense, ship it across to China at great expense and put it into a storage facility at great expense. If you're actually producing the product in the target markets, whether it's Vietnam or India or China, you're going to be in a strong position.''
Investment bank UBS says defining a value for the international assets in Arrow Energy is difficult. It says Arrow has no booked international CSG reserves or commercial international CSG production, but from a long-term perspective, UBS believes Arrow's international CSG operations are potentially undervalued by the share market.
``From a valuation perspective, it is important to realise the CSG industry is not fully developed in the countries Arrow is operating in (China, Indonesia, Vietnam and India), and in some cases Arrow is the company establishing this industry in the country,'' says UBS. ``In particular, Arrow has previously stated that China has potential to eventually match the size of Arrow's existing Australian domestic coal-seam gas operations (UBS values the Australian domestic CSG assets in Arrow at more than $1 a share). Moreover, if the results delivered by Arrow with its Australian CSG assets -- which showed stellar reserve growth -- are any example of the potential for the international assets, then there remains significant potential for the international assets.''
On this basis, UBS says it is possible a value of more than $1bn could possibly be placed on Arrow International.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"Cost and cleanliness are behind the drive for coal-seam gas, the new boy on the energy block
JUST 20 years ago, the methane gas present in coalmines was an unwanted and dangerous by-product. Now, coal-seam gas supplies about 25 per cent of the eastern Australian gas market.
 Far from being unwanted, it is now considered a particularly clean form of natural gas, with very low carbon dioxide levels. As well as producing clean-burning gas, and water that can be treated to a potable standard, CSG collection leaves the coal seam intact for future extraction.
CSG is now so prominent in Australia's energy mix that it is being proposed as a feedstock for the nation's export success story, LNG.
While large-scale CSG-to-LNG production has not yet been demonstrated in Australia, deals such as Shell's and PetroChina's $3.2 billion bid for Arrow Energy's Australian CSG assets is a vote of confidence that Australia's plentiful supply of natural gas from coal seams is just as viable a source of energy for the growing economies of North Asia as is the conventional LNG industry centred on the North-West Shelf.
That is a remarkable change of status for a commodity that only emerged as a commercial prospect in 2000 when the Queensland government decreed that 15 per cent of the state's electricity supply should come from gas or renewable energy by 2005.
``People knew that CSG was there, but it was always deemed by the true-blue petroleum people -- the Woodsides and so forth -- as being of lower calorific value than gas out of the North-West Shelf,'' says Steve Bartrop, managing director of resources investment group Lime Street Capital. ``Also it wasn't deemed to be there in sufficient quantities to make it a serious threat. But (gas explorer and producer) QGC led the charge, and QGC basically proved that you could get 2P (proved plus probable) independently verified reserves out of CSG, and suddenly the market started to take notice. With 2P reserves, you can develop sales contracts, and when you've got sales contracts you've got revenues, and suddenly you've got earnings and cashflows, and that will get reflected in your share price. So this amazing re-rating -- led by QGC and Arrow -- went through the sector in 2006.''
The big uplift then to the CSG players, says Bartrop, was the fact that LNG was priced not at low domestic prices, but linked to the oil price. ``They were able to break out into a much more lucrative scenario,'' he says. ``When the reserves started increasing, the amount of inferred reserves that one could generate out of acres and acres of Queensland that were marginal coal areas was phenomenal, and suddenly QGC -- and BG with it -- started to think, `we've got enough gas here, we could feed that through to an LNG plant at, say, Gladstone, and then sell it'.''
Independent analyst Peter Strachan, of Stock Analysis, says: ``It is a bit embarrassing for the conventional LNG guys like Don Voelte of Woodside, who have been bagging the CSG projects. They might be just starting to feel that they've missed the boat a little bit. In the fullness of time it may well be revealed that developing CSG is actually lower-cost and lower-risk than developing offshore fields like Browse or a Sunrise.''
Strachan says that in the Bowen-Surat basins, some CSG wells are producing more than two million cubic feet of gas a day. ``That's quite an astounding rate of flow,'' he says. ``The CSG wells on average in the Surat and Bowen basins produce more gas than the conventional wells in the Queensland Surat Basin. That is a bit of a dodgy comparison, because the conventional wells in the Surat Basin are mostly old and in decline, whereas the CSG wells are mostly pretty new and on the way up. But even if you look at the average conventional well in the Queensland Cooper Basin, it produces about 714,000 cubic feet a day, and an average CSG well in Queensland produces about 469,000 cubic feet a day. There's not a huge difference.
``The other thing is that CSG is very scaleable: you can drill 10 wells, it costs you $4 million-$5m to do that, whereas if you drill one well in the Browse Basin somewhere, it's going to cost you $100m, drilled and completed.''
While the conventional resources off the North-West Shelf are massive, and the fields are very long-lived, Strachan says the CSG fields have an advantage when it comes to infrastructure. ``From the Browse field, for example, there is a 350km pipeline to James Price Point, and that's going to cost $600m-$700m, so the upstream infrastructure costs in the offshore gas business are huge. The upstream infrastructure costs in the CSG area are also large, but they're a bit less risky.
``You still might have to put maybe a 600km pipeline in from the CSG field to Gladstone, but you're not doing that along the bottom of the ocean, you're doing it in someone's paddock.''
Now the industry is poised to go to the next step, says Bartrop: underground coal gasification (UCG), which burns coal deep underground to extract a gas -- known as syngas -- that can either be liquefied in a reactor in the gas-to-liquids (GTL) process, to produce diesel and aviation fuel, or fed into an LNG plant.
``UCG takes out 20 times the amount of energy than CSG. With CSG, you drill holes through it, you dewater it, and you get about 5 per cent of the energy of the coal seam. But if you do UCG, you get 95 per cent of the energy out.''
Bartrop says the gas industry is set for a ``very interesting'' few years. ``A lot of the big Queensland gas players like Shell and Origin and Arrow etc all have petroleum licences, but UCG comes under a mining licence. We're not quite sure how Queensland will resolve this, because it's easy to see the situation where you have, say, Origin sitting over a coal-seam reserve, and it wants to take out 5 per cent of the energy, whereas some other party could have the right to the UCG, and take out the remaining 90-95 per cent of the energy.''
Bartrop expects to see ``a lot of developments'' in the UCG area this year. ``There will be some sort of deals done, because at the end of the day, if you're Santos or Origin and you're sitting on all this coal-seam gas, and you've got another company that owns the rights to the energy after you leave, you really need to do some sort of deal where you share that value.''
Leading the group of stocks that will attract interest as UCG gets more widely known, he says, are Linc Energy (LNC), Carbon Energy (CNX), the former Metex Resources, and Cougar Energy (CXY). Linc has built a pilot CTL facility in Chinchilla, Queensland, and plans a 20,000-barrels-a-day commercial plant, a $900m-$1 billion project. Carbon Energy is developing what it calls the ``world's first commercial-scale, oxygen-injected UCG facility'', at Bloodwood Creek in southwest Queensland. Cougar is also seeking joint venture partners in Victoria, where there are very large ``stranded'' brown-coal deposits.
Jeremy Tobias, renewable energy analyst at broking firm BBY, says the UCG/GTL process has the potential to find a use for the millions of tonnes of stranded coal in Australia. ``The term `stranded coal' refers to coal that is too deep or too remote to mine economically and doesn't have the properties of thermal or coking coal, so it's not suitable for use in power generation or steelmaking. These deposits were thought to be useless, but UCG and GTL makes them a valuable future source of energy.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ONE of the companies riding Queensland's coal-seam gas investment wave is Brisbane-based WestSide, which is making the move from gas explorer to producer.
Established five years ago as an unlisted company, WestSide is now engaged in multi-million-dollar deals and is set to play a key role in the emerging LNG industry at Gladstone. It listed on the ASX in January 2007, which was seen as crucial for its growth strategy.
 An important move in making the transition to production has been the $26.8 million acquisition from Anglo American of 51 per cent of the Dawson Seamgas assets in Queensland's Bowen Basin near Moura.
The result will be a joint venture with Japanese trading house Mitsui, which held a 49 per cent stake in the assets and will continue in that position by transferring its interests to LNG arm Mitsui E&P Australia. WestSide will be project developer and operator.
``We negotiated this transaction in the depth of the global financial crisis,'' says WestSide chairman and chief executive Angus Karoll. ``At that time, many companies were trying to consolidate and conserve their cash position, but we believed we would be through the worst of the crisis by the time the deal was closed, and that seems to be how it played out. It was a good buy, even before you consider the value of the infrastructure.''
Two investment vehicles that have been quick to move into the CSG sector have signed up as cornerstone investors. New Hope Corporation and Energy Investment Trust are taking $8.1m in share placements and have agreed to underwrite the company's $56.3m entitlement offer.
The Dawson Seamgas fields are producing about 12 terajoules of gas per day under a supply contract with AGL. The CSG assets include a petroleum lease, gas rights in mining leases, and gas compression and pipeline infrastructure connected to Queensland's gas network. The assets contain about 186 petajoules of proven and probable reserves.
``We will be targeting work programs to increase the field production to 25 TJ/day and further expansion after that,'' says Karoll. ``There is tremendous growth potential as well, and the readiness of major investors to come on board as part of the Dawson Seamgas acquisition is a significant vote of confidence.''
The company's goal is to export LNG and supply new domestic contracts from 2015-16, when the current supply contracts run out.
Karoll notes that WestSide, with an eye to the long term, has not abandoned its exploration work. The company will soon resume drilling activities in its Bowen Basin tenements after a shutdown due to bad weather in the region, with plans for more detailed appraisal of the Paranui and Tilbrook pilot projects.
The Bowen Basin properties have a total of 211 petajoules of proved, probable and possible gas reserves, and there are strong possibilities of additional large reserves.
WestSide also has exploration tenements in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland, seen as highly prospective areas for CSG.
Karoll points to important downstream opportunities, such as using CSG as a transport fuel in the form of compressed natural gas.
``Substituting CNG for diesel alone would generate demand equivalent to approximately 260 PJ of energy a year,'' he says.
``Because of the extent of our uncontracted gas reserves, we can quickly capitalise on emerging possibilities.''
On the global stage, longstanding relationships have provided WestSide with overseas opportunities, especially in Indonesia. The company has established agreements with PT Bumi Resources, Indonesia's leading producer of thermal coal, to scout for possibilities.
WestSide and Bumi have set up a jointly owned company to identify possible CSG resources on the island of Kalimantan, at a coalmine operated by a Bumi subsidiary.
The strategy is to eventually secure tenure over any CSG reserves within Bumi's coal areas, with a view to marketing gas within the region.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"LNG - Basic Facts
* Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is used for transporting natural gas to markets that cannot be reached by pipeline.
 * The gas is extracted from deep underground and despatched to a processing plant where it is purified, removing water, oil, mud, carbon dioxide and other impurities.
* It is then cooled to about minus 162 C, the temperature of the planet Saturn, reducing its volume 615 times - a car reduced this much would fit on your thumbnail.
* The super-cold fuel is stored in cryogenic tanks.
* In its liquid state, the gas is not explosive and cannot burn, allowing it to be shipped safely and efficiently.
* It is transported to market in specially-designed ships with double hulls.
* At its destination, LNG is reheated at purpose-built terminals to return it to its gaseous state for sale to consumers through local pipelines.
* Worldwide, there are now 17 LNG liquefaction export terminals and 40 import terminals, 25 of them in Japan.
Demand for LNG
* A half century ago natural gas was viewed by explorers as a pesky by-product of the search for oil. Now it is one of the most coveted sources of energy in the world.
* As the cleanest burning fossil fuel, natural gas is now in huge demand around the world, playing a vital role in balancing economic growth and the need to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases missions.
* The Paris-based International Energy Agency predicts that global demand for natural gas will grow by more than 67 per cent between now and 2030 as world energy consumption rises by more than 40 per cent.
* With abundant reserves of natural gas offshore and major development of coal seam methane in Queensland over the past eight years, Australia is now in a position to be a world leader in the international gas trade for decades.
North-West Shelf
* The development of the North-West Shelf venture 25 years ago marked the start of a new era for Australia's oil and gas industry.
* With a total capital outlay to date of $27 billion, the Karratha-based project now accounts for 40 per cent of national petroleum production.
* Its five LNG trains are able to deliver more than 16 million tonnes of fuel a year. It has sent more than 2,800 cargoes to customers in Japan, China and South Korea since the first shipment in 1989.
* Woodside Energy, operator of the NWS project, is now developing the Pluto field offshore Karratha, with the first train expected to come online next year, adding another five million tonnes a year to LNG exports.
Australia's rivals
* Despite its successes to date, Australia has yet to achieve LNG dominance in any of its key markets. More than 80 per cent of purchases by Japan, Australia's largest customer, come from other countries - while 98 per cent of South Korea's and 97 per cent of Taiwan's imports are from other nations. China became an Australian customer for liquefied gas in 2007.
* Our major rival suppliers are Indonesia, Malaysia, Qatar, Brunei, Abu Dhabi and Oman.
* Qatar is the world's largest producer, aiming to achieve exports of 77 million tonnes a year in 2010.
* The Australian petroleum industry predicts that maximum development of national gas resources for export could see this country's contribution to world trade increase by 80 million tonnes annually - more than four times today's level - in the next 10 to 15 years, but the new projects will also encounter substantial additional competition from Nigeria and Russia, although Indonesian output is forecast to decline.
* Rising development costs and a projected over-supply of LNG around the world in the short term are hurdles to Australian LNG plans along with ongoing uncertainty about carbon emissions policies.
Gorgon project
* Development of the massive Gorgon LNG project is described by the operator, Chevron Australia, as the modern-day equivalent of the engineering challenges this country faced in building the iconic Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme a half century ago.
* It will be the country's largest single resources project and a world leader in carbon dioxide capture and sequestration technology.
* The gas resource the development is tapping contains enough energy to power a city of a million people for 800 years.
* The fields holding the gas are located 130 to 200 km off the north-west coast of Western Australia.
* They will serve three LNG trains, each capable of five million tonnes annual production, on Barrow Island.
* A 4km long jetty will be built on the island to handle up to three LNG shipments a week.
* About 10,000 people will be employed in building Gorgon at the peak of the construction period.
* Globally, the use of Gorgon gas will enable a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 45 million tonnes a year compared with fuelling power stations with coal. This is equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australian cars off the roads.
Darwin development
* A 502km pipeline that required 160,000 tonnes of steel brings gas from the Baya-Undan field under the Timor Sea to a Darwin liquefaction facility that has one of the world's largest above-ground LNG tanks.
* From there tankers despatch more than three millions tonnes of LNG to Tokyo utilities annually under contracts that expire in 2023.
* The project is strongly multinational, involving the American firm ConocoPhillips, Australia's Santos, Italy's Eni plus Japan's Inpex, Tokyo Electric Power and Tokyo Gas in tapping the resources of an area shared by Australia and Timor Leste.
* The field was discovered in 1995 but its development was long delayed by complex inter-governmental negotiations.
* The agreement between the two countries will see $5 billion flow to the Timorese government over the project's life and $500 million in taxes for Australia.
* The Darwin development has been hailed as changing the economy of the Northern Territory - and Inpex is now investigating the feasibility of piping gas to the NT capital from its Ichthys field via an 850km pipeline. An investment decision is expected this year.
Carbon implications
* Dealing with an LNG development's greenhouse gases is an increasing headache for investors, not least because the emissions are recorded in the country of origin while the gains from the fuel substituting for coal-fired power are recorded in another nation.
* The pain is worse when the producer country embraces carbon charges and the customer nation does not - and when rival producers are based in countries not committed to emissions curbs.
* The petroleum industry estimates that, if all the LNG projects currently proposed go ahead, Australia can contribute to a reduction in global greenhouse gases of 180 million tonnes a year, but the developments will still add to the national tally even when a project like Gorgon undertakes sequestration of 40 per cent of its emissions.
* The Gorgon joint venture plans to outlay $2 billion on a plan to store 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide beneath Barrow Island annually.
Gorgon's past
* Barrow Island, 70km off Western Australia's Pilabara coast and the hub for the Gorgon development, has been a nature reserve for 100 years, but it has also been home to petroleum production for four decades.
* Maintaining the island's treasured environmental status is a major challenge for Chevron Australia and its co-venturers ExxonMobil and Shell.
* The 23,600 hectare island is one of the largest land masses in the world without established introduced animal species and at least 24 of its terrestrial species are found nowhere else.
* It is also an important nesting site for marine turtles.
* Its isolation provides a haven for a range of native species that are rare and endangered on the mainland.
* Rigorous environmental management standards have been imposed in the development licence and the joint venturers will outlay some $160 million in environmental protection funding.
* The Gorgon plant will occupy 1 per cent of the island's land.
LNG, LPG and CSG
* LNG is not LPG. The two products are often confused by the public.
* LPG - liquid petroleum gas - is composed primarily of propane (up to 95 per cent) and small quantities of butane.
* It is used mostly for residential and commercial applications and is maintained as a liquid by means of elevated pressure.
* LNG is primarily methane - it also contains some propane and ethane - and cannot be liquefied solely by pressurisation.
* Coal seam gas (CSG) is natural gas trapped in coal beds. Coal seams contain higher quantities of gas than are found in conventional reservoirs.
* CSG represents 40 per cent of Australia's onshore gas reserves.
* Australia's coal seam gas industry has experienced explosive growth in the past 15 years. Gladstone is emerging as an important export terminal.
* In the early 1990s, about 10 coal seam wells were being drilled every year. Now it is close to 600.
Proposed developments
* Feasibility studies are under way on development of LNG projects from conventional natural gas and coal seam methane in a huge arc of Northern Australia that stretches from the north-west to Queensland.
* Proposed developments include Chevron Australia's plan to exploit its wholly-owned Wheatstone discovery which it says may feed a five million tonne a year LNG train. A final investment decision is also expected in 2010 for the Browse Gas project to develop the very large, remote Torosa, Brecknock and Calliance fields that lie 750km north-east of the North-West Shelf fields. Woodside Energy has also mobilised a team to assess development options for the Greater Sunrise fields located 350 km north-west of Darwin. Meanwhile the massive expansion of coal seam methane prospects in Queensland over the past decade has seen five separate LNG projects proposed, using CSM from the Surat and Bowen coal fields to be processed at Gladstone.
* The total value of the proposals exceeds $30 billion and would involve export of almost 40 million tonnes of LNG annually if they all proceeded.
Future use
* Natural gas accounts for about 24 per cent of the world's primary energy supply. A third of this is used in fuelling electricity generation internationally - but gas at present accounts for only 13 per cent of Australia's power supply. This is forecast to almost double over the next 10-20 years as climate change policies drive down the use of coal in generation here and in a number of overseas countries.
* Apart from meeting residential cooking and space heating needs as well as heating of office buildings, school and hospitals, gas is both a heat source for manufacturers and an ingredient in the production of fertilisers, ink, paint, plastics, man-made fibres, laundry detergents and insect repellent, among other applications.
* Feasibility studies are being pursued in Australia and elsewhere in to the conversion of natural gas to synthetic diesel fuel and to jet fuel as an alternative to sourcing transport needs from crude oil.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"The industry and universities are uniting to ensure the right qualifications for the burgeoning sector
UNIVERSITY courses related to liquefied natural gas are likely to boom due to eight new proposals for extracting, processing and exporting LNG from Queensland's coal seam gas reserves.
 The Queensland government says exports are expected to start from 2012 in the $40 billion industry. It estimates a medium-sized industry could increase gross state product by 1 per cent, return $850 million in royalties to the state and create 18,000 jobs.
Most of the jobs would be in the trades but many key positions will be filled by university-trained recruits.
Some are concerned there won't be enough locally trained specialists to cope with demand and that the industry will have to go offshore to fill those positions.
A $10 million training program announced last month for Queensland would provide the industry mainly with trades-trained workers.
Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said the LNG sector would need anywhere from 400 to 800 engineers to keep up with growth.
``We don't have that supply of petroleum engineers; we don't even teach petroleum engineering in Queensland universities,'' he says.
Energy Skills Queensland is on the case. CEO Glenn Porter says the organisation is talking to the University of Queensland about a new petroleum engineering degree course (which will cover all things CSG and LNG) to start in the next few years.
``Given this is such a big industry, there is going to be massive demand for those qualifications,'' Porter says.
``ESQ and the industry -- Origin Energy, Santos, Queensland Gas Company and Arrow -- are in discussion with the university to try to establish its capability to deliver a degree.
``It's too early to say what will be in the curriculum.''
The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association cites the need for an appropriately skilled workforce and high demand for labour as ``potential impediments for the growth of our industry''.
Educating the next generation of engineers was ``certainly on the radar with Queensland University of Technology and Central Queensland University'', he says.
``There is some discussion with some of the bigger industry players with those universities about input into degree programs.''
Consultant Graeme Bethune, CEO of EnergyQuest, says companies ``are certainly getting behind the universities to provide training'', particularly through the universities of NSW and Adelaide and Curtin University.
The University of Western Australia, under an initiative called Future Framework, is adopting what is known as the Bologna model of education, which makes bachelor degree more general, saving specific study for the masters level. The University of Melbourne is the first in Australia to adopt the model. UWA will have it up and running by 2012.
What it means for resources education is that students will first do a science degree and then specialise in a field, says UWA Chevron professor of gas process engineering Eric May.
``All our engineering courses will get a revamp. It is a fantastic opportunity to fine-tune engineering and minerals programs and raise standards,'' May says.
UWA, a long-time supplier of technical graduates to the gas industry in that state, is branching out with a new graduate diploma this year in energy law.
UWA says its small first cohort will be trained in oil and gas law and legislation on commercialisation and infrastructure.
The new course, which will also include examination of real-life case studies, is a result of demand from students and employers.
UQ is also taking steps to make sure that the industry is run in a socially and environmentally responsible way.
The university's Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining and coal seam gas explorer and producer QGC have started a three-year partnership that will include professional development and research projects into community issues related to the industry, particularly its LNG project at Curtis Island. UQ Vice Chancellor Paul Greenfield said the agreement aligned with the university's ``commitment to strengthening engagement with industry and presents a new opportunity to provide knowledge that will benefit both industry and communities''.
May says a big issue for universities is retaining academics, who have proved to be only human when it has come to choosing between teaching classes or working in the lucrative industry.
Better pay is just one way of enticing teachers to stay, May says.
He also says that ``maybe the existing model of academics needs to be revised'' to introduce flexibility.
This is needed to allow academics to have a foot in both camps, the university and the work site, on a part-time basis in both.
Porter says the TAFE sector is vitally important to the industry, which will need thousands of welders, boilermakers, fitters, electricians, drillers and others just in the building phase.
Operations will require more skilled labour still.
``We (ESQ) are working with TAFE and other training organisations to gear up their capacities in designing new apprenticeship and traineeship programs to meet the needs of this industry.
``Three thousand wells need to be drilled over the next 20 years or so,'' he says.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"AS far as West Australian Premier Colin Barnett is concerned, natural gas is the biggest game in town.
``The projects will create thousands of jobs and position Western Australia as a world leader in the supply of clean, high-quality liquefied natural gas.''
 Estimates provided by the involved companies say the LNG industry will create about 28,000 jobs in Western Australia over the next decades.
The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association says Australia's production capacity for LNG is expected to increase from 20 million tonnes a year in 2008 to at least 50 million tonnes a year. APPEA says expansion in LNG facilities will pour billions of dollars a year into Australia's governments. A single new LNG project, for example, could pay $40 billion in tax and royalties over a typical project life, it says.
It is no surprise, then, that Mr Barnett told the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, Texas, on April 13 that the ``growth of the petroleum industry, both oil and gas, has been for Western Australia the most important economic change since the Pilbara iron ore projects of the 1960s''.
``In every sense, the biggest game in town is the development of mega-projects for the export of LNG. These projects, both existing and proposed, dwarf any other industrial projects in Australia.
``There is enough gas to transform the Western Australian economy and enough gas for export. This is, potentially, a 100-year resource.'' And such a resource would employ thousands of people over those years.
The WA Department of State Development's Prospect magazine, its international resources development magazine, for March-May says: ``Oil, gas and condensate projects will require a total of 14,700 construction workers, and 1260 operation (long term) workers.''
It says committed projects represent 7900 construction and 600 operation workers, and projects under considerations represent 6800 construction and 660 operation workers.
But these figures, which cover only the four main projects -- Gorgon, Browse, Wheatstone, and Pluto -- are lower by half than employment estimates provided by the LNG companies.
The companies' long-term employment projections make dramatic reading, and this is not to mention another four, smaller projects that will also soak up workers -- North Rankin, Macedon, Devil Creek and Scarborough.
All four are still in their earliest stages of development and will continue to grow and to need new workers.
Gorgon, the biggest project, is operated by Chevron (47.75 per cent) in joint venture with ExxonMobil (25 per cent), Shell (25 per cent), Osaka Gas (1.25 per cent) and Tokyo Gas (1 per cent).
Chevron Australia managing director Roy Krzywosinski has said Gorgon is forecast to create more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs and result in more than $33bn being spent on Australian goods and services
``Major construction activity is expected to commence in the second half of 2010, take about five years with first gas due in 2014,'' Mr Krzywosinski said.
The company believes the project will be ``an important pillar of the Australian economy for more than 40 years''.
Browse Basin, the second-biggest of the projects, is operated by Woodside Energy with partners BHP Billiton (North West Shelf), BP Developments Australia, Chevron Australia and Shell Development Australia.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte estimated in February that the Browse Basin LNG development would probably require 4000 to 5000 construction workers.
In addition, the state government is developing an LNG precinct in the Kimberley to enable processing of natural gas from the offshore Browse Basin, which the government says has ``proven reserves of 30 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas and 600 million barrels of condensate along with probable gas reserves estimated at 60 Tcf, making it comparable to the state's North West Shelf''.
The precinct will also contain LNG shipping facilities. The government says the project ``will involve billions of dollars, a major construction project and up to 400 long-term jobs for a resource expected to last at least 30 years''.
The third-biggest project at present is Wheatstone. Chevron is the operator and holds a 75 per cent interest in the project. Local company Apache and the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company share the balance.
Wheatstone is expected to create about 6500 direct and indirect jobs at the construction peak and involve about $15bn in local content spending over the project's life.
The fourth of the majors, Pluto, is owned by Woodside. Roger Martin, general manager of corporate communications at Woodside, says of the Pluto project: ``We expect contractors for Pluto to directly employ about 4000 people on the onshore site as peak construction continues until Q3 2010. The offshore installation workforce peaked at about 600 in mid-2009. The project is anticipated to create about 380 direct permanent jobs once operating.''
Mr Martin says that future expansions at Pluto Train 2 and Train 3 are expected to create a further 6000 direct jobs. From those company figures, the employment numbers are looking more like 28,000 jobs than the 14,700 mentioned by the government's Prospect magazine.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"HAVING learned the lessons from the skills shortage sparked by the resources boom a few years ago, Australia's newest energy industry has vowed not to be caught out. ith up to 22,000 extra workers needed to cater for the construction and operation of Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas/liquefied natural gas industry, recruiting and training a skilled workforce is an imperative.
``This is probably the only example of where an industry has actually formally planned for its workforce,'' says Energy Skills Queensland chief executive Glenn Porter.
 Established two years ago by Origin, Arrow Energy, Queensland Gas Company and Santos, Energy Skills Queensland's CSG/LNG Skills Taskforce focuses on workforce planning for the looming multi-billion-dollar industry. ``We have had the mining boom and unfortunately there wasn't a lot of planning done there -- it was just pillaging workers from other related industries by paying them more money,'' Porter says.
``Whereas this industry has actually tried to think a bit pro-actively and plan for its future and work with governments and industry stakeholders to actually ensure the supply of skills is there for its future.''
Porter says there are currently eight projects, with a total capital expenditure of $40 billion, aiming to take CSG from the Surat, Galilee and Bowen basins to be converted into LNG for export.
But there are just four -- BG Group, Santos-Petronas, Arrow-Shell-PetroChina and Origin-ConocoPhillips -- that are well on the path to building LNG plants and other related facilities on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour capable of producing up to 30 million tonnes or more of LNG a year over the estimated 25-year life span of the industry. `It's just mind-blowing how much gas is out there. It's huge. We will soon become the second biggest producer of gas in the world, the way we're going,'' Porter says.
Regardless of four or eight projects eventually get up, there will be thousands of jobs created and new skills needed.
Porter says job demand in the CSG/LNG industry must be divided into two areas -- construction and operations.
The construction phase involves building the LNG plants and facilities in Gladstone, and building and laying pipelines from the CSG fields and upstream equipment. The operations component takes in workers maintaining and operating the wells, compression and gas treatment plants, gas pipelines and in Gladstone LNG processing plants and storage and loading facilities.
``Being dependent upon how many projects get up, we believe there will be about 12,000 to 15,000 workers during the peak construction phase of about five to seven years and then a maximum of 7000 long-term position to operate the downstream, midstream and downstream CSG/LNG components,'' Porter says.
ESQ has identified jobs the industry requires but, in particular, critical shortages that could affect the industry's development.
These include drilling assistants, production and maintenance technicians, electrical and instrumentation technicians, logistics technicians/administrators, petroleum, chemical and mechanical engineers, geologists and geophysicists.
Porter says the demands of the industry are wide ranging but at this stage employers do not want to look overseas for skilled staff.
``The industry in Queensland really want to focus on training Queenslanders first, then bringing people in from interstate as a secondary option and bringing people in from offshore is really the last option,'' he says. `There will be a requirement for some highly skilled people with specialist skills, probably brought in from offshore, but hopefully they are used to train local people and allow those skills to be transferred into the local labour market.''
Porter says ESQ has been liaising with employers and teaching institutions to prepare for the looming demand.
``This is a very new industry for Queensland, so there is a lack of training capability at the moment but to their credit the local TAFE and private providers are gearing up very rapidly to train apprentices and trainees as well as new workers coming into the industry from related industries such as mining, construction or manufacturing,'' he says.
``And the industry and the Queensland government are working together to create the CSG/LNG skills program -- a $10 million program to fund training for new and existing workers in the industry.
``University of Queensland has been in contact with us and they're looking at developing a petroleum chemical engineering undergraduate qualification specifically for the coal seam gas and natural gas industry. We're also working with the University of NSW, who already run a similar degree program out of Sydney and we will hopefully be brokering some co-operation between them and UQ.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"DEVELOPERS of multi-billion-dollar LNG projects from the vast reserves of coal-seam gas in Queensland are finding they are also having to rapidly acquire expertise in water management.
The nature of CSG production means vast amounts of water are released during the process.
 Wells are drilled up to 1.2km deep to access coal seams, where gas formed by the same processes that created the coal is held by pressure and water.
Water must be pumped out so pressure can be reduced and the gas allowed to flow to the surface.
It is almost the opposite of conventional gas operations, where the flow of gas is initially strong, but with little water released.
The quantities to be released by coal-seam gas operations are phenomenal: Santos estimates that it will have to deal with 57 megalitres, the equivalent of 30 olympic-size pools, a day from its fields around Roma and Fairview in southwest Queensland.
The question is: what to do with the water? It can't simply be returned to where it came from, and much of it is saline and inappropriate for use, so it all needs to be treated first.
Evaporation ponds had been favoured in the past, but these are no longer deemed environmentally acceptable, particularly with the significant amounts of water to be released from the huge LNG projects on the drawing board.
Santos has focused its attention on using water for irrigation, and has announced plans to establish the largest private irrigated hardwood plantation in the country, as well as more than 2000ha of agricultural feed crops.
Thousands of kilometres or irrigation pipelines are being rolled out and the company has already planted almost a million Chinchilla white gum trees at its Fairview Irrigation project, with plans to lift that to about three million trees and possibly double that.
The plantations could be used for timber harvesting or carbon sequestration, or even both.
The tree is a native that is salt, drought and frost resistant.
According to Santos, timber harvesting could occur at years six and eight, and could produce up to 400cu m of saw logs per hectare for milling.
The company says a further 234ha of centre pivot irrigation has been constructed, which is providing water to winter crops now and will eventually be applied to Leucaena, a high-quality cattle forage that could be expected to increase beef production in the area. Total feed crops could total more than 2000ha.
A spokesman for Santos said it was important to take care with the type of water use, and not create crops or other industries that would not be sustainable when gas fields were depleted and the water flow removed.
``It's a balancing act of a whole range of issues,'' he says.
``We want to use the water in the local community and we don't want to pipe it elsewhere.''
Another concern is the brine created from the desalination fields.
He said this was to be reinjected in deep salty coal seams.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"STRANDED gas is a pain in the neck for petroleum companies and governments looking to benefit by taxing production, and nowhere is the issue bigger than offshore Australia.
Off the West Australian coast , far beyond the continental shelf in water more than a kilometre deep, there are vast natural gas resources able to meet Australian demand for a century, according to the CSIRO. But their depth and distance from shore make them inaccessible.
 The CSIRO Wealth from Oceans research program as much as half the country's gas resources, worth $1,000 billion at today's prices, are locked away in these fields, ``and there could be vast quantities more on the extended continental shelf approved by the UN in 2008.''
The problem is worldwide. Consultants Energtek estimates that as much as 40 per cent of known reserves are classified untappable, holding energy equivalent to the total oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. This represents more than 20 times the stranded gas resources of Australia.
With such a big prize to be captured in a century where it is widely agreed that energy security will be a continuous global strategic issue, it is not surprising that companies, engineers and scientists are devoting much time and money to finding ways to reach these riches.
A big technological shift for LNG producers has come with the development of Russia's Far East Sakhalin Island gas resources in the past decade. Described by Anton Chekhov as ``a hellish place,'' Sakhalin's icy seas hold a petroleum treasure trove on the edge of a major market in Japan and South Korea, but atrocious working conditions, including exposure to ice storms and earthquakes, and the impossibility of using pipelines has kept the gas unused until recently.
Until Sakhalin, LNG developments had happened only in countries where temperatures are relatively high all year round. The Shell Group, which has played a leading role in unlocking Sakhalin gas, had to come up with a new project engineering approach, introducing a two-stage liquefaction process to deal with the cold environment. Although the development has to use electricity to keep the ground below storage tanks from freezing, it uses less energy than equivalent plants in the Middle East and Far East, enabling more gas to be sold and keeping down production carbon emissions.
An important step in dealing with remote gas is the development of floating production facilities and Australia, along with Africa, is the focus for what is expected to be a major marine innovation this decade.
Analysts Douglas-Westwood Ltd forecast that $US23 bn will be spent on FLNG facilities by 2016, with the first likely to be used to exploit Shell's Prelude and Concerto fields, 500 km from Broome in the Timor Sea.
The market for FLNGs is seen to be substantial. While land-based LNG operations are accessing between 70 and 80 large fields, it is claimed floating installations exploit some 1400 fields in the small to medium range, resources too low to justify the big expense of a land-based operation.
Some analysts caution that FLNG progress may not be as rosy as predicted, arguing that technological and financing risks may be unpalatable to investors and financiers. .
The successful introduction of the first few FLNGs therefore will be critical to their wider use.
The Shell FLNG for the Timor Sea is expected to be 480 metres long, 75 metres wide, weigh more than 600,000 tonnes fully ballasted and be able to produce 3.5 million tonnes of LNG a year along with condensate and LPG.
A big advantage of the FLNG concept is that the plant can be moved to other fields later. The Prelude/Concerto project is expected to have a 20-year life.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ONCE a region based mainly on grazing and agriculture, the Surat Basin has become the El Dorado for Queensland's newest export industry.
While the underground riches in the Surat Energy Resources Province have been known for decades, it has taken time for technology to catch up to enable industry to tap the vast reserves of coal seam gas and create a liquefied natural gas industry.
 From about 10 CSG exploration wells being drilled annually in the 1990s, it is expected there will be about 34,000 CSG wells drilled in the Surat Basin in what was once the sole preserve of graziers, farmers and agriculturalists.
The once sleepy towns west of Toowoomba are booming and welcoming an ever increasing population spurred on by the state government's expectations of 4000 jobs to be directly created in the region by the CSG/LNG industry alone.
``These jobs will pump revenue into these economies and create demand for a range of industrial infrastructure, housing developments and social infrastructures such as community centres and sporting and recreational facilities that communities need,'' Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser says. With the influx of geologists, geophysicists, drilling engineers and assistants, technicians, engineers of all sorts and other highly skilled professionals and para-professionals, the region has already undergone a huge change, with more to come.
People from other regions of Queensland, interstate and overseas are flooding into the once tiny townships. And after years of seeing their sons and daughter having to leave home to get a job locals are now welcoming them back and have expectations that their children will stay.
A CSG/LNG Workforce Development Plan is looking at training the more than 5000 high school students from the Surat and Darling Downs regions who will have the opportunity to focus their education and careers on the CSG/LNG industry.
The South Queensland Institute of TAFE, which has campuses throughout the Surat region, is being funded to focus its resources and training on the CSG/LNG industry, while a Mining Industry Skills Centre has been established at Moranbah.
This has meant that the population of the Western Downs local government area, which is the epicentre of the CSG mother lode and takes in Dalby, Chinchilla, and Wandoan, is expected to more than double to 75,000 over the next few years.
Fraser acknowledges that the challenge to the Surat Basin communities is to ensure that development provides a good lifestyle as well as economic benefits.
Unemployment in the region has fallen to below 2 per cent, but big wage packets combined with a severe shortage of housing has meant builders can't keep up, sending house prices sky-rocketing. This population boom has also put pressure on transport infrastructure as well as medical, police, education and other essential services.
Of particular concern to farmers is the possibility of environmental degradation with potentially 500 million litres a day of water being extracted from the CSG wells, containing hundreds of tonnes of salt.
Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown has continually called for a balance between development and its impact on the social fabric of the region. ``Here we are, a rural based region and you have this huge influx of people coming in here,'' he says.
``Now you stick that in small country towns you'll have a major social impact, not only in housing but all the infrastructure, water sewerage, roads, the whole lot, that's where planning is so crucial at the moment.
``We're not planning just for the short term, we're planning for the long term here.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"Making gas into a liquid is a hard but very rewarding task
AUSTRALIA'S liquefied natural gas industry is already worth billions a year to the economy and is going to become an increasingly vital part of our fuel and energy supply. But there are glitches, hiccoughs and inefficiencies in its processing and conversion, and all of these are coming under the microscopes at CSIRO to see what improvements are possible. Any efficiency or cost-effectiveness gains will make the industry even more valuable.
 Nick Burke is the research group leader of the natural gas processing and conversion group at CSIRO's Earth Science and Resource Engineering division. He is responsible for a range of research projects all concentrating on different aspects of natural gas - its treatment, processing and conversion into other things such as transport fuel.
``There are three main elements we are working on. One is making the processing of LNG more efficient and cost effective. Another is using natural gas to create other transport fuels, and the third is ways of extracting hydrogen from natural gas using more effective technologies,'' Dr Burke says.
Australia, CSIRO says, has a rich endowment of natural gas, most of which is located in deep waters offshore or as coal seam gas. By its nature, gas is difficult and expensive to transport over long distances so CSIRO is looking at different ways to liquefy or transform natural gas into a transportable liquid product.
The research body explains that LNG production involves cooling natural gas to temperatures where the gas becomes a liquid, taking up 600 times less space than the corresponding gas. In its liquefied form, natural gas can be more easily stored or transported by ship to worldwide markets.
``Natural gas is a complex mixture of chemicals with different chemical and physical properties. Natural gas undergoes a series of purification steps prior to liquefaction and transportation. The gas is cooled and certain compounds known as natural gas liquids or NGLs that condense or solidify are removed throughout the cooling process. These compounds can cause blockages in the LNG production equipment and lead to plant operational problems. Their presence also reduces the purity of the liquid gas and can mean that the LNG falls short of customer specifications,'' CSIRO explains.
Existing technologies are not able to remove all NGLs. Consequently, routine shutdowns of plant equipment for cleaning and adjustments of gas composition either before or after shipping are required, so CSIRO is investigating how to improve techniques used in LNG processing to separate and remove NGLs before the gas is liquefied.
``We are looking at ways to convert gas into liquid fuel more cheaply. Impurities in natural gas cause two problems. They can upset the production process, leading to the costly business of cooling the plant down, removing blockages and then firing the plant up again.
``The second problem is that if there are too many impurities remaining once the gas has been converted to LNG, then those impurities will need to be removed after transportation when the LNG is being converted back into gas for the customer's use.
`` It is more efficient and cost effective to remove as many impurities as possible in the first stage of processing, and not have to purify it twice, which also doubles the time and value lost.
``We're looking at a range of novel technologies and testing how applicable they are to gas purification. The results are promising. Our industrial partners are excited about it, as are we,'' Dr Burke says, and is hopeful a production facility might be possible in about five years.
The second major focus of CSIRO's research is using natural gas to create other transport fuels such as petrol and diesel.
Processes that convert natural gas to liquid fuels are known as gas-to-liquids or GTL processes.
``It is a very good idea for Australia to convert gas to fuels since we have limited reserves of crude oil, from which all our transport fuels are derived,'' Dr Burke says. ``Making synthetic fuels from gas, of which Australia has large resources, will help the country be more self-sufficient and secure in its supply of transport fuels.''
The diversity and compatibility of synthetic fuels mean that they can be used in existing engines. Synthetic fuels have a number of benefits including the ability to be produced to ``cleaner'' specifications, with lower contents of sulphur and nitrogen oxides that contribute to a range of environmental pollutants including smog, acid rain and ground-level ozone, CSIRO says. In an engine, synthetic fuels demonstrate equal or superior performance to oil-derived fuels and can be used in a pure form or as a high quality blending component.
CSIRO's third research focus is on extracting hydrogen from natural gas.
``Hydrogen is a very handy chemical that you add to things to make a more refined product. Oil refineries and chemical plants use hydrogen. There is a good economic incentive to extract it from gas and an even stronger one for extracting it more cost effectively,'' Dr Burke says.
``The traditional process for taking hydrogen from natural gas produces CO2 but not in a concentrated form.
``We are using unconventional processes that produce purer streams of hydrogen and CO2 so that disposal of the CO2 is easier and less expensive.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Petroleum appears to be on track for a more fruitful year this year after a recovery in the oil price boosted first-quarter revenue, helping to offset lower production caused by asset sales, planned maintenance shutdowns and natural resource declines at some of its assets.
Australia's second-largest oil and gas company also said it expected to complete construction of its massive Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia on time, meaning it should start producing gas late this year and start shipping LNG to Asian customers early next year.
 Oil, gas and condensate production for the three months to March 31 fell 7 per cent year on year to 19.2 million barrels of oil equivalent, putting Woodside on track to meet its recently reduced annual production guidance of 70-75 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Woodside did not mention the figure yesterday and a spokesman for the company confirmed that ``there is no update on our production guidance''.
The Perth-based company said the lower output reflected the sale of its stake in the Otway gas project off Victoria to free up capital for its LNG development pipeline.
It also reflects a 46-day planned maintenance shutdown at its Stybarrow platform off Western Australia and natural field decline in oil production from Stybarrow, and Enfield, which are also off Western Australia, and Neptune in the US.
The fall in output was kept reasonably light by increased LNG production from the North West Shelf terminal due to facility availability.
Woodside, however, flagged 22-day and 14-day shutdowns of the plant's third and fifth production trains during the second quarter for maintenance.
A recovery in the oil price helped boost Woodside's first-quarter revenue by 43 per cent year on year to $1.03 billion, although the fall in group production led to a 10 per cent decline in revenue compared to the previous quarter.
Woodside is transforming itself into a world leader in LNG and has three growth projects it is working on in addition to Pluto. It wants to expand Pluto and build another two LNG plants, Browse and Sunrise.
There was little news from Woodside about those growth projects yesterday. Woodside needs to find more gas for the Pluto project and investors will be eagerly awaiting the results of further drilling.
The market is still waiting for an announcement on Woodside's preferred development concept for the Sunrise project, which will require the approval of the East Timorese governement.

 The PNG plant, being developed by US energy giant ExxonMobil, is scheduled to churn out about eight million tonnes of LNG a year, once the currently planned two trains - or processing units - are in place by 2014-15.
But Mr Botten told shareholders Oil Search would by then hope to have enough gas for another two trains.
That is about the time that the four LNG plants based on Queensland Coal seam gas, proposed for Gladstone, all hope to be churning out their own first production.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"The nation's miners are anxiously waiting to see if the long awaited Henry Report will recommend higher taxes for the sector, write Paul Garvey, Annabel Hepworth and Luke Forrestal.
Leading chief executives warn that uncertainty about the impacts of the Henry tax review could delay investment in the fast-growing coal-seam gas Â­industry, threatening Australia's long-term positioning as a prime destination for resources projects.
 The review is expected to recommend that federal taxes now levied at 40 per cent on certain offshore petroleum projects are applied to all onshore mining and resources projects, including the emerging coal-seam gas projects in Queensland and NSW, which are currently covered by state royalty regimes.
Proponents of the coal-seam gas to liquefied natural gas developments have been scrambling to lock in supply deals with customers in the growing Asian energy markets, which are necessary to underpin the multi-billion dollar projects.
Santos chief executive David Knox urged the government to  maintain the current fiscal situation  to protect the massive capital investments needed.
 At a time when companies like ours and several others are considering very large developments, my caution would be that now is not a good time to be changing the fiscal regime,  Knox told The Australian Financial Review.
 We rely on a stable fiscal setup in order to make these massive investment decisions. Any change in fiscal regime would require a huge amount of studying and have the risk of delaying potential investment decisions. 
Companies such as Santos have aggressively pursued expectations that coal-seam-gas-to-LNG projects will allow them to tap Asia-led demand for energy. In Queensland, several multi-billion dollar coal seam gas LNG projects are being considered.
While optimism about the sector has surged after the signing of recent LNG export deals worth tens of billions of dollars each, project proponents are competing with projects around the world for limited resources to finance and construct LNG terminals.
Origin Energy chief executive Grant King says he feared that a tax slug could undermine projects.
 We're concerned to the obvious extent that any proposed change creates uncertainty, and at a time when we and others are trying to make large investment decisions that uncertainty obviously goes to returns. Hence our concern,  King says.
It is widely expected that the tax review chaired by federal Treasury secretary Ken Henry proposes replacing a plethora of inconsistent state royalty regimes with a 40 per cent resources rent tax on mining and energy projects, modelled on the resources rent tax currently imposed on crude oil and natural gas in federal waters.
While such a system only taxes projects turning a profit and is thus designed to recognise the risks of investment in exploration and infrastructure, there has been growing concern within the resources sector that it faces a  tax grab .
Over the weekend, federal Treasurer Wayne Swan was playing down suggestions the government would hit mining companies with a resources rent tax on top of state royalties that already reap about $7 billion.
The government is releasing the Henry report and the government's response on Sunday. But Swan says he will not speculate on the contents of the review and cautioned against  hysterical short-term reactions  to speculation.
Nevertheless, concerns about the shift to a national resources rent tax in the Henry review have sparked debate across the energy resources sector. Australian Worldwide Exploration managing director Bruce Wood says projects will be less likely to proceed if there is a higher tax take.
 I don't think we need to beat around the bush, any increase in tax or government take, which is what they're talking about, onshore will affect where projects go,  Wood says.
King agrees the issue is  not a philosophical discussion  about the merits of resources rent taxes compared to royalties.
His concern is that the resources sector will bear a heavier load of the tax burden.
 That's the real concern, that there's maybe this primary agenda to change the tax burden. And my view there's been enough to indicate that's been the agenda. And that'd be of great concern to us,  King says.
Miners warn that a significant contributor to the nation's wealth could be discouraged by a higher tax take.
 It's a very powerful disincentive not to enter the industry,  says one of the highest-profile players in Australia's mining industry, former Oxiana chief executive Owen Hegarty.
 We've got to encourage all that. We need to increase our mineral inventory. Encourage it, nurture it, help it grow at all levels, at the junior level. Don't give it a disincentive or it will become just another also-ran. 
Felix Resources managing director Brian Flannery says the industry needs to see the detail in the report and he hopes the tax review  doesn't kill the goose that laid the egg .
 The only way we are going to pay for the stimulus package is to continue to have a robust resource industry,  Flannery says.
Silver Lake managing director Les Davis said that a higher tax take could lead to spending cuts elsewhere.
 Whether that be a job or a drill-hole, or a piece of mine development, something will suffer,  Davis says.
There are also fears the recent recovery in minerals exploration spending across Australia could be undermined by a higher tax impost.
Juniors, which traditionally conduct a significant proportion of the country's exploration for new deposits, are already struggling to tap markets for cash injections.
 I think it's right that the smaller guys will be hurt the most. I think we're only just beginning to realise the potential impact that this can have on producers,  says Western Areas chief executive Julian Hanna. The tax review already promises to be significant for the resources sector, which has been concerned about the lack of a flow-through shares program promised by Labor during the 2007 election campaign.
Investor confidence had already been damaged by reports about the expected overhaul of resources taxes in the Henry review, the industry says.
This is a particular concern for cash-strapped emerging mining companies already struggling to secure capital, according to Association of Mining and Exploration Companiesok chief executive Simon Bennisonok.
 It's the uncertainty, it adds to it,  Bennison says.  You don't need a lot of uncertainty to turn around to your board and say, 'If we have to make a decision now, let's go offshore because we know there's certainty offshore, we know what our cost structure is going to be, and we'll come back to Australia when the governments have sorted themselves out and we know what's happening.'â€Š''
However, Bennison acknowledges that because the existing federal petroleum resource rent tax only applies when a firm has earned above natural or  super  profits, this might benefit the juniors.
 That is an option. And we say to the states that they could look at doing that at a state level. Some do. 
This was echoed by Atlas Iron chief financial officer Mark Hancock, who says there could be advantages in being taxed  when your project is able to bear it better .
 It might mean that the time you're looking to get your project up and running you're in a sort of royalty holiday by virtue of capital recoveries and later in the project when you have basically been reimbursed that capital and you have got more free cash, your liability comes at that point in time,  Hancock says.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"After years of speculation, the Sunrise Joint Venture has finally announced it will build a floating liquefied natural gas processing plant in the Timor Sea.
The Greater Sunrise field is in both Australian and Timorese waters, about 700 kilometres north-west of Darwin, and the two countries will have an equal share of royalties.
 The floating rig means Darwin will miss out on having a multi-billion dollar plant built there.
Operator Woodside Petroleum says after considering on-shore LNG processing in both Darwin and East Timor, the joint venture partners, which include Osaka Gas, Shell and ConocoPhillips, decided a floating plant was the most viable.
Woodside CEO Don Voelte says the decision is a boon for the new but impoverished democracy.
 We expect that the selection of a floating LNG processing option will, in addition to generating significant long-term petroleum revenue, provide a broad range of social investment, employment and training opportunities for Timor-Leste.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ENERGY
WOODSIDE Petroleum is set to announce as early as tomorrowthat it plans to develop the big Greater Sunrise gasfields in the Timor Sea through a floating LNG platform, dashing the chances of a $5 billion liquefied natural gas plant at Darwin.
 The Australian understands the four joint venture partners have come to an agreement on a concept to develop the field, but are still going through the formalities of finalising the decision.
Woodside, as operator of the field, is hoping to be able to make the announcement at its annual general meeting in Perth tomorrow.
Yesterday, a Woodside spokesman would not confirm the concept had been decided on.
``As we have previously said, we expect a decision to be made soon,'' he said.
``When one is reached, we will be advising the ASX.''
Woodside and its partners -- Shell, ConocoPhillips and Osaka Gas -- have been weighing up whether to concentrate on a floating LNG ship to produce 4 million tonnes of LNG a year or an extension to ConocoPhillips' existing onshore Darwin LNG plant, which would produce 5 million tonnes a year.
Ongoing delays in agreeing on a concept mean the timetable for a final investment decision on Sunrise has been pushed back from 2011 until 2012, according to a Woodside presentation made in February. First LNG is targeted for 2016.
In the February presentation, Woodside chief executive Don Voelte said the economics were strong for both development at Darwin -- Conoco' preference -- and through floating LNG, Shell's preference.
It is believed the development concept of the field has been influenced by East Timor, which has recently stepped up calls for Sunrise to be developed through an onshore plant there.
This is despite Woodside, in mid-2008, ruling out an East Timor plant.
The Greater Sunrise fields, which contain 5.3 trillion cubic feet of gas, sit on the border of Australian territorial waters and the Timor Sea's joint petroleum development area, where East Timor and Australia split royalties 90/10 per cent.
Under a 2006 agreement, both nations have agreed to split royalties from the fields 50/50.
In January, East Timor secretary of state Agio Pereira said neither of Woodside's options would be be approved because the government was not confident of the company's assessments that the East Timor option was not commercially viable.
Privately, the joint venture partners had hoped the vocal East Timorese proclamations were more an attempt to grab a better deal and gain public approval than an non-negotiable position.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Stock watch
The $3.5 billion takeover bid by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina for coal-seam gas player Arrow Energy has provided a handy boost for utility AGL Energy.
 The offer has helped awaken the market to the value of AGL's stake in the Moranbah gasfield, one of the largest within Arrow's Queensland portfolio.
Under the Arrow-AGL joint venture, AGL can take a 50 per cent stake at any time by paying for half of the successful exploration costs incurred at the project.
This is likely to be of great interest to Shell and PetroChina, which would no doubt like AGL's share of gas from Moranbah to underpin their major proposed liquefied natural gas development at Gladstone.
While Moranbah is a big part of AGL's stated goal of reaching 2000 petajoules of gas reserves as a hedge for its downstream business, managing director Michael Fraser has said he's happy to sell Moranbah at the right price.
Any sale by AGL would provide it with even more funding for use in its core business, and in particular in its roll-out of wind-farm developments.
But just what AGL might fetch for Moranbah, and whether an offer from Shell for Moranbah is the lay-down misere some take it for, is the subject of debate among analysts.
Selling Moranbah on similar terms to Shell's offer for Arrow could realise about $1.2 billion for AGL â€“ an exceptional return on the $93 million AGL paid BHP Billiton for the stake in 2006, Citigroup analyst Marie Miyashiro said.
Given that AGL used the $2 billion reaped from the sale of its stakes in the Papua New Guinea LNG project and coal-seam gas company Queensland Gas to pay off debt and strengthen its balance sheet, any proceeds could go straight to AGL's wind farms.
AGL has secured what it believes are the top wind-farm development sites in Australia. Building them will be a costly process, but a necessary one given the federal government's mandatory 2020 renewable energy target.
Recent legislative changes to the pricing of renewable energy certificates (RECs) has added certainty to the economics of meeting this target.  The potential cash proceeds would support an additional 370 megawatts of new wind-farm development to underpin its internal REC book,  Ms Miyashiro said.
 The benefits accrue in reinvestment as the proceeds would facilitate near-term execution of a relatively large capacity, placing it in good stead to take advantage of the REC shortage that we expect to occur in the next few years. 
Ms Miyashiro rates AGL a buy on the expectation it can efficiently fund its wind-farm developments, with a price target of $16.60.
Goldman Sachs JBWere analyst Kynwynn Strong is more circumspect about Moranbah.
If Shell bought out AGL's stake at the same terms as the Arrow bid, it could be worth up to $3 a share to AGL. However, Ms Strong values the stake at just 50Â¢ a share, based on the assumption AGL sells its gas from the project to Shell over 20 years at prevailing domestic gas prices.
 We see a bid by [Shell and PetroChina] for AGL's Bowen assets as unlikely as AGL's reserves are not sufficient to make large-scale LNG viable and we see limited other buyers for either the reserves outright or gas offtake,  Ms Strong said.
 We see a gas sales agreement between [Shell and PetroChina] and AGL as the most logical outcome for both parties and this is reflected in our base valuation. 
GSJBW has looked closely at the prospect of a profit upgrade from AGL in the coming weeks, and doesn't expect to see one.
Ms Strong sees AGL shares as fairly valued in the mid-$15s, at which level its relative price-earnings ratio sits at a 10 per cent premium to market versus an average premium of 11 per cent.
To revisit this hold call, Ms Strong would need to see earnings upgrades of at least 10 per cent, crystallisation of the Moranbah value and greater appetite for defensive investments such as AGL.
 If the market becomes more confident of the economic recovery and favours cyclical stocks, it is unlikely that AGL would continue to justify its current PE premium to the market of 10 per cent,  Ms Strong said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"WOODSIDE MELBOURNE, April 30 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd will send a high-level team including chief executive Don Voelte to East Timor, after the tiny nation threatened to sink plans for a multi-billion-dollar gas project.
East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, on Friday accused the Australian oil and gas company of arrogance over a decision not to house a liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing plant on its shores.
 It threatened to pull the plug on a planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) development at the Greater Sunrise fields, between Australia and East Timor.
The oil company responded at its annual general meeting in Perth, where Mr Voelte promised to send a delegation to East Timor next week.
 Myself and the head of our Sunrise project, Jon Ozturgut, and our team will travel to Dili next week as well as to Darwin and speak to the Northern Territory's Chief Minister Paul Henderson as well as the various officials include (Jose) Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor Leste,  Mr Voelte said.
The statement from East Timor's government came after Woodside on Thursday revealed that joint venture partners unanimously agreed to use a floating platform to process LNG from the Greater Sunrise fields.
Woodside is the operator of the joint venture project that also has participation from ConocoPhillips, Shell and Osaka Gas.
Both Darwin and East Timor had been vying to house the $5 billion facility, which will process the gas from the huge field, believed to have a gas resource of 5.13 trillion cubic feet, plus 225.9 million barrels of condensate.
East Timor's secretary of state for the Council of Ministers, H.E. Agio Pereira, on Friday said his nation was committed to building an onshore petroleum industry, which included a pipeline from his country to the Greater Sunrise field.
 Timor-Leste will not approve any development of Greater Sunrise that does not include a pipeline to Timor-Leste,  Mr Pereira said.
 Woodside was acutely aware of the government's position before today's announcement but chose to proceed regardless.
 This is not only a source of great concern, but reflects an unacceptable level of arrogance,  Mr Pereira said.
Mr Voelte said East Timor's reaction was premature.
 I just know what is going to happen and that is the citizens of Timor-Leste are going to start to wonder why their government doesn't promote something that will improve their lives, will provide millions of dollars of income, provide jobs and everything else,  Mr Voelte told the shareholders' meeting.
 It is probably just a bit of positioning I suspect,  he said.
Woodside has said it chose the floating LNG option because under an agreement between East Timor and Australia in 2007 the fields had to be developed in line with best commercial advantage.
RBS analyst Johannes Faul said Mr Voelte should have been smarter in the way he approached working with the East Timorese government.
 He has obviously got them offside so now has has to fly up,  Mr Faul said.
 It is all about damage control and to contain their (East Timor's) anger,  he said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"South-west Queensland's booming coal seam gas industry is causing so much anxiety it is only a matter of time before someone takes their own life, a farm business consultant says.
Rod Saal says he was not surprised by reports earlier this month that a landowner at Tara threatened to shoot a gas worker. He says many farmers feel ignored by government and powerless when dealing with the energy companies.
  I'm worried someone will pop some poor bastard from the gas companies, and my clients are the type that would be so remorseful they'd shoot themselves,  he said.
He likens what is happening on the Darling Downs around Dalby and further west to Roma to how the banks dealt with farmers in the 1990s.
 It's a David and Goliath thing. I spent a lot of time in the '90s dealing with farmers' and banks' mediations and foreclosures. I am seeing exactly the same sort of approach,  he said.
 It is really creating immense anguish. It is not a long time before someone pulls a trigger out there. 
One of the reasons relations between farmers and the energy companies are strained is because farmers have no right to the energy resource under their soil.
 The government owns the resource. The farmer, while he or she may own their property 100 per cent freehold, that does not give them the rights to the resource,  Bow energy's Tory Shenstone said.
Gas companies can legally enter private land, install wells, lay pipes and build the necessary infrastructure to compress and transport gas.
For the inconvenience compensation is paid, but as there is no set figure, farmers have to negotiate the best deal, per well per year, they can.
Anecdotes from the industry's early days, when different companies were involved, claim some landowners received a couple of slabs of beer in compensation.
Drew Wagner, a senior policy director from rural lobby group Agforce, says it is a challenge for farmers to share their land.
 It is the invasiveness of having that industry on your property, the inability of you to be able to manage your entire area the way in which you may have always managed it, and just the sheer number of people in and out of the place,  he said.
Mr Wagner says some energy companies and their contractors have not behaved well.
 We have all heard the horror stories. Gates have been left open. We have seen dams sullied by onground water that has been put across from some of their drill sites or even some of the pipelines that have been put in place, so the general position of access is one of great difficulty,  he said.
 Like any industry, most people will say it is the minority that will cruel it for the majority, the unfortunate reality here is that the minority is quite large. 
Ms Shenstone says land access is a significant challenge for all coal seam gas companies.
 Accessing Crown land resources by entering freehold land by its very nature on the face of it seems to be diametrically opposed,  she said.
She says while some farmers are happy to receive an annual payment that is not dependent on the weather or commodity prices, most just want to be treated well.
 They wanted you to respect their property and to conduct yourself properly with courtesy and respect,  she said.
 You are in our backyard and you are in our livelihood and you are in our home. Half the time it was not about the money, it was, 'sweetheart, I don't want your 10 grand, I just want you to do the right thing'. 
Santos Queensland area manager Sam Klass says his company wants to get on with farmers.
 It is a long-term relationship, so it is really important that it is a strong and trusting relationship because if it's not it will be difficult for either of us to do business,  he said.
 Most of our landholder advisers are people who have been on the land themselves or still have country, so they can tend to take a lot of the landholder point of view when we go on there. They try to minimise the impact we have when we do arrive on their doorstep.
 A code of conduct has just been introduced by the Government and we have been a party to contributing to that and I believe there certainly needs to be some consistency in the way we approach landholders and the way we deal with them. 
When Dalby grain grower Wayne Newton discovered there were plans to drill for gas on his property he was unsure how it would affect his operation.
 I did not have any understanding of what my rights were or what the company's ability to access my land was,  he said.
 I really was coming in totally from the dark. I was in a knowledge vacuum on the subject and I had a bit of trepidation about that. 
He says he will fight any moves to put roads across his laser-levelled cropping land.
 It will be over my dead body. There is no way I want gravel roads built across my farming land,  he said.
 They can take us to the land court and gain access to this property and put their infrastructure in and I can't stop them, but we will be working as hard as we can, making as much noise as we have, to try to let both government and the public and these resource companies know that they have to do it right. 
Origin Energy's executive general manager for upstream oil and gas, Paul Zealand, says Origin treats its farmers with respect.
 And we hope we get the same ultimately back from those people in return. We have rights as well, so what we would like is to [have] our rights respected the same way we respect the rights of the landowner. We have got to find a way to work together,  he said.
 Our objective is to have the minimum impact when we are developing and then to be as invisible as we can once we are operating. 
As well as worrying how they are going to run two businesses on the same dirt, farmers have serious concerns about the impact the coal seam gas industry is having on underground water supplies.
Ground water feeds bores and springs, and with State Government experts unable to say what a massive dewatering of the region's coal seams over several decades will do to underground aquifers, farmers like Mr Newton are nervous about water security.
 The Queensland Government has released reports that indicate the amount of water that could be going to be removed in this area could be up to 370 gigalitres per year,  he said.
 That is an enormous amount of water. With that much water coming to the surface, what is going to happen down below?
 If enough water is pumped out from depth one could assume it would be quite easy for that shallower alluvium water, the water we depend on for our livelihoods in this area, just to drain down and be destroyed. 
As CSG water is usually saline, farmers are also worried about what will be done with the millions of tonnes of salt that will be brought to the surface every year for the next 30 or 40 years.
Mr Zealand reassures farmers the salt is being contained.
 We know exactly where it is and it won't be spread all over the land. It will be contained in ponds and ultimately as the project progresses years down the road we will find some other disposal options for that salt,  he said.
The State Government says it understands landowners are facing increased pressure for access to their land for exploration and production activities.
It has introduced make-good provisions so if water supplies are affected farmers will be compensated.
To take some of the heat out of the negotiation process it has funded a Legal Aid position in Toowoomba and two mining registrars in Roma.
A land access working group is currently working with energy companies to develop a joint code of conduct, but after two years it is yet to issue a report.
Mr Newton says the industry is huge and well funded, but farmers must stand their ground.
 People around here have told us, 'oh, what is the point of fighting, they are going to win',  he said.
 But if you don't fight, if you don't stand up for your rights and for those things that you know are right, they will always walk over the top of you.
 We know in relation to so many of the environmental matters, the salt, the water, just accessing our properties and being on this area, we have to fight for our rights or we won't get any.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Ukraine's parliament erupted into what looked like a fully fledged riot this week over a controversial vote to extend a Russian navy lease.
The treaty clears the way for the Black Sea fleet to stay in Crimea until 2042 in return for a 30 per cent reduction in Ukraine's price of natural gas imports.
 It also signals a dramatic return to Russia's embrace under Ukraine's new president Viktor Yanukovych.
Many say the vote means Ukraine's Orange Revolution, which grabbed headlines around the world more than five years ago, is well and truly over.
Parliamentary speaker Vladimir Litvin, who was forced to take refuge under an umbrella as eggs rained down on him during the parliamentary brawl, is glad to see it go.
He says not a single promise of the revolution was fulfilled, and the authorities who took up office with the people's support exhibited only their corruption and ability to quarrel between each other.
In fact, disagreements between the two leaders of the Orange Revolution, president Viktor Yushchenko and prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, may be its best known legacy.
But while they battled on, old rival Mr Yanukovych never went away.
He won the presidency in February, beating Ms Tymoshenko, and has wasted no time in turning Ukraine back towards Moscow.
Ms Tymoshenko has in the meantime re-established herself as the leader of the opposition.
She spoke to ABC's PM from the middle of her fight against the Russian navy deal, calling it one more favour for the Kremlin and the local oligarch tycoons who back the new president.
 We cannot allow our country to turn into a private corporation,  Ms Tymoshenko said.
 Put simply, that is what Yanukovych wants to do. 
Mr Yushchenko is also taking aim at the treaty.
He may be a spent political force, drawing just 5 per cent of the vote in this year's presidential elections, but he is still lashing out at his former ally, Ms Tymoshenko.
 For her, national interests are of secondary importance,  he said.
 The most important thing for her is to be present in politics. Unfortunately lots of disappointments were brought in via such a model. 
Meanwhile, activist Peetro Antyp says he can recall the time five-and-a-half years ago when hundreds of thousands of people massed in Independence Square in the capital, Kiev.
He remembers the spirit that was in the air, the dreams of a new era for Ukraine.
 The fact is that many issues we were standing for were not solved,  Mr Antyp said.
 Many people were hoping for reforms, but they did not happen. Here, there is a feeling of disappointment. 
After the revolution, corruption was rife and reforms aimed at establishing a transparent government floundered.
Ms Tymoshenko says it is the politicians who failed, not the principles of the revolution.
 People are disillusioned, not in their ideas and ideals, but in the politicians who proved incapable of turning these ideals into reality,  she said.
In the Kiev spring there are few signs of another revolution. Russian navy bases and natural gas prices are controversial.
But many in Ukraine say after watching their campaign for reforms go nowhere, they are in no mood to try again.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,2,"SHANE MCLEOD: Queensland's Treasurer Andrew Fraser says his state will fight any proposal that threatens its burgeoning coal seam gas to LNG industry.
He spoke on the phone from Los Angeles to our Brisbane reporter Annie Guest.
 ANDREW FRASER: Lots of economists, lots of resource companies and lots of tax designers will argue and they are correct that there is a policy case for resource rent taxation; that it can actually be the best form, the most efficient form and a form of taxation for the resource industry that promotes investment.
But one size doesn't fit all and so any move to a resource rent tax that may or may not be in the report that's going to be released on Sunday needs to make sure that it focuses on keeping Australia competitive and promoting investment...
ANNIE GUEST: What has the Treasurer Wayne Swan told you about any additional resources rent tax?
ANDREW FRASER: Not a word. So let me say what's important to Queensland in 2010.
Queensland in 2010 after a lot of effort, a lot of policy work by the State Government, a lot of spade work by the State Government is on the cusp of a $40 billion to $50 billion new industry - coal seam gas to LNG.
And a resource rent tax can have devastating impacts on the LNG industry because it's got a very different capital spend to for instance the offshore work in Western Australia.
And we'll be fighting tooth and nail to make sure the arrangements promote investment in Queensland, let the LNG industry go ahead. And if that needs to mean that there are grandfathering arrangements in place then that's what we will be putting forward.
ANNIE GUEST: Can some mining companies afford to pay more tax? Is it fair enough to levy more tax on some?
ANDREW FRASER: Well I think there's no doubt that the resources boom has been very good for the Australian economy. But there's no doubt it's also been very good for a lot of Australian mining companies.
There is a debate to be had about whether the balance is right between the corporate tax rate overall and what the resources sector is undertaking.
ANNIE GUEST: Would you be supportive if this resources rent tax did have the trade-off of a lesser company tax rate? Would it then be something you would support?
ANDREW FRASER: Well depending on the balance that was put forward then that I think is something that should be considered to promote the overall investment attractiveness of Australia and a globally competitive economy.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"EAST Timor has rejected a proposal by a Woodside-led consortium to export gas from the Timor Sea using what would be one of the world's first floating liquified natural gas platforms, putting the multibillion-dollar Greater Sunrise joint venture in peril.
The rejection came after Woodside and its joint-venture partners, which also include ConocoPhillips, Shell and Osaka Gas, said they had decided to build the controversial platform after rigorous commercial and technical evaluation, which included the options of building onshore at either Darwin or East Timor.
 After meetings that stretched into last night, East Timor government spokesman Agio Pereira repeated the oft-stated position that a pipeline must be built to deliver the gas to East Timor, where it must be processed.
The East Timorese government had said repeatedly it would not approve either a floating platform or a pipeline to Darwin, the only two options the consortium was considering.
Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao last week reportedly said Australia had made threats to East Timor over its stand.
East Timor and Australia will each receive 50 per cent of the royalties.
Giant floating LNG plants carry certain risks given they are yet to be tested anywhere in the world. But the method is being seen as advantageous for smaller projects or for gasfields that are too far from shore.
Analysts say developing Sunrise as a floating LNG project would mean first gas was unlikely until after 2018, with a final investment decision to be made in 2012.
In a statement issued yesterday, Shell was quick to trumpet that Sunrise would be its second floating LNG project; its first is likely to be its Prelude proposal, 500 kilometres from Broome, in the Timor Sea. But first LNG from Prelude has also been delayed to about 2015.
Shell Australia's executive vice-president, upstream, Ann Pickard, said a floating platform for Sunrise made the most sense.
 Sunrise is a significant resource, but is remote and technically challenging, so Shell's FLNG technology provides the best technical and commercial development option,  she said.
Woodside will be the operator of Sunrise and holds a 33.4 per cent interest, while the other partners will have lesser interests â€” ConocoPhillips (30 per cent), Shell (26.6 per cent) and Osaka Gas (10 per cent).
The floating LNG option would produce up to 4 million tonnes of LNG a year along with condensate and LPG.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Woodside Petroleum confirmed yesterday it would use revolutionary floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) technology to develop its Greater Sunrise gas field in the Timor Sea, putting it on a collision course with the East Timor government.
The East Timor government said early this month it would oppose any development that did not involve piping the Greater Sunrise gas to an LNG plant on East Timor soil.
 Woodside chief executive Don Voelte appeared to pre-empt East Timor opposition when announcing the decision, saying the FLNG option met the terms of an agreement signed by the Australian and East Timor governments in 2007 that required the Sunrise partners to develop the field  to best commercial advantage consistent with good oilfield practice .
 We expect that the selection of a floating LNG processing option will, in addition to generating long-term petroleum revenue, provide a broad range of social investment, employment and training opportunities for Timor Leste,  Mr Voelte said, using the Portuguese name for the country.
Once operational, the FLNG project â€“ a joint venture between Woodside, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Osaka Gas â€“ will produce 4 million tonnes a year of LNG as well as condensate.
Neither Woodside nor Shell gave cost estimates for the project, although analysts suggested construction could cost $5 billion.
Shell will operate the facility and manage the design and construction once a final decision is made.
The partners considered processing the gas through ConcoPhillips' existing Darwin LNG facility, or through a new plant in East Timor.
The latter option was eliminated early because a deep ocean trench between the field and East Timor made a pipeline too expensive.
While the unproven nature of FLNG means the project will carry a degree of technical risk, FLNG does stand to offer substantial capital savings over conventional LNG projects due to their potential to service multiple fields and the lack of pipelines linking offshore fields to onshore plants. It can also by-pass time-consuming native title and land-based environmental processes.
The project will be Woodside's first exposure to floating LNG, which is already being pursued in Australia through separate projects run by Shell and French company GDF Suez.
The Sunrise development will involve a specially designed ship capable of hosting the vast amounts of LNG infrastructure traditionally located onshore. The vessel will then be positioned directly over the gas fields, the gas will be super-cooled into a liquid on board and then transferred at sea to special LNG carriers.
The ships will be the largest ever built, with those planned by Shell to be about 480 metres long by 75 metres wide.
Shell has selected the Timor Sea as the home of its first FLNG projects due to the relatively calm waters. The company's first floating venture will be the Prelude development off northern Western Australia.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said there was now a new degree of certainty over Sunrise's eventual development, which has faced scepticism from analysts.
 It just shows Shell's commitment to what they call a game-changing form of technology,  Mr Ramsay said.  If they get it right, and presumably they will, it really does potentially have a dramatic impact on gas fields that aren't quite big enough to support a stand-alone LNG project. 
Meanwhile, US company Hess â€“ Woodside's partner in a major exploration block in the Carnarvon Basin â€“ said on Wednesday night it had not decided how to commercialise its share of gas from the venture and was working with three parties on different options.
If Hess joined Woodside's Pluto LNG project, Woodside would probably have enough committed gas Â­reserves to support a major expansion of the facility.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Petroleum chief Don Voelte says a decision to develop the Greater Sunrise gas fields through a floating liquefied natural gas plant will provide ``a broad range'' of opportunities to East Timor despite the South-East Asian nation opposing the plan.
Woodside yesterday said the Sunrise joint-venture partners had decided that a floating LNG vessel was the best way to process the gas, located in the Timor Sea, ahead of another option to pipe it about 450km to Darwin.
 Shell, which has a 26.6 per cent stake in the project, said it would build and operate the floating LNG facility, which would produce about 4 million tonnes of gas a year.
Earlier this month, a spokesman for the Timor-Leste Government, Secretary of State Agio Pereira, said Woodside's plans would not be approved.
Timorese and Australian regulators will have the final say on the project.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,2,"ENERGY
EAST TIMOR has rejected a plan by a Woodside-led consortium to export gas from a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the multibillion-dollar Greater Sunrise field in the Timor Sea.
 East Timor said the consortium's announcement yesterday that it wanted to build the world's first floating platforms at the field would not be accepted by the fledgling nation  now or in the future .
An East Timorese spokesman, Agio Periera, accused the consortium of an  unacceptable level of arrogance  and said the decision  has significantly compromised future relations with Timor-Leste .
The Secretary of State for Natural Resources, Alfredo Pires, said:  Timor-Leste will not approve or agree to any arrangement which does not include a gas pipeline and LNG plant built onshore in Timor-Leste. 
 Woodside must acknowledge this and not continue to mislead the public,  Mr Pires said.
Mr Pires said East Timor had conducted detailed surveys which confirm the technical and commercial viability of a pipeline to the country, where most people live in poverty.
East Timor's leaders last week accused Australia of threatening the country over its stand on Greater Sunrise. Australia denied making any threats.
Yesterday, the Woodside chief executive, Don Voelte, said the Sunrise joint venture would  continue to work with  Australian and East Timorese authorities.
Giant floating LNG plants carry risks, as they are yet to be tested anywhere in the world. However, the method is being seen as advantageous for smaller projects or for gas fields that are too far from shore.
Analysts said developing Sunrise as a floating LNG project would mean first gas is unlikely until after 2018, with a final investment decision to be made in 2012.
In a statement issued yesterday, Shell was quick to trumpet that Sunrise would be its second floating LNG project; its first is likely to be its Prelude proposal, located 500 kilometres from Broome in the Timor Sea. However, Prelude has also been delayed from the original estimate of some time in 2012 to new forecasts of about 2015.
Ann Pickard, Shell Australia's executive vice-president of upstream, said a floating platform for Sunrise made the most sense:  Sunrise is a significant resource, but is remote and technically challenging.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,2,"Arrow Energy starts drilling at Keerrong
KEERRONG Valley farmer Mick Fields was slightly bemused when Arrow Energy contacted him and said it wanted to test drill for coal seam gas on his rural property.
 â€œThey told me they dropped a pin on a map and it hit my farm,â€? he said. â€œThey said they will be drilling for a couple of weeks and would restore the site for me.â€?
That was about six months ago and last week workmen erected the towering drill surrounded by Brahman bulls and dairy cows.
The exploratory drilling in the pristine rural valley, which has piqued the interest of locals, is one of five test drills across the region, Arrow Energy spokesman Gareth Quinn told The Northern Star.
â€œWe will have two rigs drilling five test sites to the end of the financial year,â€? he said.
â€œItâ€™s not intensive. Itâ€™s a government requirement that we do some work so we donâ€™t lose the rights.â€?
The testing sites form a â€˜horse shoeâ€™ shape and include two holes at Bexhill, four at Geneva, two at Peacock and one at Tunglebung, as well Mr Fieldsâ€™ at Keerrong.
Mr Quinn said while the company was hopeful about finding large gas reserves, even a positive result would not mean mining in the Northern Rivers for the foreseeable future.
â€œOur activity for some time will be concentrated around the Dalby gas field (in Queensland),â€? he said.
Mr Fields said he was happy to see what happens. Since Arrow started preparatory work on his property last Saturday they have put in two new gates and improved the dirt track to the drilling site, and paid him a small amount of money for his troubles.
â€œIâ€™ve got no complaints,â€? he said. â€œThey told me â€˜anything I need just let them knowâ€™ and when I have they have fixed things immediately.â€?
â€œIf they decide to mine it will be a totally different issue because I donâ€™t know what I am up for.â€?

BG Group has announced a 5 per cent slide in profits, as a slump in global natural gas prices offset robust production growth.
 The demerged international arm of British Gas said that net profit in the first three months of the year stood at $US960 million ($1.03 billion), compared with slightly more than $US1bn for the same period last year.
BG has been battling against fierce headwinds in the global gas industry -- a glut in production of unconventional shale gas in the US and falling demand in the economic slowdown have weighed heavily on prices.
BG said that the average price it had received for its gas slipped 17 per cent compared with a year earlier from US44.96c a therm during the first quarter to US37.37c.
The result was also hit by a $US377m charge from the sale of three US power plants. Chief executive Frank Chapman called the announcement a ``good set of operating results''.
The weaker financial performance masked brisk growth in production at BG, which rose by 6 per cent to 61.3 million barrels equivalent, compared with a year ago. The growth was driven by higher volumes in the US, Australia and a big new project in Tunisia.
Mr Chapman added: ``We have continued the strengthening and rebalancing of our global portfolio with the expansion of our US upstream position, which will take our US reserves and resources to around 5 trillion cubic feet.''
Mr Chapman angered shareholders last month amid concerns over his pound stg. 28m ($46.2m) pay package. Yesterday he claimed the pay reflected his performance and said it was a matter for the board's remuneration committee.
Asked if he considered himself an alien for earning such large amounts of money, compared with ordinary UK citizens, Mr Chapman said: ``I am British and I live in the UK, so I don't regard myself as an alien. I can't talk about remuneration as it's all in the remuneration report.''

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,2,"I n the United States oil is gushing from a damaged deep-sea well at a disastrous rate. Eleven workers are missing, presumed dead, following the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig operated in the Gulf of Mexico by oil company BP. The oil is spreading faster than first thought and is threatening hundreds of kilometres of coastline and a multi-billion- dollar fishing industry. Late yesterday an oil slick almost 200kms long was very close to the mouth of the Mississippi River and authorities were scrambling to stop the oil damaging wetlands along the Gulf. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency and President Barack Obama has mobilised federal agencies to help with what could be the United States' worst environmental disaster. The spill follows the announcement of Mr Obama's five-year plan to open new areas to offshore oil and natural gas drilling.
  That surprise announcement was said to be an attempt by Democrats to gain Republican support for the Administration's legislation to combat climate change. Deepwater Horizon was an ultra- deepwater semi-submersible oil rig. Last September it drilled the deepest oil well in history. At its most recent location, 80 km off the southeastern coast of Louisiana, it suffered an explosion and sank, leaving the well
uncapped. This is not yet the worst- ever oil disaster but the trend is alarming, with oil spewing from the ruptured well at more than 750,000 litres a day. The worst unintentional spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 1979. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 involved one tenth of the volume of the 1979 disaster, but it was considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused environmental disasters because it happened in the pristine Prince William Sound in Alaska and the remote location hampered efforts to clean up after the accident. A large oil spill also occurred in the Timor Sea, off Australia's northern coastline, last year. The oil continued to flow from the West Atlas rig for 10 weeks, producing an oil slick over a large area. An inquiry into the spill has been told that the failure of Thai- based operator PTTEP to test a
concrete casing had been identified as the likely cause of the disaster. The latest oil spill in the US must prompt a global review of safety measures for oil drilling and a fundamental rethink of drilling in deep oceans. It appears that the chance of spills is escalating as drillers go after oil deposits that are in deeper and more remote locations and are harder to extract. It is all very well to drill deep, but where were the contingency plans to cope with an accident? When disaster strikes, it is much more difficult to stop the flow and prevent environmental damage. In the case of the West Atlas blow- out, the operators brought in another rig that drilled into the original bore. Mud was used to block the flow of oil. It was a good fix but it took weeks to relocate the second drilling rig and then several attempts over following weeks to make the successful interception below the sea bed. It was welcome news when the ruptured rig was finally capped but the spill on our doorstep brings home the inherent risks of undersea drilling for oil. It is to be hoped that some positives can come out of the latest oil disaster. Governments should impose more scrutiny and tighter safety regulations on drilling operations. Communities should apply pressure for this to happen. And governments, corporations and citizens in every nation should step up their efforts to reduce the world's dependency on oil. An obvious method to move towards that aim is to convert to more fuel-efficient vehicles. That could mean downsizing from large ''family'' sedans, or buying a diesel, hybrid or electric car. Some of these options are out of reach of low- income families. Many Hollywood stars buy hybrids to claim street cred with flimsy green credentials but that option is not open to most Australian motorists. Kevin Rudd's ''working families'' are entitled to ask on what basis the Prime Minister gave $35 million of taxpayers' funds to Toyota to construct the Camry Hybrid when it seems that prices of hybrid cars have not come down from levels that make them unattractive to average families. Overall, as we observe the disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico, it is time to urgently consider the resolutions that should be made for the good of the environment. First the US Government must deal with the environmental calamity on its doorstep, the scale of which is as yet unknown. Then the world must reflect on whether the pursuit of deep-sea oil is worth the cost.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"THE FOREIGN Investment Review Board yesterday approved the $3.5 billion Shell/PetroChina joint bid for Arrow Energy.
The approval, which opens the way for Shell and PetroChina's plan to build a liquefied natural gas plant on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour, could prove a catalyst for what will be China's biggest investment in Australia's resources industry in the next decade. While the Shell/PetroChina LNG plans face competition from BG Group, Santos and Origin Energy, if they proceed they are likely to cost at least $15 billion.
 The decision will go some way to calming fears that Chinese investment in significant resources is unwelcome.
Arrow chief executive Nick Davies said the announcement brought the company ``one step closer to realising significant value for Arrow shareholders''.
Shell and PetroChina welcomed the approval, noting the offer was subject to Arrow shareholder, Australian court and Chinese government approval. Arrow is expected to hold a shareholder meeting in mid-July to vote on the offer.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Report
Just one key hurdle remains before Chinese state-owned energy giant PetroChina can gain a foothold in Australia's expanding coal-seam gas industry after the Foreign Investment Review Board approved its offer for Arrow Energy.
 PetroChina â€“ one of the world's largest companies â€“ and its partner Royal Dutch Shell have lodged a $3.45 billion offer for Arrow, the last of Australia's large independent coal-seam gas players.
The offer was conditional upon FIRB approval, which had shaped as a potential impediment given PetroChina's state-owned status and the fact it is a major buyer of liquefied natural gas.
Under guidelines issued by the FIRB last year, major transactions Â­involving state-owned enterprises, in particular when a customer can gain control of an asset, can come under greater scrutiny.
Shell and PetroChina confirmed the FIRB approval on Friday, describing it as another step towards the pair  being able to invest the funds required to further develop Queensland's coal-seam gas to LNG industry .
Among the few remaining conditions to be satisfied are securing an independent expert's report finding the offer to be in the best interests of Â­Arrow shareholders, as well as the vote on the proposal by Arrow shareholders.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said the scheme meeting of Arrow shareholders on July 14 would be the last key hurdle.
 Given the revised offer and management's efforts to accelerate the development of international projects . . . a negative shareholder vote remains unlikely,  he said.
New Hope Coal, Arrow's major shareholder with a 16.7 per cent stake, has previously said it intends to vote in favour of the Shell-PetroChina offer in the absence of a superior bid.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"HENRY BRISBANE, May 2 AAP - Queensland's fledgling coal seam gas sector could be hurt by the federal government proposed resources tax, the nation's peak petroleum lobby group has warned.
The Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT) is designed to give the public a share of profits more comparable to the early 2000s, before the last mining boom.
 It will tax super profits made from non-renewable resources at 40 per cent from July 1, 2012.
But Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) chief executive Belinda Robinson said this could pose certain challenges for industries such as Queensland's fledgling coal seam gas sector.
 A particular concern is the impact of the new tax on projects at critical stages of planning,  she said on Sunday.
 These include Queensland's liquefied natural gas projects to be developed from coal seam gas and investments in domestic gas projects for the supply of energy to our capital cities. 
Ms Robinson said existing projects subjected to the new regime were likely to be substantially worse off.
 Many of these projects will have incurred very large resource taxation liabilities in their early production lives,  she said.
 The industry notes that there is still a great deal of critical detail and clarification to be developed. 
Ms Robinson said she welcomed the decision to introduce a resource exploration rebate, reduce the corporate tax rate and retain the existing Petroleum Resource Rent Tax regime for existing offshore oil and gas projects.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"FORMER Queensland Gas Company boss Richard Cottee slides his feet under his new Melbourne desk as head of Nexus Energy today with a big challenge ahead of him. But that's exactly what he wants.
A year-and-a-half off after guiding coal-seam gas player QGC into the hands of British gas giant BG Group -- for the tidy sum of $5.7 billion in cash -- has been welcome, but it has been a long enough break.
 ``I had gotten to the stage where I was sick of not doing anything and was probably becoming a difficult father and husband,'' Cottee says. ``There's nothing like a frustrated bull.''
Brisbane is the born-and-bred Queenslander's preferred base, but with the Cottees owning a 121ha farm at Winchelsea near Geelong, and two of his children already at the prestigious Geelong Grammar, Melbourne is a close second.
The fact that he wanted to chase a career outside coal-seam gas also made Brisbane a harder prospect. ``I was really looking for something with a big upside and an improbable degree of getting there,'' he says.
And he might have found the right venture, given the poor fortunes of Nexus at its Longtom gas project in the Gippsland Basin off the coast of Victoria.
Last week, the company had to stop production after Santos, which buys the gas for its Patricia Baleen gas plant, found too much mercury in the gas.
Production -- and all of the Nexus cashflow -- could be out for the next three months.
``Longtom has some issues but I didn't think so at the time I took the job,'' Cottee says.
``I was hoping that Longtom was going to be a good cash stream to allow you to concentrate on the big company-makers, but obviously there's going to be some attention now given back to Longtom.''
He said the ``company-makers'' were the Crux liquid and gas projects in the Browse Basin off the coast of Western Australia and the nearby Echuca Shoals exploration target.
To develop them, Nexus will have to engage with global players -- something it has not yet done.
Despite a long sales process, Nexus has not found a buyer for a stake in Crux since the collapse of a 2008 deal with Mitsui.
``Nexus . . . is going to have to be much more commercially adroit,'' Cottee says.
``You have be faster and stronger because you are dealing with companies that are bigger and hairier than you are.''
Cottee has proved himself in this area.
His generally lauded deal with BG came after Cottee had brought the gas giant in as a partner in a planned Gladstone LNG project, and fought off a $600 million bid from Santos.
Cottee warns investors that Nexus is not going to be an instant turnaround. In fact, he says one of the reasons he has not wanted to get into coal-seam gas is the expectations that would have been placed on him. ``It is good going somewhere where I have a degree of anonymity, so there will be time to build a foundation,'' he says.
``If people think I can create the value in Nexus in the short term, I think they are kidding themselves. At QGC it took me two to three years before it was obvious things had changed.''
Cottee says he is expecting more consolidation in the mid-tier oil and gas sector.Despite having left the QGC offices at the end of 2008, Cottee remained on the BG payroll until last week, acting as a consultant for the firm.
He spent some time travelling, heading to Fiji, and Britain to visit his daughter at Oxford.
He has also spent about a quarter of his time at Winchelsea.
``I've started to fix the farm up. It had been leased out and overgrazed.
``I put on a two-year business plan: crop it for the first year, repair the fences, repair the soil, get the water system right and this year I put in five-year grasses.
``The third year is: put a hell of a lot of sheep and cattle on.''

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"An oil and gas lobby group has warned that Queensland's new coal seam methane gas industry could be severely hampered by a new tax on resources 'super profits'.
The Petroleum Producers and Exploration Association says it's pleased that existing offshore oil and gas projects will remain under the current tax regime, but is concerned new projects won't.
 Existing projects already pay a Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) of 40 per cent, but they're able to claim a lot of deductions on capital costs and expenditure.
APPEA says the super profits tax makes investment in new gas projects much less attractive.
CEO Belinda Robinson says she's worried the viability of billions of dollars worth of new onshore gas projects being planned is under threat.
 They include these massive coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland,  she says.
 It's a fledgling industry, one with massive potential, but one that we know will be substantially adversely affected by this regime.
 Just how much we don't know yet, because there's still a lot of crucial detail to work through, but we do know it will be a much more negative environment that they'll be operating under. 
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"For at least two years, there has been much talk about the obvious potential for consolidation among the four proponents of large-scale liquefied natural gas projects at Gladstone.
But with the final investment decisions expected within a few months on the BG Group and Santos-Petronas projects (Queensland environmental approvals are still pending), none have yet signed a deal to share equity stakes in processing trains.
 Instead, industry sources say the increasing likelihood is that the deals between the parties will focus on sharing infrastructure outside the processing trains, such as pipelines, pipeline crossings, dredging and jetties. For example, it would make sense to build only one pipeline in an area (and possibly have it owned and operated by a third-party such as APA Group) with spurs to particular coal seam gas fields rather than invest capital in building adjacent pipelines.
UBS has estimated it could cost $1 billion to build the needed 400 kilometre pipeline, so sharing the infrastructure would save each company a material amount of money. Briefing US analysts on Friday, Conoco boss Jim Mulva indicated as much, noting at this point co-ordinating capital spending and labour among the projects was more likely than sharing trains or gas sales contracts.
Another area for co-operation is likely to be gas supply, since so many of the fields are held in joint ventures. The Origin Energy-Conoco APLNG joint venture recently agreed to supply BG with gas from a field that is jointly owned.
In a presentation in February, BG indicated it expected third-party gas to supply up to 20 per cent of its LNG production. Victoria Petroleum, a joint venture partner in one of its licences, would appear a likely provider.
The idea of sharing processing trains, while helpful to contractor Bechtel, which is involved with all of the projects, appears less likely at this stage. There are at least two parties already involved in each of the four projects (albeit BG's is different in that CNOOC has only a 10 per cent stake), and joint venture trains between four companies could prove very slow-moving and unwieldy.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"HENRY REVIEW RESOURCES- MINING
The resources sector will be hit with a  super profits  tax as part of a radical overhaul of natural resource charging that seeks to cash in on Asia's burgeoning demand for our coal, iron ore and coal seam gas.
 The federal government plans to introduce a 40Â per cent tax on resources super profits from JulyÂ 2012 and provide a refund to resources companies for state royalties â€“ alleviating concerns about double taxation.
Treasury has estimated the super profits tax will raise $3Â billion in 2012-13 and $9Â billion in 2013-14.
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan said yesterday the reform would position the nation for  commodity boom mark II  and generate a fairer return for the community from Australia's natural resources wealth. The super profits tax will be used to boost superannuation savings, fund company tax rate cuts and invest in infrastructure.
The government tried to soften the blow to the resources sector by emphasising about one-third of the money raised from the new tax would be returned through a new exploration rebate. The government also plans to invest in infrastructure to ease road, rail and port bottlenecks.
Pointedly, the government said its entire tax reform package was  dependent on the successful implementation of the resources super profits tax .
Mr Rudd said taxpayers had forgone $35Â billion in revenue from the resources sector over the past decade, as state royalties had failed to keep pace with miners' profits. Mining profits had risen by $80Â billion in the past 10Â years but revenue from state royalties had increased by just $9Â billion, he said.
The 40Â per cent tax would be payable on profits after extraction and exploration costs had been accounted for. The tax will also be deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
Under the new regime, highly profitable projects will pay more tax and less profitable projects will pay less tax than at present.
Mr Rudd said the government was bracing itself for a scare campaign from the sector over the new tax.  The fear campaign will be large. The fear campaign will be well funded,  Mr Rudd said.
The government also rebuked recent claims by the sector that the new tax would discourage investment.  The RSPT [Resource Super Profits Tax] will only tax super profits. In fact, 60Â per cent of super profits will still be available to investors,  the government said in its policy statement.
The credit for state royalties would be available at least up to the amount of royalties imposed at the time of yesterday's announcement, including scheduled increases already announced by the states.
The government said this would allow the states to continue to collect a stable stream of revenue from royalties, while removing the adverse effects on investment and production.
Existing resource projects will be phased into the new scheme, with the exception of petroleum resource rent tax projects â€“ in their case, optional arrangements would be developed in consultation with industry.
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said there would be a thorough consultation process with the industry and the states this year to work through the details of the new tax, particularly for the transition of existing projects.
 The government will consult closely on the establishment of the infrastructure fund and the arrangements for rebating state royalties,  Mr Ferguson said.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"QUEENSLAND'S coal seam gas sector, the darling of the resources sector, could come crashing back to earth. Analysts expect it to be one of the hardest hit under the federal government's resource super profits tax.
John Hirjee, of Deutsche Bank, said coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas could be the biggest loser from the proposed changes.
 He said the new tax regime might reduce the net present value of Santos's and Origin's planned projects in Gladstone by as much as 40 per cent. The tax might also add to the risks associated with unconventional LNG projects and dissuade international buyers.
 We believe Santos and Origin are the most at risk as we see their Gladstone LNG and Australia Pacific LNG projects as losers from a [resource super profits tax],  Mr Hirjee said.  Arrow Energy is also highly exposed to the CSG sector but remains under a takeover bid from Shell/PetroChina. With a 14-month consultation process prior to a possible July 1, 2012, implementation date, the CSG to LNG sector will face further short-term uncertainty. 
Belinda Robinson, chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said its modelling presented a similarly grim scenario.
 There is no doubt it will be negative for the sector at a time when none of these projects have gone to final investment decision and some are seeking investment partners,  she said.
Ms Robinson said it was critical that if the tax did apply that it be calculated as close to the extraction point as possible.
Figures from Deutsche showed that an upstream tax would alter its estimates of net asset value on Santos's GLNG project by 9 per cent and the company as a whole by 2.7 per cent.
However, an integrated tax scenario, calculated after processing, when the gas was worth much more, would hit GLNG by 40 per cent and Santos by 11.6 per cent.
 We note that the current petroleum resource rent tax regime effectively takes the upstream approach,  Deutsche said.
Backing the case that investment could go offshore as a result of the resource super profits tax, companies judged winners under the new regime are those with projects overseas, such as Woodside Petroleum.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ANALYSTS have warned that federal tax reforms could threaten the viability of Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas industry.
The state expects great benefits from its four major CSG projects, including up to 18,000 new jobs, investment of $40 billion, an increase of $3bn in gross state product, and $850 million in royalties a year.
 But according to analysis by Deutsche Bank, CSG projects will be the potential biggest losers from any 40 per cent tax on resources profits.
``We believe a resource super profits tax could have a material impact on the economic viability of proposed CSG to LNG projects,'' the report says.
It estimated the Origin Energy and Santos projects were most at risk, and could suffer a decline in their net value of up to 40 per cent.
In its analysis of Origin's prospects, Citigroup says the tax review has ``given rise to more questions than answers''.
``There is undoubtedly more uncertainty on the value of proposed CSG to LNG projects,'' Citigroup says.
Santos's Matt Doman said: ``You can't take $9bn a year out of the industry and expect there to be no negative impact on jobs.''
Origin's Tim Scott said the reforms were ``very complex'' but would not comment on the experts' analysis.
BG Group spokesman Mark Todd said the proposed reforms did not change his company's commitment to pushing ahead with its Queensland Curtis CSG project.
Deutsche Bank said Arrow Energy was highly exposed to the CSG sector, but that it remained under a takeover offer from Shell and PetroChina.
However, the report says Australia's energy sector would be generally stronger from the Henry reforms.
``Caltex and Oil Search have no operations that could be subject to an RSPT, and Caltex would benefit from lower corporate tax rates,'' the analysis says.
The report names Woodside as ``potentially the biggest winner'', partly because it has no onshore Australian operations.
Arrow Energy could not be reached for comment.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"LNG - HENRY TAX REVIEW
Queensland's coal seam gas sector is shaping as the major test of the federal government's proposed resources tax, with fears mounting it could defer billions of dollars worth of investment.
 Three coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas projects are due to receive final approval by their owners this year. Analysts warned yesterday that the planned 40 per cent tax on resources profits could push back schedules to approve the projects.
Each is likely to cost about $15 billion, proving a big boost to the Queensland economy and thousands of well-paid jobs.
Adelaide-based Santos had expected to approve its Gladstone LNG project by mid-year, while London's BG Group has a similar timeframe for approval of its Queensland Curtis LNG development. Origin Energy and its partner ConocoPhillips had been working towards a decision by the end of the year on their Australia Pacific LNG project.
Pengana Capital portfolio manager Tim Schroeders said the projects' investment decisions were all but certain to be deferred.
 The coal seam gas to LNG guys are probably on the bus to Canberra as we speak,  Mr Schroeders said.  I would imagine the impact of this is going to be fairly devastating for these projects. 
The resources industry will consult with government in the lead-up to the implementation of the tax in mid-2012, meaning uncertainty could linger for up to two years.
The coal seam gas industry was previously expected to pay a royalty to the Queensland government on production, representing a tax of 8 to 10 per cent of the gas value at production. Under the tax changes, that royalty will be absorbed into the new 40 per cent super tax.
Outside coal seam gas, most of Australia's oil and gas companies are largely immune to the changes.
Offshore operations such as those of Woodside Petroleum are already mostly subject to the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax, which has a similar structure to the new resource tax. Other Australian-listed companies such as Oil Search have their operations outside Australia.
The proposed changes come at a sensitive time in the development of the coal seam gas industry, with both Santos and Origin trying to secure long-term customers and project partners for their developments.
Citigroup analyst Marie Miyashiro said the proposed tax  without a doubt  introduced uncertainty to the economics of Origin's LNG project.
 At the very least, the lack of certainty on the extent to which this review may indeed be legislated will likely stall investment decisions,  Ms Miyashiro said.  Near term, this may affect APLNG's negotiations with potential LNG buyers. 
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the coal seam gas projects had already been fighting concerns from prospective customers over the quality of LNG from coal seam gas, and said the looming tax slug could be enough to deter buyers.
JPMorgan analyst Benjamin Wilson said BG and Santos could defer their decisions.  Foreign companies including BG, Shell, Petronas, ConocoPhillips and PetroChina have spent many billions acquiring assets in Queensland and will be understandably concerned about this latest change to Australia's petroleum fiscal environment,  he said in a note.
Mr Wilson said the new tax could even constitute a condition that could allow Shell and PetroChina to walk away from their joint $3.45 billion bid for coal seam gas company Arrow Energy.
Origin spokeswoman Lina Melero said the company was reviewing the implications of the changes.
 The policy as announced leaves a number of points still unclear, such as the definition of existing projects and the lack of clarity regarding the point of taxation and calculations,  she said.
BG spokesman Mark Todd said the company was assessing the impact of the new regime but the company remained committed to the project.
Neither Santos nor Shell commented on the tax changes yesterday.
Shares in Santos and Origin fell by 4.6 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively yesterday, while Woodside and Oil Search shares gained 0.4 per cent and 0.35 per cent respectively.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE Rudd government's plan to tax resource profits has wiped about $2 billion from the market value of the nation's burgeoning coal-seam gas sector, as billions of dollars of investment in the Prime Minister's home state of Queensland is threatened.
In the first two trading days since the Sunday revelation Canberra planned to slug a 40 per cent tax on resource profits, coal-seam gas stocks have tumbled.
 More than $20bn of planned CSG to liquefied natural gas plants are planned at the port of Gladstone as oil majors and local companies rush to export gas from the Surat and Bowen basins.
Yesterday, CSG stocks continued a fall that started Monday.
Origin Energy fell 3.5 per cent, adding to a 1.5 per cent fall the previous day, while Santos fell 2.6 per cent, adding to a 4.6 per cent drop on Monday.
Smaller players, Eastern Star Gas and Bow Energy, were hit hardest, falling 14 per cent and 12 per cent respectively yesterday.
In contrast, Woodside Petroleum, whose operations are covered by the existing Petroleum Resources Rent Tax and which may not to be hit by the new tax, has fallen just 0.4 per cent this week. ``A resource super-profits tax could have a material impact on the economic viability of proposed CSG to LNG projects,'' Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"HENRY CANBERRA, May 6 AAP - Treasurer Wayne Swan has criticised Origin Energy over comments the federal government's proposed super-profits tax could delay and increase costs of a $35 billion liquefied natural gas project.
Origin chief Grant King on Wednesday said the tax was really a levy on normal profits.
  The proposal introduces substantial uncertainty that will make it difficult for new projects to proceed,  Mr King said.
Mr Swan questioned the comments, saying the company had not taken part in any discussions about the proposed 40 per cent tax on the profits of big mining.
 I note Origin Energy out there yesterday and in the papers this morning making claims that their projects would be delayed or at risk,  he said.
Origin Energy had not registered with the Resource Tax Consultation Panel to discuss the impact on its business before the company went public, Mr Swan said.
Shareholders should also question the company's comments and the potential for them to impact on share prices.
 Now if I were a shareholder in that company, I'd want to know why that was the case - why a company would be out there making comments that might hurt the share price, but not have engaged in the process put in place from the second the embargo was lifted on Sunday afternoon,  Mr Swan said.
 I'd particularly want to know why, given that something like 80 other companies had. 
Other companies have also reportedly shelved major projects in wake of the announcement by the government of its proposed tax, including Rio Tinto.
Rio has since denied reports it was planning to shelve plans to spend $11 billion on expanding its massive iron ore operations in Western Australia.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"HENRY CANBERRA, May 6 AAP - Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says threats are standard from mining companies, which are accused of  crying wolf  with claims a planned resources tax puts their projects in peril.
Resource companies are furious about the plan, with one of them, Origin Energy, claiming the tax jeopardises a $35 billion liquefied natural gas project in central Queensland.
 But Rio Tinto has denied reports it was considering shelving plans to spend $11 billion on expanding its iron ore operations in Western Australia due to the tax, announced on Sunday.
Mr Rudd on Thursday said it would create a fairer system - with $1 in every $3 of mining profits returned to the Australian people through taxes, instead of $1 in $7 as it is now.
He welcomed the support of former Reserve Bank boss Bernie Fraser, who has backed the proposal as  very much in the national interest .
 Inevitably, (Mr Fraser) said, there's going to be some crying wolf in all of this,  Mr Rudd told reporters in Victoria.
 So I imagine that some within the mining industry will dig deep within their very deep pockets and seek to run a political campaign. 
The government would not be deterred  one bit  and threats and warnings of project closures were inevitable.
 That's the way in which negotiations with mining companies usually happen,  Mr Rudd said.
The opposition has confirmed it will vote against the 40 per cent tax on mining profits if Labor wins the next federal election.
Finance spokesman Andrew Robb said his party would  absolutely  vote against the tax, but believed it was such a bad plan, it would be scrapped before then.
 This will be exposed for what it is,  he told ABC Radio on Thursday.
 This is going to blow up in the prime minister's face. 
But Mr Rudd said Opposition Leader Tony Abbott should think carefully, as blocking the tax would stop a superannuation changes flowing to workers, and tax breaks benefiting businesses.
 If Mr Abbott blocks these reforms he's standing in the way of, and blocking, better super for working Australians for their retirement and decent tax breaks for 2.4 million Australian businesses,  he said.

BOC said on Thursday that its existing air separation unit and LNG facilities would undergo a $65 million expansion and refurbishment to be completed in mid-2012.
 BOC managing director of the South Pacific, Colin Isaac, said the expansion would support the opening of a network of LNG refueling stations for heavy road transport vehicles along Australia's eastern seaboard.
The network will be use fuel processed from BOC's micro LNG plant at Chinchilla in Queensland as well as LNG from the Dandenong plant.
The expanded Dandenong plant will produce up to 100 tonnes of LNG per day.

However, despite the what Santos said was a lack of clarity on the issue, the company is close to announcing a new customer for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) joint venture in Queensland with Malaysia's Petronas.
 The proposed super tax on resource company profits has been noticed on a global stage, said chief executive David Knox.
 I think with this new change in tax there'll be people outside Australia who'll be asking questions, , Mr Knox told journalists after the company's annual general meeting in Adelaide.
Santos chairman Peter Coates said the proposed super tax affected the stability of the company's  fiscal regime .

 We will be arguing vigorously against both the rationale and the fairness of the government's proposals.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"News
QUEENSLAND'S much-vaunted $100 billion liquefied natural gas investment boom faces being delayed by the federal government's proposed 40 per cent resource rent tax.
 The warning came yesterday from Origin Energy, a partner with US group ConocoPhillips in the $35 billion Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) project â€” one of four proposed for Queensland-based coal seam gas, a new export industry for Australia.
Origin managing director Grant King told a private Macquarie investor briefing in Sydney that the proposed tax had  introduced significant additional cost to APLNG  and that  uncertainty attached to this tax could affect the project schedule , according to presentation material lodged with the stock exchange.
And in private briefings to investors in Melbourne, Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals warned it now faced a bigger task in securing Chinese financing for its planned $10.8 billion expansion in the Pilbara. The Melbourne briefings by Fortescue were led by its chief financial officer, Stephen Pearce.
The potential for cost increases and timing delays at the APLNG project makes it the first of the proposed mega-projects to admit that the planned tax had changed the ground rules for the investment boom Queensland has been banking on.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has said she would be concerned  if these new tax arrangements ultimately end up as a disincentive for more investment . And the Minerals Council of Australia has warned that a cloud is now hanging over as much as $108 billion in potential new mineral projects.
Mr King said the main effect of the proposed tax would be on the coal seam gas (CSG) used by the project. At present, CSG is covered by state royalties but it gets swept under the higher tax regime being proposed.
The APLNG partners are the least advanced of the competing projects in Queensland and were due to make a final investment decision by the end of the year and make first shipments in late 2014.
The other proposed Queensland LNG projects have yet to concede changes to their planned development timetables.
The other projects are those being advanced by Santos/Petronas, Shell/PetroChina and one by BG Group.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ORIGIN Energy has announced that the Rudd government's proposed resource profit tax could delay and significantly increase the costs of a $35 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project it is planning with oil major ConocoPhillips.
Resource industry opposition to the federal government's response to the Henry tax review continued to bubble to the surface yesterday.
 In an internal memo to staff, Rio Tinto chided the government for suggesting the mining industry did not pay its way and that profits flowed out of the nation.
And BHP Billiton metallurgical coal boss Hubie van Dalsen said the company's coking-coal expansion projects were now under review.
Speaking at an investor conference in Sydney yesterday, Origin chief Grant King said the government's proposed resource super-profits tax was misnamed, as it was really a tax on normal profits.
``The proposal introduces substantial uncertainty that will make it difficult for new projects to proceed,'' Mr King said.
Rio Australia managing director David Peever took issue with the government's notion that miners had not paid their fair share of tax.
``Suggestions that the Australian community is not extracting a fair return from the mining sector are unfounded,'' Mr Peever said in an email to Rio staff. ``In 2008-09, the mining sector contributed 18 per cent of corporate income tax revenue while only making up 8 per cent of the economy.''
Fortescue Metals Group chief executive Andrew Forrest has said a resources rent tax could force miners to look overseas for funding new projects, because they would not be able to reinvest cash they otherwise would have.
In a rare interview on Tuesday night, Foreign Investment Review Board chairman John Phillips expanded on the government's process for approving foreign investment by state-owned enterprises, which has been criticised as opaque.
Mr Phillips said the FIRB's policy was to ensure the enterprise was acting as a commercial enterprise and not pursuing commercial objectives.
``Most of these sovereign funds have been operating for quite a while now and you can get a fair idea of how they operate,'' he said.
Mr Phillips said that in the FIRB's previously stated preference for state-owned entities to own less than 15 per cent of major Australian resource companies, the concept of ``major'' could vary, depending on the type of resource.
``There are some resources which are very scarce resources throughout the world, where any investment would be regarded as a major investment,'' he said, citing rare earths.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Origin Energy's $35Â billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project in Queensland could become a casualty of the Rudd government's new Â­resource super profits tax, with Origin managing director Grant King warning yesterday that the project could be delayed.
Speaking at a conference in Sydney, Mr King said the proposed tax would have a  significant negative Â­impact  on the value of all resource projects, including Origin's 50Â per cent-owned APLNG project.
 Origin and its partner, ConocoÂ­Phillips, were aiming to make a final decision by the end of the year on whether to build the project's first train, or processing line.
The project would see Origin's vast Queensland coal seam gas reserves piped to a special facility at Gladstone in central Queensland, where the gas would be converted into LNG for Â­export into higher-priced markets in Asia.
Origin and ConocoPhillips have said they could spend up to $35Â billion on up to four LNG trains at the site.
 The RSPT has introduced significant additional cost to [the project] and uncertainty attached to this tax could affect the project schedule,  Mr King said.
He also criticised the name of the new tax, arguing that it was a tax on normal profits rather than  super  profits. He said it was unclear how the tax would work in practice, what would be defined as a project, whether the tax would be applied at the point where the gas was extracted or when it was shipped as LNG, and capital Â­depreciation rates.
Analysts at UBS and Goldman Sachs JBWere calculated the RSPT could shave about $2Â off the value of Origin shares.
The RSPT is the second recent regulatory blow to Origin, following the government's decision to shelve the emissions trading scheme. Origin had advocated the introduction of a carbon price to encourage a shift away from coal-fired power stations.
Mr King said the lack of a carbon price meant new gas-fired power generation capacity was unlikely to be built to replace higher-emissions coal-fired power. In addition, the RSPT was likely to increase energy prices for consumers.
Coal seam gas-to-LNG projects such as Australia Pacific LNG stand to be particularly hard hit among Australia's resource projects. Such projects previously qualified for a royalty payment of about 10Â per cent, which will be replaced by the RSPT's 40Â per cent tax on profits generated above the long-term bond rate.
However, all companies should benefit from a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 30Â per cent to 28Â per cent. The government needs to enact legislation to implement the tax.
Other planned LNG projects in Australia are already subject to the Â­Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, which is also a 40Â per cent tax rate but has more generous concessions on the Â­recouping of capital expenditure.
Coal seam gas projects also carry higher ongoing operating costs than LNG projects fed by conventional gas sources due to the higher number of wells required to produce gas.
The introduction of the RSPT comes at a sensitive time for Australia's coal seam gas companies, with Origin and Adelaide-based Santos both trying to secure long-term customers for projects.
Santos, which planned to approve its Gladstone LNG project by mid-year, said only that it is assessing the impact of the new tax. Santos chief David Knox was expected to address the issue in greater detail at the company's annual general meeting today.
There has also been mounting speculation that energy giants Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina may reassess their $3.45Â billion bid for coal seam gas company Arrow Energyin light of the new tax, with shares in Â­Arrow falling as much as 10Â per cent this week as a result.
Shell spokesman Phil Connole Â­declined to comment on the Arrow Â­offer, but acknowledged the company was assessing the new tax.  There is no doubt the tax review and particularly the resource super profit tax will have a significant impact on the Australian resource industry,  Mr Connole said.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said the tax was unlikely to unsettle the Shell-PetroChina bid.  It is hard to conceive, in the enormous amounts of due diligence Shell would have done, the potential for the RSPT would not have been considered,  she said.
Arrow investors are scheduled to vote on the takeover offer in mid-July.
Yesterday Origin shares closed up 8Â¢ to $15.64, Santos gained 5Â¢ to $12.91, while Arrow was down 3Â¢Â to $4.84.
KEY POINTS Origin Energy's Grant King warns their $35bn LNG project may be delayed because of the RSPT. Santos is still assessing the impact of the new resource tax. A bid for Arrow may be in jeopardy.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"HENRY BRISBANE, May 7 AAP - The Queensland opposition says the Rudd government's new resources tax puts the state's fledgling coal seam gas industry in jeopardy.
The federal government plans to impose a 40 per cent tax on mining firms' so-called  super  profits.
 Oil and gas producer Santos has told shareholders that the company is considering the tax's impact on its flagship liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone.
The $7.7 billion Gladstone LNG joint venture with Malaysia's Petronas is a two-train LNG project that will take coal seam gas from eastern Queensland, liquefy it at a plant at Gladstone and export it to Asian customers.
But the company said it would  use the next few months to carefully consider the government's tax changes announced on the weekend, including seeking clarity from the government regarding important details not included in Sunday's announcement .
Queensland opposition mines spokesman Jeff Seeney said on Friday Santos's position threw into doubt the future of the industry.
 Now all the anticipated development in central Queensland is in doubt - all the jobs and all the export income that will come from the huge industrial development of this new export industry have now been delayed at best, and at worst, lost all together,  Mr Seeney said.
 They are all re-examining their financial models to determine how their projects can proceed under the burden of a new super tax.

 They have abandoned the Queensland industry and the Queensland economy to the ravages of the Rudd super tax,  he said.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"THE regulator of East Timor's petroleum industry has accused Woodside of failing to comply with its legal obligations before announcing plans to build a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the Timor Sea's Greater Sunrise field.
In a confidential letter seen by BusinessDay, the independent National Petroleum Authority criticised Woodside for failing to provide regulators with detailed reports and its findings on all three possible development plans for the field before deciding on the floating platform.
 East Timor's leaders have repeatedly demanded the gas be piped to a processing plant in East Timor and say they will not approve either a floating platform or piping the gas to Darwin, which the Woodside-led consortium also considered.
As accusations swirl around the multibillion-dollar joint venture, East Timor's Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmao, refused to meet Woodside chief executive Don Voelte in Dili yesterday, saying he would not compromise the  integrity  of  negotiation mechanisms .
A group of about 200 protesters prevented Mr Voelte (pictured right) and representatives of the other joint-venture partners from leaving Dili's VIP airport lounge for almost two hours yesterday.
After the tense standoff, the group was eventually allowed to leave for a meeting with East Timor's President, Jose Ramos Horta, who has asked for briefings on the project.
 We wanted Mr Voelte and his party to know that Timorese demand the gas be piped to East Timor to promote our economic growth and jobs,  said Vincente Mauboci, the group's spokesman.
In a confidential letter dated May 4, Mr Gusmao told Mr Voelte he was  surprised  by the company's announcement about a floating platform and said he was convinced  there must have been a wrongful interpretation  of the Greater Sunrise agreement.
Comments by Mr Gusmao and other East Timorese political leaders about Greater Sunrise have fuelled nationalist sentiment in the nation of 1 million people.
Some influential Timorese believe that development of the field should be delayed and say the government in Dili should not be afraid of walking away from the deal in which East Timor and Australia would equally share $US40 billion ($A44 billion) in revenue.
East Timor is debt free and has almost $US6 billion of oil and gas revenue invested in the US, which is increasing by $US100 million a month.
But local institutions lack the capacity to provide the services and infrastructure needed to lift the majority of Timorese from poverty.
In his letter to Mr Voelte, Mr Gusmao, a former guerilla commander and revolutionary hero, challenged Woodside's pledge that building a floating platform would boost Timorese employment and training skills.
 As far as we know, from 2002 until now, there have only been seven Timorese officers working as trainees in ConocoPhillips,  Mr Gusmao said, referring to Woodside's consortium partner.
 This suggests to us that the best we can look forward to under your concept is having another seven Timorese working with you.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"A NETWORK of liquefied natural gas refuelling stations will be built along Australia's east coast under a deal worth an estimated $400 million over 17 years.
Gas infrastructure company APA Group will supply gas to BOC, which will spend $65 million upgrading its gas facility in Dandenong. It will also spend about $200 million building eight refuelling stations from Melbourne to Brisbane from 2012.
 The expanded plant will produce up to 100 tonnes of LNG a day for the merchant market and a further 50 tonnes a day for heavy vehicles and the refuelling stations.
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson urged the transport sector to switch from diesel to LNG, a move he said would save money and greenhouse gas emissions.
 From the north and from the south, the transport industry will have more options for refuelling through a network of stations and trucks converted to run on LNG,  he said.  I simply say to the transport industry that you should take the lead with respect to the availability of these refuelling stations to think about how they fuel their fleets in the future.
 With around 10 million vehicles worldwide fuelled by natural gas, a network of refuelling stations can be a model for others to follow. 
In March, BG Group's QGC signed a $100 million deal with BOC to supply coal seam gas to a new processing plant in Queensland for conversion to LNG for the trucking industry.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"GAS producer Santos has joined the revolt by big mining against the Rudd government's resource super-profits tax, deferring for up to six months a decision on whether to build a $15 billion LNG export terminal in Gladstone.
Santos's announcement sent shockwaves through the eastern Queensland industrial centre and cast a shadow over the emerging coal-seam gas sector, a vastly promising export earner.
 Another player in the Queensland gas fields, Origin Energy, was reassessing its development plans because of the new tax. Two other proponents of coal-seam gas-based LNG projects in Queensland, the British-based BG Group and Arrow-Shell, have also stated that they are reviewing the status of projects.
The announcements came as mining giant Rio Tinto yesterday confirmed that it was reviewing all its Australian projects, including an $11bn Pilbara expansion plan, while it assessed the potential impact of the government's resource super-profits tax.
Rio Tinto iron ore chief executive Sam Walsh said on Wednesday that the company's plans were ``on hold'' while Rio assessed the impact of the tax and could remain on hold for 12 months.
Concerns about the proposed resources super-profits tax and suggestions the Rudd government may next turn its attention to the banking sector conspired to slash $28 billion from the Australian market yesterday -- its biggest hit this week.
As Rio's share price slumped a further 3.8 per cent yesterday, bringing losses for the week to almost 10 per cent, the company said it had not decided to ``shelve'' any planned projects, as reported in The Australian yesterday. But the company was forced to clarify its position, saying: ``Rio Tinto is reviewing the potential impact of

the proposed RSPT on all of its operations and new projects in Australia.''
Three of the four Queensland gas projects now in limbo were due to make final investment decisions this year. One of the industry's major concerns is the lack of certainty about the exact point in the production process where the new tax will be levied.
Industry sources say there is a big difference in the value of coal-seam gas coming out of the ground and liquefied natural gas, which has been through a freezing and refining process and is about to be exported.
Santos was due to make a final investment decision on the future of the LNG plant by July, but chief executive David Knox said after the company's annual general meeting in Adelaide yesterday that a decision would be pushed back to later in the year.
``I will make that decision in light of all the risks we face,'' Mr Knox said.
``There are a number of risks which are associated with any project of this scale and obviously on Sunday afternoon, with the announced income tax, this is an additional risk which I am going to have to address and fully understand before I can come to a decision.
``We've said we'll make the investment decision mid-year; what we're now saying is that we'll make the decision this year.''
Mr Knox said there was no revision to the anticipated 2014 start date for the first gas.
Mr Knox warned that the mining profits tax was becoming a damaging international issue.
``It has been noticed on a global stage,'' Mr Knox said.
``There will be people outside Australia who will be asking questions.''
The Queensland government is relying on the development of the LNG industry to help it regain its AAA credit rating, as the industry is forecast to create 18,000 jobs and pay the government nearly $1bn each year in royalties.
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said the government's priority was to secure the LNG industry investment, and a lot of work was needed on the ``design'' of the tax.
``But there's no question that when you change the arrangements of course it's going to create issues, of course it's going to create uncertainty,'' Mr Fraser said.
Wayne Swan said that Origin Energy had not registered with the Resource Tax Consultation Panel to discuss the impact on its business before the company went public with its criticisms, and said that shareholders should question the impact on share prices.
``Now if I were a shareholder in that company, I'd want to know why that was the case, why a company would be out there making comments that might hurt the share price, but not have engaged in the process put in place from the second the embargo was lifted on Sunday afternoon,'' the Treasurer said. ``I'd particularly want to know why, given that something like 80 other companies had.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"SANTOS expects to soon name a buyer for a 9 per cent equity stake in the company's cornerstone liquefied natural gas project in Gladstone.
But it has extended its target for a final investment decision beyond the middle of the calendar year.
 ``I am confident of being able to make an announcement on this (buyer) shortly,'' chief executive David Knox said yesterday at Santos's annual general meeting.
Santos was also in ``advanced discussions'' with more potential buyers of the LNG.
There was ``really good progress'' on the project, which is already underpinned by a binding offtake agreement with partner Petronas for 2 million tonnes a year of gas, with an option for 1 million more.
The GLNG project was still on schedule for first gas in 2014, although the target of mid-2010 to make a final investment decision had slipped to ``this year'', Mr Knox said. Denying this was a delay, he attributed the slippage partly to uncertainty over the Federal Government's resources super profits tax proposal. Santos is still awaiting the response by the Queensland Government to the environmental impact statement on the project.
Mr Knox said the State Government was at ``the late stages'' of assessing the EIS but once that passed it would take two to three months to obtain federal approval before a proposition could be put to the Santos board. Clouding the process was uncertainty over the Federal Government's new resources super profits tax.
Chairman Peter Coates said the board would be unable to make a decision until the fiscal situation was clear.
Under the 2008 deal for its 40 per cent stake, Petronas paid $2.1 billion and will pay another $520 million when a second LNG train at Gladstone is sanctioned.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"A $200 million network of fuelling stations along the east coast of Australia will aim to grow the use of liquefied natural gas to power long-haul trucking fleets. The initiative could open a major market for the country's growing unconventional gas Â­resources.
BOC, a subsidiary of German company The Linde Group, announced yesterday plans for a $65 million expansion and refurbishment of its small-scale LNG facilities in Victoria, part of its plans to grow the use of LNG as a transport fuel.
 With Sydney-based APA Group, BOC plans to ultimately install a network of LNG refuelling stations between Melbourne and Brisbane and develop the domestic LNG market.
LNG is used in a handful of transport fleets in Victoria and Western Australia, and BOC says the fuel is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than diesel fuel.
 In Australia, we've got such enormous reserves of natural gas, and we will be converting that into a fuel that can support industry,  BOC managing director South PacificColin Isaac said.  Converting that gas into a fuel that's locally produced, as opposed to importing diesel, makes a lot of sense. 
The upgrade to the Victorian plant coincides with BOC's decision to build a similar small-scale LNG plant in Queensland. BOC signed an agreement earlier this year with London's BG Group, under which it will source coal seam gas from BG's Queensland operations for conversion to LNG.
The Victorian and Queensland LNG facilities should produce 100 tonnes a day of LNG, enough to support about 250 vehicles.
Existing vehicles can be modified to run on LNG, while BOC is hopeful that a rising proportion of vehicles brought into Australia will be LNG-ready. Dual-fuel vehicles that can run on both diesel and LNG are available in Europe and North America.
Mr Isaac said BOC had signed memoranda of understanding to supply LNG to several fleet owners.
 It's been a little difficult for them to commit as we've needed to demonstrate to them that we've got the capacity to provide them with uninterrupted supply,  Mr Isaac said.  Now we've got the facilities, this is a major step in building confidence for them that we're in this game for good. 
The rise of unconventional gas resources in eastern Australia, such as coal seam gas and shale gas, has led to calls for more use of LNG for transport. Beach Energy, which is expanding in shale gas, has flagged transport as a key potential market.
Wilson HTM analyst John Young has talked up the prospects of transport becoming a market for Australia's gas. He says LNG used for transport here could potentially attract a better price than LNG shipped overseas for use in power generation. It could also cut dependence on imported diesel.
 If you look at Australia's energy self-sufficiency, we've got a growing requirement for petrol and diesel and a diminishing level of oil production,  he said.  It's peaked, it's on the way down, and over the next 30 to 40 years you end up with a significant shortfall. 
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson, who attended yesterday's announcement, said the use of LNG for transport would improve Australia's energy security and potentially reduce urban air pollution.
 Competition is always good for business and LNG is really the first alternative to diesel for the heavy transport sector,  Mr Ferguson said.  If more engines can be optimised to run on natural gas, contracts such as this one could spur many more. 
LNG for transport enjoyed a brief surge in popularity in New Zealand in the 1980s, but the industry petered out after the government removed economic incentives.
KEY POINTS BOC will buy coal seam gas from BG's Queensland operations. It has signed MOUs to supply LNG to several fleet owners.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Santos has joined Origin Energy in deferring a decision on a planned multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas project in Queensland due to the Rudd government's new resource super profits tax.
The oil and gas producer says it will now make a final decision on its $7.7Â billion Gladstone LNG project with Malaysia's Petronas  this year  rather than its original mid-year target.
 Despite the potential six-month revision to its timetable, the company has also emphasised it is close to clinching a supply deal to an Asian customer and still expects to meet its first LNG target of 2014.
Speaking at the company's annual general meeting in Adelaide yesterday, chief executive David Knox said Santos needed more time to understand the impact of the Henry review.
 We will make a final investment decision this year,  Mr Knox said.  This will allow us to use the next few months to carefully consider the government's tax changes announced on the weekend, including seeking clarity from the government regarding important details not included in Sunday's announcement,  he said.
Mr Knox confirmed Santos is close to announcing the terms of a supply deal and potential equity stake with an Asian LNG buyer for the GLNG project.
 We've made very good progress on GLNG,  he said.  We're in active negotiations with a number of Asian LNG buyers, so I'm hoping we'll be able to announce something shortly. 
On Wednesday Origin Energy said the proposed tax would have a  significant negative impact  on the value of all resource projects, including Origin's 50Â per cent-owned APLNG project in Queensland.
Santos chairman Peter Coates said the company would work with the government to  improve the new tax proposals and will take time to look at the detail, including tax rates .
Deutsche Bank said it expected to receive fresh capital expenditure guidance for GLNG  shortly  given strong progress on the engineering and design phase of the project.
The announcement of the new tax has arrived at a delicate period for Santos and Origin, which are both seeking long-term Asian customers for their LNG projects.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Queensland Premier Anna Bligh is the latest to express concern about the Government's super tax, saying she wants changes to protect the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector.
The Federal Government had condemned the mining sector for being hysterical about its new mining tax.
 Western Australia's Liberal Premier does not like it either. But Anna Bligh is the first Labor Leader to publicly question the Prime Minister's super tax.
Fresh from a trip overseas, the Premier revealed her deep concern with the mining tax, and says she will need changes to support it.
She says LNG projects in Queensland must be protected.
 I don't think you can treat an industry that is just barely getting on its feet, like LNG, in the same way as you can treat a company that's been in operation for 20, 30 or 40 years,  she said.
 There's got to be some support for new industries in this.
 I'll be talking directly with the Prime Minister and the Federal Treasurer. 
The Federal Government says it wants to see the Queensland Premier's comments in full before it responds.
But it is no wonder she is worried: this week gas producer Santos announced it would be deferring a decision on whether to build a $15 billion LNG export terminal in Gladstone in Queensland.
The Federal Opposition has also attacked the proposed new tax, saying it is indicative of a government addicted to taxing.
The Liberal Party State Council in Western Australia has unanimously opposed the super profits tax, saying it will harm the mining industry.
Deputy Opposition Leader Julie Bishop says the tax is akin to communism.
 I think Kevin Rudd has no convictions, no courage and no credibility,  she said.
The Minerals Council of Australia represents mining giants like BHP Billiton and is fighting the tax.
 The premier, of course, being at the coalface, if you'll excuse the pun, of what happens, knows only too well what will be the impact on the mums and dads shareholders, but the superannuants,  said its chief executive, Mitch Hooke.
 I think the pressure is essentially of the Government's own making. It could have sat down and consulted with industry. 
He says in the 20 years he has worked in Canberra as a chief executive, he cannot remember seeing such an industry so galvanised around one issue.
 It's not a protest about a tax take; it's a protest about a tax grab,  he said.
Mr Hooke ruled out a marginal seats campaign that would aim to oust Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, saying the Minerals Council was not in the business of politics.
But he believes the Government will be convinced to back away from the tax, as it did from the Emissions Trading Scheme.
 We took on the Government's emissions trading scheme, not because we didn't want a carbon price in a carbon constrained world, not because we didn't want an emissions trading scheme, but because it was a dog of an emissions trading scheme,  he said.
 We fought that and we won that and we won that argument, and we're one of the very few organisations and industries that stood up and we didn't need to change the government to win that argument either.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"Queensland's coal-seam gas plans are hitting complications
ENERGY
 SANTOS'S decision this week to delay a final decision on its proposed $15 billion liquid natural gas project in central Queensland means it is likely to surrender first-mover status to British Gas in the race to export LNG from Queensland.
The Rudd government's proposed super profits tax has changed calculations on the long-term viability of the four LNG projects proposed for central Queensland, but signs are emerging that the tight timetables of the four proponents to export LNG by 2014 will be difficult to meet.
Western Australia's LNG industry is well established, but this year was supposed to be vital for LNG in Queensland.
Santos, BG Group and Origin Energy all planned before this week to make final investment decisions this year, while Shell and Arrow Energy planned to advance their takeover arrangement and make a final investment decision next year.
After this week, all the financials have changed, and worse for the companies concerned, there's no certainty about what they will be. True to form in the mining industry, the new tax already has an acronym -- the RSPT (resource super profits tax).
Taxing profits -- or for that matter super profits -- sounds great, but there is no detail on the point of production where the new tax will be levied.
In the case of tapping coal-seam gas from western Queensland to be piped to Gladstone for freezing into LNG, would the the tax be applied when the CSG comes out of the ground, or after it has been through a refining and freezing process -- in which case its value would be much greater?
Santos has been the most definite, saying it would make a decision sometime this year, instead of in mid-year.
Origin chief Grant King chose his words carefully at a Macquarie seminar in Sydney on Wednesday. Origin was due to make a final investment decision before the end of the year, but King said ``the RSPT has introduced significant additional cost to APLNG and uncertainty attached to this tax could affect the project schedule''.
BG Group and Shell-Arrow have indicated they are studying the fine print of the proposal, but it obviously complicates their investment decisions.
Aside from the federal government, there are complaints from the industry about the response times of the state government.
Santos and BG Group are the most advanced in obtaining environmental approvals from the state government, while the public comment period on Origin's environmental impact statement closed this week.
Part of the issue with the state government is the way approval has been split between departments. Last year, Premier Anna Bligh removed responsibility for LNG industry development from the Department of Planning and Infrastructure and gave it to Treasury.
Yet most of the environmental and industry approvals the four projects need come through co-ordinator general Colin Jensen, of the Department of Planning and Infrastructure. One industry source has complained there are no clear lines of accountability in the state government. As the projects have become bigger, other departments such as the Department of Mines and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have become involved.
The state government is the main body the industry must liaise with for work on the ground.
Four LNG refineries are planned for Curtis Island, near Gladstone, and there is some debate about the size of the construction camp there to accommodate the workforce.
The state government only wants 1100 people in the camp, while the companies and unions want 1800. The local council at Gladstone has approved another work camp at Calliope, so this is not an urgent issue, but it is dragging on.
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said the state government had some problems with the ``design'' of the super tax, and it was meeting the deadlines asked of it by the industry.
It's easy to see why the government wants such an industry.
It is not controversial among voters -- despite the opposition of the Greens -- and it could create jobs and help to restore Queensland's triple-A credit rating.
According to government estimates, the industry can create 18,000 jobs, investment of $40 billion, an increase of $3bn in gross state product, and generate $850 million in royalties each year.
All this, plus a better environmental outcome, as gas-fired power stations are considerably more greenhouse-friendly than coal-fired ones.
But aside from government actions, there is also considerable doubt in both government and the industry that all four projects will go ahead. The reason is simple: an LNG plant costs about $15bn, and building four such plants right beside each other to do exactly the same thing seems excessive when they could be rationalised.
Santos has the longest history with LNG. Arrow Energy and Queensland Gas pioneered mining the gas from the state's coal seams, but Adelaide-based Santos was the first to take the next step and examine freezing the gas into liquid.
The big advantage of a liquid over a gas is that liquid can be exported, while gas can only be transported through a pipeline.
In 2006, Santos negotiated with the Gladstone Port Corporation to buy freehold land on Curtis Island, on the other side of the harbour from Gladstone's main port, which is used as a coal-loading facility.
The island currently has no development and has traditionally been used for grazing, but after Santos purchased its land, the state government reserved a large area for the LNG refineries.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"An economic development agency for far north Queensland says a lack of a direct shipping to Papua New Guinea is proving to be a big trade barrier.
Advance Cairns chief executive, Ross Contarino, says Cairns suppliers are well placed to meet the demands of PNG's multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas projects which are expected to come on stream by 2014.
 He says most of the shipping now goes through Townsville or Brisbane, delaying consignments by at least a week.
 There are no direct services, so we are now looking at what sort of capacity there is in this region to export,  he said.
 So one of the things we are doing is asking local business if they are interested in having a direct service and they have produce that they like to have shipped from here to register that interest then we can talk to some of the shipping companies. 
However, he says businesses and primary producers in the far north need better export services.
 We see a real benefit for our region in providing a direct shipping link to Papua New Guinea - obviously we are one of the very closest major ports to that vicinity, fresh produce out of the Tablelands, dairy products, a lot of the goods that mining industry need and spare parts, tools and whatnot - we think a lot of that should be very easily be sent from this region,  he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"QUEENSLAND'S environmental watchdog has given a gas company the right to drill for and sell coal seam gas without an environmental impact statement being prepared.
The Environment Department gave Queensland Gas Corp an environmental authority for its Kenya gas field, near Tara on the Darling Downs, in 1997 and agreed to an amendment last year.
 Veteran environmental campaigner Drew Hutton said it was outrageous that a government department would approve such a potentially damaging operation without an EIS in place.
Conservationists and farmers have raised serious concerns about the emerging coal seam gas industry and its potential to damage aquifers and bring vast amounts of highly polluted water to the surface in some of the state's best farm land.
Environment Department director-general John Bradley said none of the criteria which would normally trigger an EIS applied in the QGC case.
The development did not involve construction of a new pipeline, a refining or processing facility and did not impact significantly on environmentally sensitive areas.
``But just because an EIS isn't required doesn't mean a rigorous environmental assessment did not take place,'' Mr Bradley said.
``In this instance, QGC was required to submit a detailed environmental management plan along with its amendment application, in a process which is very similar to an EIS.''
Issues QGC was required to address included impacts on land, soils, flora, fauna, water, air, noise and waste disposal.
Mr Hutton said it was no wonder farmers were upset about the project.
``I've been told by the Minister (Kate Jones) and the DG (John Bradley) that if mining companies are not able to solve problems with water aquifers, they will not get their environmental authority to go ahead with their various applications,'' he said.
``Then I find out that Queensland Gas has already been given an environmental authority to operate.''
Mr Hutton said he accepted approval for QGC, owned by British Gas, was not illegal but believed it was morally wrong.
``These coal seam gas companies have been treating farmers on the western Darling Downs with little or no respect,'' Mr Hutton said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,2,"WORLD sharemarkets are convulsing - again. This time, fears over bad bank debts have been replaced with fears about ballooning sovereign debt in Greece and a handful of other sunny but fragile European economies. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones tumbled nearly 1000 points last week, its biggest intraday fall on record. The Australian sharemarket is off nearly 10 per cent over the past week.
But this fresh panic on world markets is at odds with the Reserve Bank and Treasury's increasingly rosy outlook for the Australian economy. While other nations face bankruptcy, we are riding high on a resurgent commodities boom that could last for decades, according to the Treasury. When Gondwanaland split all those years ago, this  lucky country  managed to drift off with all the good stuff - vast reserves of coal, iron ore, uranium, natural gas and gold. We also managed to float not too far from China, the centre of growth in this, the Asian century.
 In its quarterly statement on monetary policy released on Friday, the Reserve Bank revised upward its expectations for growth, from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent next year. Inflation is also on the march, expected to bottom out stubbornly in the top half of the Reserve's 2 to 3 per cent band, at 2.75 per cent. A strengthening world economy is central to these Reserve forecasts. Continued strife on financial markets could spark a new reluctance by banks to lend which, if prolonged, could stifle recovery in the major economies. In the meantime, the Reserve expects commodity prices will continue to scale new heights and Australia's terms of trade - the price of our exports relative to our imports - will regain and exceed the peak in 2008.
The boom is back. But booms have never ended well for Australia. This time, a two-speed economy beckons, as a high exchange rate damages the competitiveness of our export industries such as manufacturing and tourism. Higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case will hurt homeowners. Weak retail sales released last week are just one sign of Australia's growth dilemma. Tomorrow, the Rudd government will hand down its third budget. Its first budget was plagued by inflation, its second by fears of recession. The focus of this third must be managing the new boom. Already it has decided to shave of some of the top of the boom with a resource rent tax on miners. If this has the effect of sluicing off some of the froth of the boom, that may be no bad thing.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE Queensland economy took a hit of nearly $300 million yesterday as Xstrata cancelled its exploration program around Mt Isa and a takeover offer for Macarthur Coal was slashed because of Canberra's resource super-profits tax.
The move follows the decision by Santos last week to delay its $15 billion liquefied natural gas project in central Queensland because of uncertainty about the impact of the tax.
 More bad news could be on the horizon with BG Group chief executive Cath Tanna's departure yesterday for London for talks with BG's British parent about its looming decision on LNG investment in the state. However, company sources stressed that matters other than the new tax were to be discussed.
Xstrata's decision stops $30m worth of exploration in the Mt Isa and Cloncurry districts over the next three years, while the almost unprecedented reduced offer from $16 to $15 a share by the US-based Peabody Energy for Macarthur, wiped $254m off the value of the miner.
The Queensland Resources Council was last night meeting with Premier Anna Bligh over the effects of the tax. Council chief executive Michael Roche argued that the events of yesterday showed miners need certainty in the short-term.
``The government talks about 12 months consultation being a good thing -- well it's not,'' he said.
``The super-profits tax is not good news for the best part of $100bn worth of resource projects that are on the books here in Queensland.
``We have a period of uncertainty ahead which needs to be resolved as quickly as possible.''
Mr Roche said the industry wanted urgent clarification of whether the tax would be retrospective and if it would be applied equally to all forms of mining.
Chief operating officer for Xstrata Copper North Queensland, Steve de Kruijff, said the exploration would remain suspended until there was greater certainty.
``Exploration activities are high risk and, while the targets we had identified are prospective, the proposed tax has introduced great uncertainty about the potential impact on the economics of developing resources into viable operations in Australia,'' he said.
``It would also change the relative economics of these prospects compared with exploration programs that Xstrata Copper is pursuing in other parts of the world.
``Exploration is the lifeblood of the mining industry but it is not possible to justify Xstrata Copper's on-going funding of additional exploration activities when the fundamental economics of the industry in Australia are being challenged.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"To keep the lights on, government must tell energy providers what is wanted
AUSTRALIA has the great advantage of one of the most reliable, secure and cost competitive electricity and domestic natural gas systems in the world.
 Our electricity system is built around a very significant natural advantage: the massive availability of very low cost and easily accessed coal.
The Australian economy is the winner with our electricity prices consistently rated among the lowest in the developed world. Large-scale energy-intensive industry has grown in Australia as a result, employing thousands of people and paying millions in tax.
Australians pay low prices by world standards for a first-rate electricity system. But the climate change challenge is here.
This is a serious issue for Australia's electricity and gas sector, as its emissions account for almost 50 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions.
Far from resisting the need to address the emissions issue, the energy supply industry has openly embraced the need for change.
In the past six years, the electricity and domestic natural gas industries have called for stable, predictable and commercially sensible greenhouse gas abatement policies that efficiently move the economy, and therefore the energy supply system, to a different, lower-emission outcome.
Why a heavily fossil-fuel-based industry is calling for such measures is easily answered.
There are few, if any, more capital-intensive and consumptive industries in the world than the energy sector. The assets that deliver energy to our economy cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, last for up to 50 years and take at least 20 years to pay back their initial outlays.
With a fast-growing economy and population growth strongly exceeding the OECD average, the energy-supply industry is constantly required to invest in new assets to meet increasing demand.
But with a greenhouse issue apparent and politicians signalling their intent to respond, efficient and secure energy asset investment can only occur if this issue is positively and directly addressed by the national government.
There is also a second and generally unknown reason why the electricity and gas industries are ready to embrace change. Put simply, low carbon energy supply, especially via electricity, holds many of the answers to how the world reduces its emissions without reducing the lifestyles of citizens in developed countries, while massively improving the welfare of millions of people in the least developed nations.
Transportation will increasingly rely on electricity. Space heating and cooling requirements will most efficiently be met by innovative electrical technologies.
In a bigger Australia our drinking water supply will need supplementation from desalination plants; a new electricity consumer.
The fuels for creating this lower-emission electricity will be renewable, natural gas, and in the longer term coal with carbon capture and storage.
It is clearly in the medium to long-term interest of the energy supply industry to move to lowering its emissions. But to do this, there must be appropriate government policy in place.
The government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme had the potential to meet this requirement but failed to deliver a sensible transition path for Australia's electricity industry.
Put simply, its effect was to harshly penalise the very companies that have delivered energy advantage to Australians for decades and who have the expertise, networks and business models to deliver the next generation of energy systems.
It sent shudders through the global debt and equity providers on which the sector relies for finance. They now view Australia as a risky location for electricity investment. The CPRS as a result is unacceptable to the electricity industry. The next policy has to redress these failings.
The government's announcement that the CPRS is on ice until the end of 2012 is potentially good news, but only if Australia's main political parties take the opportunity provided by the delay to work with industry to agree and legislate a stable and enduring greenhouse policy.
There is much at stake. Generation capacity at June 2009 was almost 51,000 megawatts by 2020 we will need about 65,000MW.
Previous analysis by the industry shows more than $100 billion in new investment will be needed by then to meet load growth, the 20 per cent renewable energy target, network development and a 5 per cent emission reduction target. And this is to come from an industry that today employs assets worth $120bn.
It is a mammoth task.
Without an enduring carbon policy to guide investment decisions, energy businesses will defer new generation investment decisions for as long as possible, inevitably allowing the supply-demand balance to reach very tight outcomes, with resulting high prices and narrow margins for error when demand is high, such as on hot days.
And new generating plants do not magically appear overnight. Large power plants take between five and seven years to plan and construct if everything runs on schedule.
Some commentators interpret this tightening of supply as a sign Australia will run out of electricity if a carbon policy is not settled. However, almost certainly the lights will stay on, as new just-in-time, mainly gas-fired generating plant is built and with the help of inter-connectors that allow electricity to flow between the states.
But without a stable and sensible greenhouse policy this electricity will almost certainly be more expensive than it should be.
We have recently witnessed first-hand what happens when policy is poorly designed and deployed. The capital strike in the large-scale renewable generation sector graphically demonstrated that when policy is uncertain, investors stay away. As Australia's electricity demand-supply balance tightens, it is imperative we have a stable and well-designed regime in place by 2012-13 at the latest to allow good investment decisions to be made.
Time is of the essence: the Prime Minister's decision has brought into sharp focus the urgent need for Australia to secure bipartisan agreement on greenhouse policy and offers both sides of politics a rare opportunity.
Grasped, this opportunity will allow our government and the alternative government to put the interests of Australia and the interests of ensuring a reliable and least-cost energy supply first.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ENERGY: Coal seam gas explorer Bow Energy has ratcheted up its gas export ambitions, targeting enough proven, probable and possible, or 3P, gas reserves to supply a Queensland liquefied natural gas train by 2011.
The company plans to shore up its 3P reserves to 6200 petajoules by the end of 2011.
 ``If proven that the gas can be economically recovered, (this) represents sufficient reserves to supply the 240 petajoules per annum approximately needed for a 4 million tonne per annum LNG train over a 25-year period,'' Bow said yesterday.
To prove that it can be economically recovered would require substantially more shoring up to move the 6000PJ of 3P reserves into the proven and probable, or 2P category.
Chief executive John De Stefani said Bow was in talks with majors planning LNG plants on Curtis Island off Gladstone and with Perth's LNG Ltd, which was seeking supply for its smaller Fisherman's Landing plant on the mainland at Gladstone.
``Fisherman's Landing is definitely of interest; their site is of advantage compared with Curtis Island,'' Mr De Stefani said. ``But we are interested to see how they go finding a strategic partner (to buy the LNG).''
Earlier this week, LNG Ltd signed a 30-year lease for the site at Gladstone. It also said it was in discussions with potential strategic partners to buy LNG and supply gas to the project.

  This will then complete all the approvals to recommence construction of the onshore LNG plant, subject to finalisation of gas supply arrangements,  LNG Ltd said in a statement.
The project was put on hold in early March when Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina made a multi-billion dollar takeover offer for LNG Ltd's joint venture partner, coal seam gas producer Arrow Energy Ltd.
Arrow previously had agreed to buy-out LNG Ltd's stake and provide gas to feed the project, but late last month it agreed to the Shell/PetroChina takeover.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"THE East Timorese government has complained to the ASX about Woodside's announcement that it plans to build a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the multibillion-dollar Greater Sunrise field in the Timor Sea.
A briefing prepared for East Timor's parliament says that in a letter to the ASX, the government has accused Woodside of not providing the public and press with accurate information about the status of the project.
 The letter says statements by Woodside have  the potential to mislead the market as to the true position with regard to the development of the Greater Sunrise project .
It says the statements  may have an impact upon the way in which Woodside is perceived by the market and thus [have] an impact upon its share price .
The letter reiterates demands by East Timor's leaders that the Woodside-led consortium build a pipeline to a processing plant on their country's south coast.
Amid growing acrimony over the project, the leaders have said repeatedly they would not approve either a floating platform or piping the gas to an existing plant in Darwin, which the consortium also considered.
The letter says the government's stand had been made  patently apparent to Woodside . It also says it is clear from a number of recent press releases, and other releases of information, that  Woodside has ignored the government's position .
In the letter, East Timor asks the ASX to instruct Woodside to correct statements the company made about Greater Sunrise in its 2009 annual report, market statements and statements made at the company's annual general meeting on April 30.
Those statements  clearly give the public and investors the impression that a decision on the development of the Greater Sunrise field is imminent and that it is Woodside and its joint-venture partners that have the final say as to how the development should proceed .
The letter says Woodside's statements had failed to acknowledge that the  Greater Sunrise fields cannot be developed  without East Timor's consent.
The letter asks Woodside to inform the ASX and the public within seven days  as to the true position with regard to the development of the Greater Sunrise field .
It says this includes that negotiations on development of the field are ongoing with relevant authorities in East Timor, and that  no decisions will be made regarding the development of the field until such a time as all necessary mechanisms for negotiation and discussion of issues relating to the project have been concluded .
East Timor asks for confirmation that Woodside would make no further releases that fail to acknowledge that East Timor has indicated it will not agree to any development of the field unless a pipeline is built from the field to East Timor.
Woodside chief executive officer Don Voelte told journalists last week â€” after East Timor's Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmao, refused to meet him in Dili â€” that East Timor could not walk away from the Greater Sunrise agreement it signed only 2 years ago.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"SANTOS'S Queensland liquefied natural gas project is almost certain to be pushed back by at least a year, analysts say, as delays in locking in a buyer for the gas and uncertainty over the resource tax cloud the $8 billion development.
Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Jason Mabee said he expected the cost of the one-train Gladstone LNG development to eclipse the $7.7 billion price tag provided two years ago.
 In lowering his price target for Santos from $17 a share to $15, Mr Mabee concludes that the best outcome for the Santos/Petronas development may be to invite Shell and PetroChina, which are building their own LNG facility in Gladstone, to become part of the joint venture.
Commentators expect the fledgling coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas sector in Queensland to be one of the hardest hit by the federal government's plans to apply a 40 per cent tax to profits above 6 per cent from 2012, because it is a start-up.
Origin Energy managing director Grant King said last week that plans to build a $35 billion LNG plant in Gladstone could be threatened by the tax.
At its annual meeting in Adelaide last week, Santos managing director David Knox poured scorn on the 40 per cent tax, saying it could push out a final investment decision, expected by midyear, and would  paralyse investment .
 Progress on GLNG has been substantial and we remain on target for first LNG deliveries in 2014. We will make a final investment decision this year,  he said.  We are in detailed and advanced discussions with a number of LNG buyers for train one and train two offtake, and for equity in the project. I am confident of being able to make an announcement on this shortly. 
RBS said the tax talk might have caused investors to hit the pause button and questioned whether 2014 was still a reality.
 We believe the resource super-profits tax may have spooked any prospective LNG buyers,  RBS said.  We think the uncertainty created by the proposed RSPT will only aid to further push out the timeline (we now expect 2015 commissioning), although it seems management remains publicly confident of signing an offtake agreement in the near term. 
Mr Mabee told clients that a tie-up between Santos/Petronas and Shell/PetroChina, assuming the Arrow Energy takeover was successful, would be viewed positively by the market.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,2,"Surat Basin landholders and community members affected by the coal seam gas industry are making a stand and speaking with one voice under the newly formed Basin Sustainability Alliance.
The alliance has received wide representation from across the Surat Basin region and has been formed to support individuals, landholder groups and communities involved with the CSG industry.
 Basin Sustainability Alliance chairman Ian Hayllor said the group was calling for a moratorium on further coal seam gas development.
â€œThis is until the full environmental impacts on communities, groundwater systems and agricultural land are understood and addressed,â€? he said.
â€œDuring the gas extraction process, it has been forecast that 40,000 wells will extract up to 350,000 megalitres of water from the Great Artesian Basin annually.
â€œTaking this magnitude of water away from this groundwater system each year will have a significant impact on the sustainability of the whole basin.
The gas extraction process is another issue the alliance is concerned about.
â€œWaste products including two million tonnes of salt, will be produced annually as part of the gas extraction process,â€? Mr Hayllor said.
â€œThis increase in salt load far exceeds natural resource management targets for salt load in the Murray Darling Basin approved by the State and Commonwealth governments.
â€œWhen multiplied over the 20 to 30 years life span of the industry, these figures clearly show that in its current form the coal seam gas industry is unsustainable.â€?
In the meantime, the alliance will also focus on raising funds and appointing a chief executive officer, administration officer and undergoing a major research and information gathering campaign.
Mr Hayllor said it was then looking to education communities as well as the State Government on how to better manage the State's future.
â€œWe can't stop the industry but we have a responsibility to bring a hault to the industry and raise the issues to the public.
â€œAlso to put pressure on the government to focus on sustainability for the future.â€?

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"South Korea recently resumed exploratory drilling in waters off its east coast to find out whether a long-hidden energy resource could be turned into a new wellspring of natural gas to meet growing demand and cut reliance on imported supplies.
Other major energy users and importers, including the United States, China, Japan and India, have similar research and development programs to unlock what they hope will be a treasure trove of methane hydrates on land and sea. All aim to be in commercial production by 2020 at the latest.
 While Australia, too, may have extensive gas hydrate reserves, the development of commercial hydrate production in countries like South Korea, Japan and China that are leading buyers of liquefied natural gas from Australia could result in a potentially large LNG sales loss as those users become more self-sufficient.
Energy specialists estimate the global gas hydrate resource may amount to between 1000 billion and 10,000 billion tonnes â€“ or as much as twice the known reserves of conventional fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas). However, there are challenges as the race accelerates to recover frozen methane on a large scale. It has so far proved difficult to extract the methane from the hydrates in a continuous and cost-effective way.
In addition, some scientists are concerned that exploiting the resource could intensify climate change. Methane from energy production, wetland rice farming, sheep and cattle grazing, urban landfills and other sources already accounts for about 17 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, second only to carbon dioxide.
The Asia-Pacific region is reported to be the main regional source of methane. When released into the atmosphere unburned, methane is at least 25 times more potent as a global warming gas than carbon dioxide, although it only persists for a decade or so, instead of lasting for over a century as much of the CO2 does.
South Korea has hired a deep-water drilling ship to sink 32 holes in the next few weeks at a cost of $US37 million ($41.2 million) in a sea basin south of the Dokdo Islands, which are disputed with Japan. South Korean officials say that initial estimates indicate there is enough recoverable methane in the deposit to meet its demands for up to 30 years.
Methane hydrate promises to be a relatively clean fossil fuel source. But as commercial development proceeds, governments and the energy industry will need to put in safeguards to ensure that it does not intensify global warming and cause dangerous climate change.

Perth-based LNG Ltd said that a fixed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) price for the first LNG processing `train', an LNG tank with capacity for 5.25 million tonnes per annum of production, and associated site infrastructure totaled $US720 million ($A803.89 million).
 The capital cost of the second and third trains is $US300 million ($A334.95 million) each.
The capital cost for the marine works including ship loading structures, dredging and reclamation is $US85 million ($A94.9 million).
LNG Ltd managing director Maurice Brand said the overall capital cost was higher than the company estimated in 2008/9, due to an increased project scope and LNG plant size, combined with the substantial appreciation in the Australian dollar.
 However, the company and its proposed EPC contractors have identified various areas where capital cost savings can potentially be achieved as part of the current final design and value engineering phases,  Mr Brand said in a statement on Friday.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE Queensland government and the state's high-profile Resources Council have declared they will support a form of the federal government's proposed resources super-profits tax, but with significant amendments.
The state governments of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia all have significant problems with the proposed tax, but it is especially important for Queensland where several companies are making final investment decisions about the liquefied natural gas industry.
 Premier Anna Bligh told the Queensland Resources Council she would use ``forceful diplomacy'' to get amendments to the tax, while the QRC has written to all ALP members offering to brief them further on objections to it.
The letter says: ``QRC members -- representing almost 80 minerals and energy companies in Queensland -- agree with the principle of a profits-based resource tax, administered by the federal government but without financial penalty to the states currently operating output-based royalty regimes.''
QRC chief executive Michael Roche said there were several points on which the industry wanted quick clarification and several amendments that he said would not change the spirit of the tax but make it fairer.
He said that his members did not want it levied retrospectively, wanted different rates for different resources instead of a flat 40 per cent on all minerals, wanted it to kick in at a higher level, and wanted it to be levied on the primary resource only.
``What we don't want to see is a situation which effectively taxes value-adding, so that refining or processing is taxed more than it is now,'' Mr Roche said.
Ms Bligh said yesterday she believed mining companies should pay their fair share of tax, but this in-principle support for the RSPT did not exclude changes to its design.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"THE new resources tax raises the risks facing five coal and iron ore projects, including Clive Palmer's China First in Queensland, analysts say.
But some coal seam gas companies may be using it as a convenient excuse for delays.
 The mining sector has come out swinging over the planned 40 per cent tax on resource company super profits, with industry representative group the Queensland Resources Council saying the Rudd Government is rolling the dice on more than $100 billion worth of Queensland projects.
Citigroup analysts said that of large mining projects currently under consideration in Australia, $23 billion in projects in the coal and iron ore sectors ``potentially face increased risk of not proceeding''.
Citigroup made no change to its 2010 and 2011 sector investment forecasts.
But it said the medium-term investment pipeline might become more uncertain as return rates on projects under consideration were revisited once the tax scheme's design was finalised after industry consultation now under way.
The analysts identified five planned projects which potentially were under threat.
They are Clive Palmer's China First thermal coal project in Queensland and four Western Australia iron ore projects - the Jack Hills mine (owned by Crossland Resources), the Solomon mine (Fortescue Metals), Solomon's related plant and port facilities, and the Roy Hill mine (Hancock Prospecting).
These projects represent investment of $23 billion or 13 per cent of total large potential mining projects in Australia.
Citigroup noted there had been a wide range of company comments that the new tax would delay project approvals or derail them completely.
It said Santos and Origin Energy both had flagged delays to their targeted final investment decisions for their coal seam gas and liquefied natural gas projects, attributing this in part to the new tax.
Continued P43
Risky business
Projects with increased risk:
* China First thermal coal mine in Queensland
* Crossland Resources' Jack Hills iron ore mine in WA
* Fortescue's Solomon iron ore mine and related port, plant facilities in WA
* Hancock Prospecting's Roy Hill iron ore project in WA
Big mine projects put at risk
From P40
``We wonder whether in these cases the (tax) is a convenient excuse, however, given delays in signing up customers and delays in achieving environmental approvals,'' the Citi analysts said in a note to investors.
``Rio Tinto has said that it is reviewing the potential effect of the (tax) but has not yet decided to shelve any projects.''
Analysts at RBS Morgans said the new tax would add to already widespread market views that consolidation was likely among the coal seam gas-LNG projects in Queensland.
RBS said the new tax might prompt Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, BG Group and Santos to merge gas projects targeting fuel shipments to China, Japan and South Korea.
``It certainly increases the likelihood of consolidation, given that it reduces the rate of return for all of these projects,'' RBS analyst Nik Burns told the Bloomberg newswire yesterday.
The most likely scenario was that Santos combined its LNG project with the venture proposed by Shell and PetroChina, while Origin and ConocoPhillips might merge their development with BG's venture.
He said ideally, all of these projects would come together in a single mega-project as it would lead to the most cost savings and labour savings.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Japan's Inpex has flagged a delay in sanctioning its $24 billion Ichthys liquefied natural gas project in north-west Australia.
Inpex, which is about 30 per cent owned by the Japanese government, and France's Total would not make a final decision this year on Ichthys as planned and would miss their 2015 target to start LNG deliveries from a proposed plant in Darwin, director Masahiro Murayama told reporters in Tokyo.
 The schedule for the plant has been deferred several times, partly because of the technical challenges of an 885-kilometre pipeline to transport gas to the plant from the offshore fields in the Browse Basin.
The Ichthys project and the four most-advanced coal seam gas-based LNG projects in Queensland repÂ­resent more than $90 billion of investment and form a core part of a surge in LNG supply that could have Australia rival Qatar as the world's biggest supplier of the fuel by the end of the decade.
Engineering and labour constraints, construction costs and uncertain energy demand forecasts in Australia's key LNG markets in Asia are all hurdles yet to be overcome by the queue of ventures ambitiously planned for sanction.
The Ichthys venture, which is to produce 8.4 million tonnes a year of LNG, has yet to nail down customers for its gas after widening its target market beyond Japan to the rest of Asia. The latest delay will be detailed today at an investor briefing in Â­Tokyo and means it risks slipping behind Chevron's rival Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, which is heading for approval next year and has clinched sales accords with two buyers in Japan.
Chevron and its partners in Wheatstone appear to be going flat out to keep to their schedule. There was news this week of progress on early engineering work on two offshore fields that will supply gas to the 8.6 million tonnes a year plant.
Apache and its partner, Kuwait's Kufpec, are poised to announce the award of the contract for engineering design work on the Julimar and Brunello gas fields on the North West Shelf to JP Kenny, part of London-listed Wood Group.
Apache has estimated investment of $US1.8 billion ($2 billion) will be required for the development of the offshore fields, including sub-sea engineering and a link to an offshore processing platform at Chevron's Wheatstone field. Gas production was due to start in 2015, Apache's president of international business, Rod Eichler, said last week.
The onshore part of the project, involving a liquefaction plant at Ashburton North near Onslow, is expected to cost another $US18 billion, Apache estimates.
The US company has a 16.25 per cent stake in the onshore plant as part of a gas supply deal sealed with Chevron last October when it turned its back on an alternative link-up with Woodside's Pluto LNG expansion project.
Frank Harris, head of LNG at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said it was in the interest of Australian LNG ventures to forge ahead and commit to building their plants as soon as possible because of the threat of rival supply sources emerging later this decade.
 There is a strong incentive for projects in Australia to get customers signed up and get to a final investment decision,  he said.
 The price levels out there at the moment are pretty robust but as you go forward the level of uncertainty increases. 
KEY POINTS Inpex has delayed the go-ahead for a $24 billion gas project in Darwin. Pressure is building on LNG projects to proceed or risk losing customers to rival suppliers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Development of Queensland's fledgling natural gas export industry risks stalling while the implications of the proposed resources super profits tax are worked through, according to industry analysts.
While fears of wide-scale project cancellations may be overdone, none of the liquefied natural gas ventures will commit the tens of billions of dollars required to build their plants under the prevailing cloud of fiscal uncertainty, observers say.
 Two project proponents, Origin Energy and Santos, have already warned that final investment decisions on their respective ventures, due this year, could be deferred. Royal Dutch Shell says it's studying the proposed tax and how it would impact its Australian business but won't respond to speculation it may cut the offer price of its $3.45 billion bid with PetroChina for coal seam gas producer Arrow Energy. PetroChina declined to comment. Coal seam gas-based projects stand to suffer the most of Australia's $200 billion line-up of proposed LNG plants, which are already struggling with uncertain demand in key Asian markets, and labour and engineering shortages. Under existing regulations, the projects face a royalty fee of about 10 per cent, which would be replaced by the planned 40 per cent tax on profits generated above the long-term bond rate.
The tax may erode returns enough to finally force the overcrowded Queensland LNG industry towards some overdue consolidation, says Nik Burns at RBS Morgans in Melbourne. He sees potential for Shell and PetroChina to link up with the GLNG venture at Gladstone between Santos and Malaysia's Petronas, and for closer co-operation between BG's project and the Australia Pacific LNG venture between Origin and US partner ConocoPhillips.
Analysts' estimates of the hit the Queensland projects would take from proposed tax vary, depending on the point in the production cycle they assume it is levied â€“ a key factor yet to be clarified. Applying the tax at the point where the gas was extracted would be less of a blow to project economics than a levy on the gas ready to be shipped as LNG.
Credit Suisse's Andrew Williams, who assumes the tax will apply where the gas is extracted, estimates it would shave 1-1.2 percentage points off the internal rate of return of a coal seam gas-LNG project, which shouldn't be enough to abandon it.  If 100 basis points tips you into a 'no' decision then your project was pretty marginal anyway,  he said, adding that customers, capital costs and gas reserves will remain the three most crucial elements.
But if the tax were levied on the export LNG price it could knock 3-4 percentage points off rates of return, pushing them down perilously close to the  borderline  10 per cent level, said a more bearish analyst, who is using a  worst-case  scenario for his calculations.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"LNG
GAS producer Santos has shown faith in the future of its Queensland coal-seam gas proposal by awarding a $50 million contract to build gas wells and pipelines in the western Darling Downs.
 Before Canberra's proposed resource super-profits tax was announced, Santos had envisaged making a final investment decision on its $15 billion project involving a liquid natural gas plant at Gladstone by the middle of the year.
But last week, Santos chief executive David Knox said the company was now more likely to make a decision before the end of the year, largely because of uncertainty regarding the tax.
Santos's announcement yesterday stressed that a more detailed contract would be let when a final investment decision was made. But in the meantime, Fluor Australia would carry out engineering, procurement and construction of the ``upstream facilities component'' of the Gladstone LNG project.
``In the interim, Santos will extend Fluor's engineering design contract to include early works activities of approximately $50m,'' the company said.
This ``upstream facilities component'' comprises coal-seam gas and associated infrastructure in the company's gas fields, which are predominantly in the Surat basin on the western Darling Downs, near Chinchilla, but also further north in the Bowen Basin.
Currently, there are four projects vying to be the first to produce LNG for export in 2014, with Santos ahead of the other three projects in terms of getting its approvals from government in place.
But Santos is still reliant on its partner, Malaysian-based Petronas, to deliver it customers, and the company is looking for another company to take up 9 per cent equity and become another customer.
By contrast, the British-based BG Group already has customers for nearly 10 million tonnes of LNG.
But a particular frustration for all the four projects is that they are still not fully aware of how the RSPT will apply to them, and under Canberra's timetable for its consultative process with industry will not be able to get a more detailed briefing until the end of this month.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,2,"I suzu is in its 21st year as No1 truck-seller in Australia. So when the Japanese giant makes any move in the market it's worth paying close attention to. Consequently there's a lot of interest in the company's decision to import compressed natural gas, or CNG, trucks to Australia particularly among managers of large fleets, because cost savings can be significant. Isuzu has been selling CNG trucks in Japan for 20 years, so is no beginner when it comes to this technology. Isuzu Australia Limited imported some CNG trucks on a trial in 2004, but without real success. The new versions use multi-point fuel injection instead of a carburettor and are better, so Isuzu expects real interest this time around. Natural gas is also used in homes to cook and heat, and reaches residences by underground pipes. But before it can be used as transport fuel it has to be compressed, at
 pressures of up to 200 bar, to carry enough fuel to provide a workable range. In the Isuzu trucks the gas is carried in tanks between the chassis rails, so little space is lost. However, the pressure vessels need to be strong, adding about 160kg to the N Series models and 280kg to the F Series. CNG engines run more cleanly than diesel units, and already meet some aspects of the strict Euro 6 emissions requirements. A date is yet to be set for the Australian introduction of this European emission regulation. The Transport Industry Council feels some government assistance is necessary before the fuel can be a success in Australia. This assistance is already provided by governments in most countries in which CNG is being promoted by Isuzu. At this stage public refuelling of CNG is severely limited, with only seven stations in Australia. More are expected, but government help is required. However, quite a few fleet operators already have CNG on site, to be used to fuel forklift trucks and possibly for heating as well. Isuzu has developed new engines for its CNG models.
These spark ignition units have a capacity of 4.7lt in the NLR 200 and NPR 300. Peak torque of 363Nm is developed at only 1400rpm, with maximum power of 96kW at 3600 revs. These vehicles have a GVM of 4.5 tonnes and 7.0 tonnes respectively. They run slightly lower gearing than the equivalent diesel models to compensate for the different torque characteristics. A typical fuel range in the N Series CNG will be about 300km. The big Isuzu F Series, being imported to Australia in CNG form in FSR (GVM 12 tonnes) and FSR 850 (14 tonnes), are powered by a six- cylinder engine displacing 7.8lt. This produces 735Nm of torque at 1400rpm, with maximum power of 162kW at 2400rpm. The fuel range is about 400km. On test drives of the N Series and F Series models it becomes apparent that the engines are far quieter than diesel powerplants. Throttle response is good and the strong torque at low engine speeds is appreciated. However, the torque drops off more quickly than in similar diesel engines so it's best to keep the engine in the lower segments of the tachometer. Pulling power is impressive and
engines are generally happy to hold on to higher gears on hills. During our test period we didn't need to refuel. But a training video showed that it doesn't look more complicated than refuelling a vehicle running on LPG. Isuzu says obtaining a full fuel load will typically require about six minutes, similar to diesel. The bad news is the price. Isuzu hasn't completed its final calculations, but the recommended retail price of the Isuzu NLR 200 is about $51,658 (35 per cent more than the diesel model), and the NPR 300 $65,531 (up 30 per cent). Isuzu points out that the increase in engine capacity from 3.0lt to 4.6lt in the NLR 200 and the increase in carrying capacity in the NPR 300 from 6.5t to 7.0t have to be taken into consideration when looking at this price premiums for the CNG models. The Isuzu FSR 700 and FSR 850 are both listed at $113,084. There will be major savings in fuel costs and company accountants will obviously have to do calculations based on their individual circumstances. These new Isuzu CNG trucks have a warranty of three years, or 100,000km or 2000 hours. This can be extended to six years or 300,000km at additional cost.

BRISBANE, May 16 AAP - The controversial resources super profits tax and the contribution of Australian natural gas to the Asia-Pacific's energy needs will be key topics at an international oil and gas conference in Brisbane this week.
 More than 2400 people from 25 countries will meet to discuss the growing sector at the 50th annual Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration (APPEA) conference from Monday.
APPEA chief executive Belinda Robinson said Australian projects on the drawing boards were already worth more than $220 billion and could create 55,000 jobs and $10 billion a year in government revenue.
She said the increasing demand for cleaner sources of energy positioned Australia well as a reliable supplier of natural gas and should be central to climate change policy thinking.
 Australia's abundant natural gas reserves, proximity to the growing economies of our Asia-Pacific neighbours and technological advancements in the industry make for an economic game change for Australia,  Ms Robinson said.
 ... If the LNG projects currently under consideration proceed, Australia could become a top three global exporter of LNG. 
But proposed changes to the resource sector's tax regime had had a  very destabilising impact  on the industry, she said.
 Certainty over the long-term design of Australia's taxation regime that incorporates an accurate and fair reflection of the magnitude of the risk and capital investment involved in this industry is absolutely critical to these projects moving forward in the timeframe anticipated,  Ms Robinson said.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"LNG BRISBANE, May 17 AAP - The Queensland government says new laws to go to state parliament this week will better protect landholders' rights when their land is accessed for coal seam gas exploration.
Mines Minister Stephen Robertson said laws would ensure investment in the industry can go ahead while protecting valuable farmland, groundwater supplies and the environment.
  The changes aim to bring more consistent processes and more clarity on the rights and obligations of all parties involved in private land access, encouraging early engagement to negotiate agreed terms,  Mr Robertson said in a statement.
Coal seam gas is methane gas trapped in coal seams under the pressure of water. By pumping the water out, the gas molecules are released, creating a relatively clean energy which will be used and exported as liquefied natural gas (LNG).
The Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland are proven prospects for CSG, with the potential to produce up to 40 million tonnes of LNG per year out of Gladstone.
Some farmers are upset at what they see as the bullying tactics of mining companies, and especially about the need to pump out vast amounts of water from underground aquifers on which the farmers rely.
Most of the CSG activities in Queensland are currently in the exploration phase.
Mr Robertson said every proposed project would be required to have state and federal environmental impact assessments and his department would keep tabs on water quality.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"SHELL PERTH, May 17 AAP - Worldwide demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will almost double to between 350 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and 400 mtpa by 2020 compared with about 200 mpta currently, global energy giant Royal Dutch Shell says.
Queensland's booming coal seam gas-to-LNG sector was entering a new phase of growth and investment and would play a major role in meeting rising demand for the fuel, Shell senior executive Anne Pickard said.
 Ms Pickard, who is executive vice-president of Shell Upstream International's Australian arm, said the energy giant remained hopeful that it would complete its proposed multi-billion-dollar joint takeover of Brisbane-based CSG producer Arrow Energy that was being undertaken with PetroChina Ltd.
She also said Australia represented the key plank in Shell's push to boost its LNG output.
 Globally, we aim to add around 15 million tonnes per year of LNG capacity by 2020, and much of that effort and investment will be focused in Australia, making us one of the biggest investors in the country,  Ms Pickard told the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association Ltd conference in Brisbane on Monday.
 If the (Arrow) transaction is completed, we will be in a position, through Arrow, to establish an integrated CSG-LNG operation.
 It will bring together Arrow's expertise as a leading coal seam gas operator, Shell's LNG know-how, and PetroChina's access to the Chinese energy market.
 We are excited about this project (Arrow's Curtis Island LNG project at Gladstone) and hope the joint acquisition is successful. 
The deal requires shareholder, legal and government approvals.
Ms Pickard said Shell, as a joint venture partner in the contentious Woodside Petroleum Ltd-operated Sunrise project in the Timor Sea, was  committed to working with all stakeholders, both in East Timor and Australia, to demonstrate the significant value and opportunities this development would bring .
Woodside has decided to use floating LNG processing vessels for Sunrise, despite the Timor government arguing a plant should be on Timor shores.
Shell is set to be the first company to employ floating LNG-processing technology at its Prelude project in Western Australia's Browse Basin.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"Tax plan threat to $3 billion revenue
ABOUT 18,000 new jobs and $3 billion in export revenue are at risk in Queensland's fledgling coal seam gas industry if the federal government's resource rent tax proceeds as proposed.
 Australia's oil and gas sector this week will intensify its fight against the government's 40 per cent profits-based tax as about 2400 industry representatives from 25 countries converge on Brisbane for the 50th annual Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration (APPEA) Conference.
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott will also address the conference, hoping to gain traction on the controversial policy and make the mining tax a key election issue against Labor.
APPEA chief executive Belinda Robinson said Australia had more than $220 billion worth of oil and gas projects on the drawing board, with the potential to create up to 55,000 jobs and an extra $10 billion annually in government revenue.
She said of those proposed projects, the coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas industry was perhaps the most vulnerable to the government's resource rent tax because it was still in its infancy.
 Here in Queensland the proposed CSG-LNG projects represent a brand new export industry for this state and for Australia,  she said.  This industry will see Australia become the world's first exporter of LNG from CSG.
 Certainty over the long-term design of Australia's taxation regime that incorporates an accurate and fair reflection of the magnitude of the risk and capital investment involved in this industry, is absolutely critical to these projects. 
Ms Robinson said she hoped the federal government noted the concerns expressed at the conference over the next few days, despite being outside of the formal consultation process, which has been criticised for being too narrow in terms of what can be debated.
 The impact, the necessity for, and the detail of the government's proposal for a resources super tax is certain to be front and centre of the APPEA conference both in the corridors and in the formal presentations,  she said.  There will not be a person at the conference who will not be affected by the government's recent announcement to introduce a new tax on the industry and I have no doubt that their views will be well articulated. 
Meanwhile, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto executives will fly to Canberra this week to voice their concerns to the government's consultation panel. BHP chief Marius Kloppers has already said the $22 billion expansion of Olympic Dam would be  very difficult  under the new tax, while Rio has committed to restarting its $US400 million ($A451 million) Canadian iron ore expansion as it puts all its Australian projects on hold while it assesses the impact on the tax on its bottom line.
Australia's union movement is debating the impact on jobs, launching its own TV ads calling on Australians to support the tax.
For his part, Mr Abbott is keen to highlight how he says the tax will affect ordinary Australians.
 This isn't just a tax on BHP, it is a tax on Macquarie which provides our building material, it is a tax on the phosphate mine which provides the fertiliser which produces our food,  he said.  The budget rests on the government's new mining tax and the election should turn on this, too.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Qatar, the world's largest liquefied natural gas producer, has raised the stakes in its bid to dominate global gas markets by declaring that half of Australia's $220 billion of planned gas export projects will not be built as planned in the next decade.
Australia is poised to become the world's second-largest gas exporter Â­after Qatar, with plans to increase production fourfold to 100 million tonnes a year by 2015.
 That would provide a major boost to the nation's economy and increase tax revenue by an estimated $125 billion over the next decade.
Yet the tiny Middle East state remains the undisputed market leader with a commitment to produce 77 million tonnes of LNG in 2010, four times as much as Australia.
State-run Qatargas, which controls the majority of the country's gas production, predicts half of Australia's scheduled LNG export projects will not be launched due to cost pressures and uncertainty over long-term contracts with the Asian market.
In an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial Review, Qatargas chief executive officer Faisal Al Suwaidi said:  Australia is not about to deliver large increases in quantities of LNG every year or two years going into the future.
 They will find it will come in much smaller quantities and about half of these projects are unlikely to proceed. 
Mr Al Suwaidi's comments came on the eve of the APPEA energy conference that begins in Brisbane today.
Although Australia boasts $220 billion of LNG projects in the pipeline, only $65 billion worth of those projects has so far been approved, leading to concern in the industry that some developments may be canned.
Some of Australia's largest companies, including Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy, are involved in 13 new LNG projects which are due to be delivered by 2018 with a combined capacity of 90 million tonnes a year, to take Australia's total capacity beyond 100 million tonnes a year.
Mr Al Suwaidi said this represents an unrealistic ambition.
 Australia will deliver LNG, but it will be in small quantities. I think you would be looking at 3 million or 4 million tonnes a year of new LNG capacity coming onstream,  he said.  They will be doing well to even reach half this [90 million tonne a year] target.
 As for us, well, I don't think the LNG developers of Australia need to be too worried about the threat of Qatar. We are already sold out of our 77 million tonne-a-year target. 
Industry body Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) estimates Australia's LNG projects could fuel a construction boom, creating at least 60,000 jobs at its peak, while Goldman Sachs expects a boost to the nation's economy by 0.25 per cent a year over the next decade.
Mr Al Suwaidi reiterated that Qatar will make a decision in 2014 about whether it will further increase its overall supply of LNG to around 90 million tonnes a year by expanding the capacity of existing LNG processing units.
The veteran energy executive compared Qatar's  great clarity of vision  and abundant supplies of cheap gas with Australia's uncertain cost and supply outlook.
 One small LNG train will cost you billions of dollars. If you are there in Australia and sitting and worrying about whether your costs have gone up or whether LNG prices have gone down in Asia, you'd better leave this business, otherwise you will soon have a heart attack. 
Mr Al Suwaidi's pessimistic outlook is a further blow to an industry hit by the impact of the Rudd government's proposed resources super profits tax, which has delayed at least two major projects worth tens of billions of dollars.
Origin and Santos have already warned that final investment decisions on their onshore coal-seam gas to LNG ventures, due this year, are likely to be deferred, which would represent about a quarter of the production of Australia's planned projects.
Qatar formed joint ventures to develop its vast LNG infrastructure with many of the same oil majors which have partnered with Australian energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and France's Total.
As part of its drive to retain these companies in its energy sector, Qatar last year lowered the tax rate it charges on foreign companies to a flat 10 per cent from a previous level of up to 35 per cent.
 A really important point for us is trust and confidence. In Qatar, once we agree things they don't get changed. We do not go and do funny things and go and ruin the market for ourselves. These [Australian tax] changes come from people who have not been involved in this energy business for long enough. 
While Qatar recognises frailties in Australia's race to produce valuable gas exports, it remains bullish on the forecasts for both demand and pricing in the gas-thirsty Asian region.
 We think there will be a shortage of gas supplies in the next four or five years in both Asia and Europe,  Mr Al Suwaidi said.  Probably the only change is to consider the impact of shale gas in the US, but again that does not worry us. It is a huge market and it can take more LNG. 
Australian developers are banking on International Energy Agency figures which forecast the world's energy demand will increase by 45 per cent between 2006 and 2030. Non-OECD countries account for 87 per cent of that growth, with China promising robust demand growth.
In April Merrill Lynch lifted its forecasts for LNG demand. It now predicts global imports may rise by 22 per cent this year compared with just 4.4 per cent in 2009.
 China and India will need more LNG and, in fact, this market can take more quantity than we can offer them in the short term or medium term,  Mr Al Suwaidi said.
In March Qatar agreed to supply 4 million tonnes a year of LNG to India by 2014 while also diverting supplies from the US to supply China with its first gas supplies in October last year.
 There's no doubt that it is a huge market and Australia will have the chance to sell more and of course we will have the chance to divert more LNG, too, should we choose. 
He said pricing must be viewed as a long-term proposition.
 If we believe this is a long-term business, we should not look to take advantage of one another. Too high a price will make projects uncompetitive. Too low a price will mean projects don't get developed. We must meet in the middle. 
Round table: Tackling the obstacles, page 52
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Australia has the gas resources, but many obstacles stand in the way of ambitious forecasts for exports. Engineering capacity, skilled labour, fiscal uncertainty and customer demand are all issues to be grappled with. Senior executives in Australia's liquefied natural gas industry and an international consultant respond to questions posed by The Australian Financial Review about the prospects for the country's $200 billion of proposed LNG projects.
The participants: Ann Pickard, executive vice-president, upstream, Australia, Royal Dutch Shell Peter Botten , chief executive, Oil Search Rick Wilkinson, president GLNG and Queensland, Santos Frank Harris, global head of LNG, Wood Mackenzie
 Perry Williams, Paul Garvey and Angela Macdonald-Smith posed the questions.
AFR: The wave of new LNG projects proposed in Australia has some industry observers concerned that Asian LNG markets are heading for oversupply. What is your view on the current state of the LNG market, in particular with regard to uncontracted LNG volumes?
ANN PICKARD: You look at the growth and you look at places like Bahrain, Kuwait, Dubai and Indonesia now talking about importing LNG. All these places and Malaysia now are wanting to import LNG, so there's a whole new market that's happening. I see a huge demand coming and I think Australia is in the right place at the right time. So am I absolutely confident on the future of gas demand? I am. Will it be LNG and imported? I think there will be a big role for it to play. But also, what other new technologies are coming on? Those are the things that we'll be watching for.
PETER BOTTEN: We're fully contracted, so that does put us in a very strong position. I do see there's continuing demand within the region, and continuing interest being shown by various customers, especially around 2014-15-type deliveries. We still see the market as measured but it's reasonably strong. The customers are certainly showing further interest to take further gas, across a spectrum of countries, but I do think they're choosy. They're effectively looking for quality, and if they're not getting quality they want equity and they're looking for discounting in pricing. Greater certainty about where the world is heading has provided greater certainty around where gas offtake may go in 2015-16. I must say I'm not at the bullish end of the spectrum, and you need to be cautious.
RICK WILKINSON: I'm very bullish on Asian demand for energy. Within the time-frame of a normal LNG plant, we're expecting Asia's share of world GDP to come close to 50 per cent by 2030. That means that Asia as a part of the world economy will be larger than North America and Europe combined. That's a massive growth rate that's occurring. People tend to get lost in the GFC and the outlook for the next year or two. But when you deal with projects of this size, you think in terms of 20-plus years and then you've got to go back to the fundamental underlying demand drivers. This is the emergence of not just China and India, which are pretty much in our backyard, but all of the other parts of South-east Asia â€“ the ASEAN countries â€“ as those growth rates come on. Historically, they've shown they can grow at quite phenomenal rates and they'll be looking round for where can they source their energy to make that work.
FRANK HARRIS: Our view now for the Pacific basin is that if you look at 2013-15 you've still got something of a sweet spot for the market, so if you can deliver volumes from new projects in that time-frame you should be able to secure an attractive deal. The tipping point now is 2015-16. If you look at demand forecasts and the amount of supply operational, in build and being proposed, there is a theoretical excess of supply relative to demand. You would expect post-2016 there is not enough demand for all the LNG that is being talked up. You would therefore expect to see some downward pressure on prices and some projects to get pushed back.
AFR : How big a competitive threat is Qatar to Australia's LNG supply ambitions?
BOTTEN: I think the demand in Asia will still be there. But as the market across the world grows and matures, clearly Asian markets begin to be affected by other areas, such as the Middle East, Qatar's marketing strategy and what may or may not be happening in North America.
HARRIS: Qatar still has 25 million tonnes a year of LNG out of these new mega-trains nominally allocated to North America but which they could divert long-term into the Asian market if the price is right. At the moment Qatar's demands on price are still higher than most in the basin, but if Qatar was at some stage prepared to change its strategy and take a lower price that could have a significant impact on a number of the Australian projects. They could play the reliability card. All their mega-trains are due to be producing by the end of this year, while a lot of the Australian projects are still to be built.
AFR : How do you expect the surge in shale gas in the US to affect Asian LNG demand growth and the prospects for Australian LNG suppliers?
BOTTEN: In the US, the whole gas market has been very, very negative. There's been a strong change in the technology with shale gas. The application and growth of shale gas in North America cannot be replicated pretty well anywhere else in the world. The time-frame of that change cannot be replicated anywhere else. There are countries with shale gas for sure, but the US has a very tradeable market, it has a very large pipeline system that allows trading, it has access to technology and access to land. Just extrapolating that out to other parts of the world is a little simplistic, but that doesn't mean to say that shale gas and unconventional gas won't play a part in the future. But if that plays a part in the Far East market in the next five years, I seriously doubt that.
HARRIS: There is limited direct impact in terms of Australia and the US as we don't see much scope for Asian LNG going to the North American market. The key impact goes back to Qatar. The fact that shale gas in North America has dramatically reduced the need for LNG imports into the US is helping keep the Henry Hub (US natural gas index) price down. It creates this pool of LNG in Qatar that will be looking to see if it can secure a much more attractive long-term home in Asia. The big impact is that at some stage it may cause Qatar to lower its price a little bit and that could have a direct impact on the projects in Australia.
The other impact is that it is making a lot of people think what the shale gas potential is in China and India. At some stage do they prioritise the development of unconventional gas over imports? Maybe there is a window of opportunity now in China to put LNG in at relatively favourable prices, but somewhere down the line that may change as China develops its unconventional resources in a significant way.
AFR : What are the key impediments to Australia reaching its LNG potential? What steps could the government take to help facilitate the industry's expansion?
PICKARD: We're pretty good with technical uncertainty, as in below-the-ground risk, and we're pretty good with construction risk, but when the rules change then we get nervous. And so things like retention licence, domestic gas issues â€“ all these issues are things where the rules may change. And we like predictability and certainty. You will see investments stop or halt if the rules start changing. I think the people resources needed to construct all of this is going to be a challenge. We need to make sure there's a skilled workforce in place that can deliver all of the growth that's out there. That's a challenge for a project like Prelude, where we would like to see it manned by as many Australians as possible.
BOTTEN: Undoubtedly with a number of these major projects moving forward it certainly will stretch the capacity of skills. I think it will also put substantial stress on some of the costs, and certainly labour costs, in the local market. That's already been seen in the west, with Pluto and Gorgon, and should a number of the Gladstone projects move forward as the protagonists say they will do, I think you're going to see some pressure on skills and trades and some of the salaries. Therefore costs will come under some pressure. I don't see substantial inflation for equipment; It's not like it was three or four years ago. Having recently been through a costing exercise, we're certainly not seeing the same cost pressures as we were seeing in 2006-07.
HARRIS: We see three main impediments: resources, shareholder alignment and the market. We talked about the market. There isn't an infinite market: there will be winners and losers. Shareholder alignment is a factor, particularly over on the western side of Australia, where you have a lot of the big players in multiple developments. Take Browse LNG, you have Shell, Chevron, BP, BHP and Woodside, and most of those companies have got other projects looking for markets in a similar time-frame. Companies have got different priorities and that may make it harder for some of the projects to get developed. In Qatar, those issues don't exist as Qatar Petroleum ensures that projects are developed in a co-ordinated fashion, whereas in Australia it's a free market so corporate interests come more into play. Look at Queensland, for example, with four or five different CSG (coal seam gas) LNG projects competing with one another. That wouldn't happen in Qatar. The issue with resources is just whether you actually can get access to enough to develop all of these projects. It's a big call on engineering procurement and construction resources, and on labour. Even if you can get access it all has an impact on price. There's no way all these Australian projects are going to be developed in the time-frame people are talking. Some of them are going to go backwards.
AFR : What about the resource super profits tax? Do you expect that to slow the pace of development of CSG-LNG projects in Australia?
BOTTEN: There are some question marks on the tax review, and the quicker there's some certainty around that the better.
HARRIS: Based on our analysis, albeit there is a general lack of clarity on what the final measures would be, it has an impact on the net present value and the internal rate of return of projects but it doesn't make them unattractive. It's not as if there are a whole line of projects that now don't make any sense. I think what we're seeing is a lot of posturing. Clearly it creates some additional uncertainty but it's not a show-stopper.
AFR : There are contrasting views within the oil and gas sector about the merits of coal seam gas-to-LNG. How will coal seam gas-based LNG compete against conventional projects and what role will coal seam gas-to-LNG play in both the Australian and global LNG sectors?
PICKARD: I think unconventional gas is coming into its own. I mentioned what we've seen in the US with unconventional gas. It's a very good foundation for domestic gas. What hasn't happened is turning it into LNG and so Australia will be on the cutting edge, the frontier, of taking CSG and turning it into an export product. So I think it will be competitive. I think the technology is what we rely on. That's the thing that makes us different and that's the thing that makes an international oil company different. Being able to take cutting-edge technology all the way across the value chain. To be honest, getting oil out of the ground and putting it in a pipeline or ship or whatever is pretty straight forward. But the integrated gas is still tough to do: sub-surface risk, construction risk, transportation risk, market risk all goes with it. That all has to come together and that's why you see the big players playing in LNG and CSG.
BOTTEN: The abundance of CSG in Queensland is a natural cap on the pricing that you'll see in the domestic market, so it's probably good news for the domestic market that you can't see gas prices going up. Equally, every molecule of gas that's supposedly being touted for LNG is nowhere near the volume that will get into the LNG market in a timely way. On that basis, quality projects with quality resources and quality partners are the ones that are going to make it happen. My belief is it will take a little while longer than certain people think. But I think it will happen progressively. There's enough people who have spent enough money with enough access to technology that there will be undoubtedly a number of these projects that will get up, and the quality ones with the quality resource will likely succeed. I think BG's made substantial strides, but BG has a lot more sophisticated LNG model in terms of marketing and trading than those of other protagonists. That helps them work the CSG into the market in a more sophisticated way than some of the others. I think coal seam gas progressively will get up, but I think there's a leaning towards conventional low-risk projects.
The customers want certainty, certainty of risk, certainty of timing â€“ that's the feedback.
WILKINSON: The calorific value (heating levels) for CSG matches the Atlantic standard (global benchmark), which is fairly widely accepted. There are in fact two countries only â€“ Japan and Korea â€“ where heating value is an issue.The rest of the world is comfortable with the calorific values that are standard in the Atlantic. The trend of LNG is for lower calorific values. So the bringing on of CSG but also Gorgon and Tangguh and even the new trains coming out of Qatar all have a lower calorific value than what we have seen historically.
So I think countries which work with higher heating values will need to consider the overall supply strategy and if they want to maintain diversity of supply, they'll have to come to grips with this. It's not such a big deal. It's about being able to mix a process so there's a capital expenditure and infrastructure in place. Already some of the customers we're talking to have progressed plans to implement exactly that infrastructure that enables them to be more flexible in the sort of LNG which they handle.
HARRIS: We believe that CSG-LNG is going to be developed and it's going to play a role, but it's going to have a limited role. Generally the reaction of Asian buyers to CSG-LNG has been lukewarm. Clearly for the Chinese it's less of an issue. You've got CNOOC in with BG in Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) and PetroChina expected to take a significant volume from its proposed project with Shell, assuming that the Arrow deal closes. The fact the gas is very lean isn't a problem for them and they seem keen to develop their unconventional gas knowledge and capability. If you look at Japan, they have probably been the most lukewarm to CSG-LNG. The Tokyo Gas deal with QCLNG is significant here. It could be viewed as a royal seal of approval for CSG LNG, but I'm not sure really how representative or indicative that deal is of Japanese acceptance of CSG LNG, because it's with BG, and BG has the ability to offer a portfolio guarantee. So we don't see a huge market for CSG-LNG. There still seems to be too much CSG-LNG being proposed relative to the market appetite.
AFR : How well prepared is Australia's labour market to cope with the wave of new LNG projects? How much do you expect labour costs to rise, is there going to be enough labour available, and is the industrial relations climate a concern?
PICKARD: I've been in Qatar and I've seen the boom. It was easier managed, I would guess, in Qatar. It wasn't easy there but it was easier than I imagine it would be in Australia. Obviously there is a bigger population here and in trying to build into an existing area and having the people to do it is always going to be a challenge. I come from Wyoming, which is in a boom right now for unconventional gas and getting the people and infrastructure in is a challenge. So I don't know that it's going to be any easier here than any other place in the world. Instinctively, I think it's going to be pretty tough.
BOTTEN: It's already happening. I don't work here, but clearly you can see a level of involvement from the unions that is much greater than it was two years ago. Undoubtedly as things get tighter, and supply of people gets tighter, there will be further discussion about that. You're already seeing the offshore services sector on the North West Shelf. There's certainly been quite a bit of discussion about potential industrial unrest and how that may be managed by both the state and federal governments as well as other stakeholders such as the unions.
WILKINSON: In terms of constraints, we've announced $50 million support for training and apprenticeships which we feel is an investment Santos has to make for the GLNG (Gladstone LNG) project to get access to the skills and the sort of people and standards we require to make this project work. I know we're working closely with the government, various universities and training areas to make sure we get the right number of people and the skills to go ahead: from drilling engineering through to project engineering to the gas operators. All of these are potential issues if you don't start early on investment in people capital and project capital.
On the high-end technical skill side of things [joint venture partner], Petronas are able to bring to bear their deep understanding, particularly on the LNG side of things. They can bring rotating equipment engineers and expertise in pipelines. They've built very large pipelines around Malaysia, so we get access to that. They have impressive training facilities and we're speaking with them about using that to get to the skill level we need.
AFR : The LNG projects proposed for Australia and PNG could cost over $200 billion to develop. Do you expect access to capital is likely to be a challenge for the sector generally?
PICKARD: We're self-financing but that doesn't mean we don't want the same sort of economic performance that a bank would want. Banks are always looking for assuredness that they will get a return and our shareholders are obviously looking for the same thing. So while capex isn't a big issue for us in needing to borrow from banks, our shareholders want to make sure our money is spent wisely. So we'll put the same sort of assurance around it that a bank will do.
BOTTEN: It depends on the robustness of the project. That's a combination of the resource base, a combination of the protagonists and partners, a combination of the political spectrum in which you sit. I'm sure that there's reasonable appetite out there and I'm sure access to funds will come in from equity raisings but also from some of the normal, more traditional financing. I certainly see the chances for equity raisings for other parties are there. It doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to work out who they are.
HARRIS: I think it is going to be an issue. One of the fallouts from the economic crisis is that the availability of capital is limited. For project finance players in the LNG space, there is a flight to quality. They are looking for blue-chip sponsors, high-quality investment-grade offtakers, sensible projects and limited step-out risks in terms of new technologies, or new ways of doing things. PNG LNG was a big success. But you had Exxon and Oil Search in there, and reputable offtakers.
There is money available for LNG projects, but anything a bit wacky is probably going to be much harder or impossible to finance. So for some of the projects you may see them being done significantly on balance sheet until they are all up and running.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Australia has the gas resources, but many obstacles stand in the way of ambitious forecasts for exports. Engineering capacity, skilled labour, fiscal uncertainty and customer demand are all issues to be grappled with. Senior executives in Australia's liquefied natural gas industry and an international consultant respond to questions posed by The Australian Financial Review about the prospects for the country's $200 billion of proposed LNG projects.
The participants: Ann Pickard, executive vice-president, upstream, Australia, Royal Dutch Shell Peter Botten , chief executive, Oil Search Rick Wilkinson, president GLNG and Queensland, Santos Frank Harris, global head of LNG, Wood Mackenzie
 Perry Williams, Paul Garvey and Angela Macdonald-Smith posed the questions.
AFR: The wave of new LNG projects proposed in Australia has some industry observers concerned that Asian LNG markets are heading for oversupply. What is your view on the current state of the LNG market, in particular with regard to uncontracted LNG volumes?
ANN PICKARD: You look at the growth and you look at places like Bahrain, Kuwait, Dubai and Indonesia now talking about importing LNG. All these places and Malaysia now are wanting to import LNG, so there's a whole new market that's happening. I see a huge demand coming and I think Australia is in the right place at the right time. So am I absolutely confident on the future of gas demand? I am. Will it be LNG and imported? I think there will be a big role for it to play. But also, what other new technologies are coming on? Those are the things that we'll be watching for.
PETER BOTTEN: We're fully contracted, so that does put us in a very strong position. I do see there's continuing demand within the region, and continuing interest being shown by various customers, especially around 2014-15-type deliveries. We still see the market as measured but it's reasonably strong. The customers are certainly showing further interest to take further gas, across a spectrum of countries, but I do think they're choosy. They're effectively looking for quality, and if they're not getting quality they want equity and they're looking for discounting in pricing. Greater certainty about where the world is heading has provided greater certainty around where gas offtake may go in 2015-16. I must say I'm not at the bullish end of the spectrum, and you need to be cautious.
RICK WILKINSON: I'm very bullish on Asian demand for energy. Within the time-frame of a normal LNG plant, we're expecting Asia's share of world GDP to come close to 50 per cent by 2030. That means that Asia as a part of the world economy will be larger than North America and Europe combined. That's a massive growth rate that's occurring. People tend to get lost in the GFC and the outlook for the next year or two. But when you deal with projects of this size, you think in terms of 20-plus years and then you've got to go back to the fundamental underlying demand drivers. This is the emergence of not just China and India, which are pretty much in our backyard, but all of the other parts of South-east Asia â€“ the ASEAN countries â€“ as those growth rates come on. Historically, they've shown they can grow at quite phenomenal rates and they'll be looking round for where can they source their energy to make that work.
FRANK HARRIS: Our view now for the Pacific basin is that if you look at 2013-15 you've still got something of a sweet spot for the market, so if you can deliver volumes from new projects in that time-frame you should be able to secure an attractive deal. The tipping point now is 2015-16. If you look at demand forecasts and the amount of supply operational, in build and being proposed, there is a theoretical excess of supply relative to demand. You would expect post-2016 there is not enough demand for all the LNG that is being talked up. You would therefore expect to see some downward pressure on prices and some projects to get pushed back.
AFR : How big a competitive threat is Qatar to Australia's LNG supply ambitions?
BOTTEN: I think the demand in Asia will still be there. But as the market across the world grows and matures, clearly Asian markets begin to be affected by other areas, such as the Middle East, Qatar's marketing strategy and what may or may not be happening in North America.
HARRIS: Qatar still has 25 million tonnes a year of LNG out of these new mega-trains nominally allocated to North America but which they could divert long-term into the Asian market if the price is right. At the moment Qatar's demands on price are still higher than most in the basin, but if Qatar was at some stage prepared to change its strategy and take a lower price that could have a significant impact on a number of the Australian projects. They could play the reliability card. All their mega-trains are due to be producing by the end of this year, while a lot of the Australian projects are still to be built.
AFR : How do you expect the surge in shale gas in the US to affect Asian LNG demand growth and the prospects for Australian LNG suppliers?
BOTTEN: In the US, the whole gas market has been very, very negative. There's been a strong change in the technology with shale gas. The application and growth of shale gas in North America cannot be replicated pretty well anywhere else in the world. The time-frame of that change cannot be replicated anywhere else. There are countries with shale gas for sure, but the US has a very tradeable market, it has a very large pipeline system that allows trading, it has access to technology and access to land. Just extrapolating that out to other parts of the world is a little simplistic, but that doesn't mean to say that shale gas and unconventional gas won't play a part in the future. But if that plays a part in the Far East market in the next five years, I seriously doubt that.
HARRIS: There is limited direct impact in terms of Australia and the US as we don't see much scope for Asian LNG going to the North American market. The key impact goes back to Qatar. The fact that shale gas in North America has dramatically reduced the need for LNG imports into the US is helping keep the Henry Hub (US natural gas index) price down. It creates this pool of LNG in Qatar that will be looking to see if it can secure a much more attractive long-term home in Asia. The big impact is that at some stage it may cause Qatar to lower its price a little bit and that could have a direct impact on the projects in Australia.
The other impact is that it is making a lot of people think what the shale gas potential is in China and India. At some stage do they prioritise the development of unconventional gas over imports? Maybe there is a window of opportunity now in China to put LNG in at relatively favourable prices, but somewhere down the line that may change as China develops its unconventional resources in a significant way.
AFR : What are the key impediments to Australia reaching its LNG potential? What steps could the government take to help facilitate the industry's expansion?
PICKARD: We're pretty good with technical uncertainty, as in below-the-ground risk, and we're pretty good with construction risk, but when the rules change then we get nervous. And so things like retention licence, domestic gas issues â€“ all these issues are things where the rules may change. And we like predictability and certainty. You will see investments stop or halt if the rules start changing. I think the people resources needed to construct all of this is going to be a challenge. We need to make sure there's a skilled workforce in place that can deliver all of the growth that's out there. That's a challenge for a project like Prelude, where we would like to see it manned by as many Australians as possible.
BOTTEN: Undoubtedly with a number of these major projects moving forward it certainly will stretch the capacity of skills. I think it will also put substantial stress on some of the costs, and certainly labour costs, in the local market. That's already been seen in the west, with Pluto and Gorgon, and should a number of the Gladstone projects move forward as the protagonists say they will do, I think you're going to see some pressure on skills and trades and some of the salaries. Therefore costs will come under some pressure. I don't see substantial inflation for equipment; It's not like it was three or four years ago. Having recently been through a costing exercise, we're certainly not seeing the same cost pressures as we were seeing in 2006-07.
HARRIS: We see three main impediments: resources, shareholder alignment and the market. We talked about the market. There isn't an infinite market: there will be winners and losers. Shareholder alignment is a factor, particularly over on the western side of Australia, where you have a lot of the big players in multiple developments. Take Browse LNG, you have Shell, Chevron, BP, BHP and Woodside, and most of those companies have got other projects looking for markets in a similar time-frame. Companies have got different priorities and that may make it harder for some of the projects to get developed. In Qatar, those issues don't exist as Qatar Petroleum ensures that projects are developed in a co-ordinated fashion, whereas in Australia it's a free market so corporate interests come more into play. Look at Queensland, for example, with four or five different CSG (coal seam gas) LNG projects competing with one another. That wouldn't happen in Qatar. The issue with resources is just whether you actually can get access to enough to develop all of these projects. It's a big call on engineering procurement and construction resources, and on labour. Even if you can get access it all has an impact on price. There's no way all these Australian projects are going to be developed in the time-frame people are talking. Some of them are going to go backwards.
AFR : What about the resource super profits tax? Do you expect that to slow the pace of development of CSG-LNG projects in Australia?
BOTTEN: There are some question marks on the tax review, and the quicker there's some certainty around that the better.
HARRIS: Based on our analysis, albeit there is a general lack of clarity on what the final measures would be, it has an impact on the net present value and the internal rate of return of projects but it doesn't make them unattractive. It's not as if there are a whole line of projects that now don't make any sense. I think what we're seeing is a lot of posturing. Clearly it creates some additional uncertainty but it's not a show-stopper.
AFR : There are contrasting views within the oil and gas sector about the merits of coal seam gas-to-LNG. How will coal seam gas-based LNG compete against conventional projects and what role will coal seam gas-to-LNG play in both the Australian and global LNG sectors?
PICKARD: I think unconventional gas is coming into its own. I mentioned what we've seen in the US with unconventional gas. It's a very good foundation for domestic gas. What hasn't happened is turning it into LNG and so Australia will be on the cutting edge, the frontier, of taking CSG and turning it into an export product. So I think it will be competitive. I think the technology is what we rely on. That's the thing that makes us different and that's the thing that makes an international oil company different. Being able to take cutting-edge technology all the way across the value chain. To be honest, getting oil out of the ground and putting it in a pipeline or ship or whatever is pretty straight forward. But the integrated gas is still tough to do: sub-surface risk, construction risk, transportation risk, market risk all goes with it. That all has to come together and that's why you see the big players playing in LNG and CSG.
BOTTEN: The abundance of CSG in Queensland is a natural cap on the pricing that you'll see in the domestic market, so it's probably good news for the domestic market that you can't see gas prices going up. Equally, every molecule of gas that's supposedly being touted for LNG is nowhere near the volume that will get into the LNG market in a timely way. On that basis, quality projects with quality resources and quality partners are the ones that are going to make it happen. My belief is it will take a little while longer than certain people think. But I think it will happen progressively. There's enough people who have spent enough money with enough access to technology that there will be undoubtedly a number of these projects that will get up, and the quality ones with the quality resource will likely succeed. I think BG's made substantial strides, but BG has a lot more sophisticated LNG model in terms of marketing and trading than those of other protagonists. That helps them work the CSG into the market in a more sophisticated way than some of the others. I think coal seam gas progressively will get up, but I think there's a leaning towards conventional low-risk projects.
The customers want certainty, certainty of risk, certainty of timing â€“ that's the feedback.
WILKINSON: The calorific value (heating levels) for CSG matches the Atlantic standard (global benchmark), which is fairly widely accepted. There are in fact two countries only â€“ Japan and Korea â€“ where heating value is an issue.The rest of the world is comfortable with the calorific values that are standard in the Atlantic. The trend of LNG is for lower calorific values. So the bringing on of CSG but also Gorgon and Tangguh and even the new trains coming out of Qatar all have a lower calorific value than what we have seen historically.
So I think countries which work with higher heating values will need to consider the overall supply strategy and if they want to maintain diversity of supply, they'll have to come to grips with this. It's not such a big deal. It's about being able to mix a process so there's a capital expenditure and infrastructure in place. Already some of the customers we're talking to have progressed plans to implement exactly that infrastructure that enables them to be more flexible in the sort of LNG which they handle.
HARRIS: We believe that CSG-LNG is going to be developed and it's going to play a role, but it's going to have a limited role. Generally the reaction of Asian buyers to CSG-LNG has been lukewarm. Clearly for the Chinese it's less of an issue. You've got CNOOC in with BG in Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) and PetroChina expected to take a significant volume from its proposed project with Shell, assuming that the Arrow deal closes. The fact the gas is very lean isn't a problem for them and they seem keen to develop their unconventional gas knowledge and capability. If you look at Japan, they have probably been the most lukewarm to CSG-LNG. The Tokyo Gas deal with QCLNG is significant here. It could be viewed as a royal seal of approval for CSG LNG, but I'm not sure really how representative or indicative that deal is of Japanese acceptance of CSG LNG, because it's with BG, and BG has the ability to offer a portfolio guarantee. So we don't see a huge market for CSG-LNG. There still seems to be too much CSG-LNG being proposed relative to the market appetite.
AFR : How well prepared is Australia's labour market to cope with the wave of new LNG projects? How much do you expect labour costs to rise, is there going to be enough labour available, and is the industrial relations climate a concern?
PICKARD: I've been in Qatar and I've seen the boom. It was easier managed, I would guess, in Qatar. It wasn't easy there but it was easier than I imagine it would be in Australia. Obviously there is a bigger population here and in trying to build into an existing area and having the people to do it is always going to be a challenge. I come from Wyoming, which is in a boom right now for unconventional gas and getting the people and infrastructure in is a challenge. So I don't know that it's going to be any easier here than any other place in the world. Instinctively, I think it's going to be pretty tough.
BOTTEN: It's already happening. I don't work here, but clearly you can see a level of involvement from the unions that is much greater than it was two years ago. Undoubtedly as things get tighter, and supply of people gets tighter, there will be further discussion about that. You're already seeing the offshore services sector on the North West Shelf. There's certainly been quite a bit of discussion about potential industrial unrest and how that may be managed by both the state and federal governments as well as other stakeholders such as the unions.
WILKINSON: In terms of constraints, we've announced $50 million support for training and apprenticeships which we feel is an investment Santos has to make for the GLNG (Gladstone LNG) project to get access to the skills and the sort of people and standards we require to make this project work. I know we're working closely with the government, various universities and training areas to make sure we get the right number of people and the skills to go ahead: from drilling engineering through to project engineering to the gas operators. All of these are potential issues if you don't start early on investment in people capital and project capital.
On the high-end technical skill side of things [joint venture partner], Petronas are able to bring to bear their deep understanding, particularly on the LNG side of things. They can bring rotating equipment engineers and expertise in pipelines. They've built very large pipelines around Malaysia, so we get access to that. They have impressive training facilities and we're speaking with them about using that to get to the skill level we need.
AFR : The LNG projects proposed for Australia and PNG could cost over $200 billion to develop. Do you expect access to capital is likely to be a challenge for the sector generally?
PICKARD: We're self-financing but that doesn't mean we don't want the same sort of economic performance that a bank would want. Banks are always looking for assuredness that they will get a return and our shareholders are obviously looking for the same thing. So while capex isn't a big issue for us in needing to borrow from banks, our shareholders want to make sure our money is spent wisely. So we'll put the same sort of assurance around it that a bank will do.
BOTTEN: It depends on the robustness of the project. That's a combination of the resource base, a combination of the protagonists and partners, a combination of the political spectrum in which you sit. I'm sure that there's reasonable appetite out there and I'm sure access to funds will come in from equity raisings but also from some of the normal, more traditional financing. I certainly see the chances for equity raisings for other parties are there. It doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to work out who they are.
HARRIS: I think it is going to be an issue. One of the fallouts from the economic crisis is that the availability of capital is limited. For project finance players in the LNG space, there is a flight to quality. They are looking for blue-chip sponsors, high-quality investment-grade offtakers, sensible projects and limited step-out risks in terms of new technologies, or new ways of doing things. PNG LNG was a big success. But you had Exxon and Oil Search in there, and reputable offtakers.
There is money available for LNG projects, but anything a bit wacky is probably going to be much harder or impossible to finance. So for some of the projects you may see them being done significantly on balance sheet until they are all up and running.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"GAS By Kym Agius
BRISBANE, May 18 AAP - Two energy companies planning to open up central Queensland to liquified natural gas (LNG) exports will decide by the end of the year whether to push ahead with the projects.
 Origin Energy and BG Group are both planning multi-billion dollar projects to turn coal seam gas into LNG in Gladstone and exports could begin from 2014.
Company representatives have told the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration conference in Brisbane they will decide whether to proceed with the projects by the end of the year.
Origin Energy managing director Grant King said the federal government's proposed 40 per cent Resource Super Profits Tax had left the industry nervous about new projects.
 The timing ... is extremely unfortunate,  he said of the new tax, announced on May 2 and scheduled to take effect in July 2012.
 We're all at the stage of trying to crystallise what we think are large ... investments for Queensland and Australia.
 (There is) a need to have accelerated, deep discussion with government on how we then deal with that. 
Origin Energy earlier this month said the tax could delay and significantly increase the cost of its planned $35 billion project.
BG Group's executive vice president Catherine Tanna said the company also expected to make a final investment decision by the end of the year, following  environmental approvals .
BG Group has signed a sales contract with China National Offshore Oil Corporation for the supply of 3.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG over 20 years.
Eight organisations have publicly announced Liquified Natural Gas proposals for the state, including seven seeking to export LNG from Gladstone and one planning to export from Abbot Point near Bowen.
Coal seam gas is the methane trapped in coal seams under pressure of water.
By pumping the water out, the gas molecules are released, creating a relatively clean energy that will be used and exported as LNG.
More than 2400 people from 25 countries are meeting in Brisbane for the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration conference, which ends on Wednesday.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"GAS companies will be required to consult more with farmers before they start exploring on their land under laws being introduced in the Queensland parliament this week.
Farmers on the western part of the Darling Downs have been complaining that the state government is favouring companies looking for natural gas deposits at the expense of protecting their farmland.
 Despite the promise of new legal clarity, landowners near Tara on the Western Downs were yesterday sceptical the new laws would bring a change in behaviour by the gas companies.
Queensland Natural Resources, Mines and Energy Minister Stephen Robertson said the laws were aimed at ensuring ``access to land is clear, fair and reasonable to all''.
Under the legislation, companies will be required to notify landholders before stepping on to their property to conduct preliminary activities that ``don't require disturbance of the land''.
If the action is more serious and is ``likely to significantly impact on the land'', companies must negotiate an agreement about ``conduct and compensation'' before accessing the property. If negotiations fail, the issue goes to the Land Court of Queensland.
Rod Matthews, co-founder of the Western Downs Alliance, said the new laws would not resolve the dispute.
``A lot of people don't want to be compensated or shifted,'' said Mr Matthews, who has lived at Tara for almost a decade.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE head of one of the four liquid natural gas projects planned for Gladstone has left the way open for rationalisation of the projects, a view backed by the federal minister overseeing the industry.
Consortia headed by Santos, the BG Group, Origin and Arrow-Shell still have to make final investment decisions on their projects.
 Each has planned an LNG refinery for Curtis Island on the north side of Gladstone Harbour at a cost of about $15 billion each.
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said yesterday he would prefer fewer than four projects on Curtis Island.
``I think that would be to the benefit of the companies and the benefit of the community,'' he said.
``I think it's smart from an economy-of-scale point of view . . . and I think it's smart from an environmental point of view because it reduces the environmental footprint.
``They're commercial decisions for companies to make, but as sure as night follows day I expect that to occur.''
Royal Dutch Shell's new Australian oil and gas head, Ann Pickard, said her company's focus at the moment was the takeover of Arrow.
``I think everyone would be interested in consolidation,'' she said. ``I think we have to do what makes sense.
``That's looking at things like customers -- we have to make sure we have customers lined up, we're in a pretty good position given our relationship with PetroChina -- but also at people to deliver these projects.
``We've got room on Curtis Island for 16 million tonnes, potentially huge, and I look forward to progressing, subject to us getting approvals to go forward with Arrow.''
There is also a strong belief in the industry that not all of the four projects will involve a major refinery at Gladstone.
At a recent industry conference, most of those attending predicted that only two of the four projects would go ahead.
Despite this, however, all four companies are proceeding on the basis that their project will involve an LNG refinery on Curtis Island,

while Queensland government planning is also proceeding on this basis.
Earlier, Queensland Resources Minister Stephen Robertson had told the conference he was concerned the federal government's proposed resource super-profits tax could delay the start-up of the industry.
Ms Packard was generally upbeat about Shell's LNG prospects, pointing out that worldwide demand for LNG would almost double to as much as 400 million tonnes annually by 2020.
Shell aimed to add about 15 million tonnes of LNG capacity a year over the next decade, and ``much of that effort and investment will be focused in Australia, making us one of the biggest investors in the country'', she said.
Queensland's coal-seam gas and LNG industries will be a dominant theme at the conference, with Origin chief Grant King and BG Group's QGC managing director Catherine Tanna due to speak today.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"SHELL vice-president Ann Pickard yesterday all but endorsed the Queensland Government's stance on the controversial resource super profits tax.
Ms Pickard - who is in charge of Shell's proposed Australian liquefied natural gas developments - indicated her company was urging the Federal Government to remodel the tax along the lines of the existing petroleum resources rent tax.
 That was a genuine ``windfall profits tax'' which the oil and gas industry had been able to work with (for two decades), she said after the 50th Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Brisbane.
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser went to Canberra late last week to urge his Federal colleagues to amend their RSPT plan, which envisages the proposed tax cutting in once a company's return on capital reaches the long term government bond rate, currently 5.75 per cent.
Queensland Minister for Natural Resources Stephen Robertson said outside the APPEA conference Mr Fraser was urging that the tax not cut in until return on capital reached 11 per cent, essentially the rate that applies under the PRRT.
There are other differences between the PRRT and the proposed RSPT, but Ms Pickard said the former, was ``a good super tax, while the proposed RSPT is a not so good tax''.
``The PRRT is working pretty well and if you have a tax that's working pretty well, why mess around with it?'' she said.
``Anything modelled on the PRRT would make us happier.''
Shell is in the throes of taking over Queensland's Arrow Energy to give itself and partner PetroChina the raw material for one of four liquefied natural gas plants proposed for Curtis Island in Gladstone harbour.
Like other speakers at the conference, Ms Pickard pointed to the huge investments required to bring on large oil and gas and LNG projects - and said any tax regime needed to acknowledge that and the high risks involved in developments that could take 10 years to get off the ground and as long as that to pay back their capital.
Chevron's Gorgon LNG project in WA is forecast to cost $US40 billion ($45 billion) while the initial ``two train'' plants proposed for Gladstone are likely to cost at least $US15 billion.
Many analysts assume only two of the four proposed Gladstone plants will go ahead in the short term, and other producers will do better to sell their output into those two plants
``Everyone is in favour of consolidation and we'll do what makes sense,'' Ms Pickard said when asked her view on if there was room for four plants.
Shell has many Australian LNG options, given its involvement proposals in Western Australia and the Timor Sea, but Ms Pickard, who was dubbed 25th most powerful business women in the world last year by Fortune magazine, said: ``I happen to like our (Gladstone) site.''
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"US energy giant Chevron is in talks with a host of parties to finalise supply agreements that underpin development of its $20 billion-plus Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project off the north-west coast of Western Australia.
Chevron, which approved the $43 billion Gorgon LNG project in WA last year, is aiming to make a final investment decision on Wheatstone by the middle of next year.
 The company has preliminary supply agreements, accounting for 60 per cent of Wheatstone's expected capacity, with Japanese customers Kyushu Electric Power and Tokyo Electric Power.
But it wants long-term buyers for another 25 to 30 per cent. The remaining 10 to 15 per cent would be sold into the LNG spot market.
 We're actively talking to many different customers and I think we'll have some more news on that front in coming months,  Chevron Australia managing director Roy Krzywosinski said at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Brisbane yesterday.
Mr Krzywosinski said global demand for LNG had  calmed down  in recent months, but that had not affected interest in Wheatstone.
 We're seeing the top-tier customers still interested in the projects out there that have a predictable FID date and a predictable first gas date. That part hasn't changed. 
In a boost for Chevron, federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson confirmed yesterday that the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects, along with the Browse LNG development, in which the company also has an interest, would remain subject to the petroleum resources rent tax. Companies that are taxed under the petroleum rules begin to pay up at a higher level than the proposed resources super profits tax would require, enabling them to keep more of their profits.
But Mr Krzywosinski did not think this had given the company any particular advantage over rivals developing LNG projects in Queensland, which will potentially face the government's proposed resources tax.
Despite the apparent challenges Chevron is facing attempting two multi-billion dollar LNG developments in the same region almost concurrently, Mr Krzywosinski said there were benefits to be gained from the approach.
 When you look at the development schedule, and this moves back and forth, Wheatstone is roughly 20 to 24 months behind Gorgon and we continue to manage it like that because what we see is rollover benefits associated with project execution synergies, people, materials so on,  he said.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"A split is emerging between Australia's oil and gas heavyweights over the urgency of reforming the Rudd government's resources super profits tax (RSPT).
Companies with heavy onshore exposure, including Shell, Santos and Origin Energy, have expressed alarm at the impact of the proposed tax on their pending investments in the fledgling coal-seam gas sector.
 But they are getting little sympathy from energy giants that are already taxed on their offshore operations under the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT).
Both sides lined up yesterday to hear Resources Minister Martin Ferguson pronounce the industry had  largely accepted  the need to pay more tax.
 Up until now there has never been a requirement to have a royalty regime in place for that [coal-seam gas] industry,  he told the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association energy industry conference in Brisbane.  The industry largely accepts the need to pay more tax. 
Onshore developers including Shell, which in March bid $3.45 billion to buy mid-tier CSG firm Arrow Energy, disagreed with Mr Ferguson's appraisal.
The RSPT is  not what I would consider a good super tax , said Ann Pickard, head of Shell's upstream business in Australia.
Ms Pickard accused the government of levying a  windfall profits tax , saying the proposal  has a negative impact on industry across the board .
She said any tax had to take into consideration a company's cost base and the risks it went through to bring a project on-stream.
In contrast to the RSPT, the PRRT does not affect a project until it generates close to a 20 per cent internal rate of return, according to calculations by RBS Morgans. The RSPT starts eating into project valuations at anything above 10 to 11 per cent returns and imposes a much higher tax burden than the PRRT.
A multibillion-dollar coal seam gas-based LNG project that Shell and partner PetroChina are planning in Queensland would be subject to the 40 per cent RSPT, which under the government's current proposal would apply to returns above the long-term bond rate.
Santos and Origin Energy, which are involved in separate LNG projects in Queensland, have already warned their final investment decisions on their projects, due this year, risk being delayed because of the tax.
Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil said it was time the onshore industry faced a similar tax regime.
 I agree with Roy Krzywosinski from Chevron, who said it is valid for governments to engage in striking the right balance in tax take between the resource projects and the communities in which you operate,  said David Eyton, group vice-president for research and technology at BP.
 What we want is something that is pretty stable so that we can make investments of confidence. 
The chairman of ExxonMobil Australia, John Dashwood, said he would not campaign against the tax.  We are not going to be visible and putting huge messages out there about this tax because we do not have the immediate impact and wish to do that,  he said.
KEY POINTS Martin Ferguson says the industry largely accepts the need to pay more tax. Onshore developers disagree with the minister's appraisal.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"SOURCE: ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND
Royal Dutch Shell's new head of exploration and production in Australia insists it will push ahead with the rapid development of its first floating liquefied natural gas project at the Prelude field off the northwest coast, rejecting concerns that the untested process and host of rival projects may deter customers for signing up for the gas.
 LNG from the Prelude field in the Browse Basin  will easily be sold , Ann Pickard, executive vice-president, upstream, at Shell Australia, said yesterday at the APPEA conference in Brisbane.
Shell's international LNG trading company will be able to take all the gas from the project and place it in markets in Asia, she said.
Korea Gas Corp, the world's biggest LNG buyer, is among prospective customers for the project, according to analysts.
Shell is targeting early 2011 to reach a final investment decision on the estimated US$5 billion ($5.7 billion) Prelude LNG project and the start of production in 2016. That puts it on roughly the same time-line as Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia and the US$20 billion Ichthys LNG project planned by Japan's Inpex and France's Total in Darwin.
Shell's proposed coal seam gas-based project in Gladstone with PetroChina, which would use gas supplied by their takeover target Arrow Energy, is also tentatively scheduled around that time. No floating LNG supply projects have yet been built worldwide.
The contentious Sunrise LNG project in the Timor Sea may be the second worldwide to use Shell's FLNG technology as long as approvals can be obtained from the East Timorese and Australian governments, Ms Pickard said, declining to estimate a schedule for the project.
Meanwhile Shell is in talks to use its FLNG technology at other projects in Australia, in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, she added.
Ms Pickard, six weeks into her job after relocating from Shell in Nigeria, refused to comment on whether the Rudd government's resources super profits tax could drive Shell and PetroChina to lower the price of their $3.45 billion cash offer for Arrow Energy, but attacked the harshness of the levy and warned of delays for projects approaching final investment decisions.
 We all tend to stop when there is above-ground uncertainty,  she said.  Any tax that is undertaken must recognise the huge costs and the risks that we take. 
She also rounded on the WA government's intervention in site selection decision by the Browse LNG venture. WA left the partners with little option but to back Woodside's preferred choice of James Price Point on the Kimberley coast if they wanted to retain their offshore leases. Shell had wanted more time to weigh up building a plant at James Price Point and piping the gas about 900 km south to Karratha.  I don't like take-it-or-leave it approaches by government, particularly on the gas side. 
But Ms Pickard left the door open for potential consolidation around Shell and PetroChina's proposed Curtis Island LNG project at Gladstone, signalling scope for cooperation as the project builds up to its expected final capacity of 16 million tonnes per year.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"SANTOS BRISBANE, May 19 AAP - Australia's largest domestic gas producer says it is committed to minimising the impact of coal seam gas exploration on farming.
More than 400 farmers protested at a farm in Cecil Plains near Toowoomba on Wednesday, voicing concerns that water quality and farm production was being negatively affected by coal seam gas exploration and mining.
 They are calling on the state government to impose a moratorium on new developments in the Western Downs and Surat Basin.
Protest organiser Ian Haylor told the ABC that if their demands were not met, farmers would take matters into their own hands and block exploration on their lands.
Chief executive of gas giant Santos, David Knox, said the company had been operating around Roma for 40 years and had worked to protect the environment.
 I want to assure the farmers we will not be doing anything that damages the environment,  he told reporters in Brisbane on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APEA) conference.
 There is an impact, but it is minimal and I would very much like to hope that we can reach an arrangement where everyone feels like this is of benefit.
 Our aim in the Roma community is to make a difference at the end of the day and I hope we've been doing that over the last 30 or 40 years. 
Mr Knox said Santos was extracting gas from the coal seam well below the shallow water table.
 In the Roma area, the water is just below the ground and we're well below that in our coal seam gas, we're down at 600 metres, so that's below the shallow water table,  he said.
 We drill through that, go much deeper, where we extract the gas from the coals.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"HENRY MELBOURNE, May 19 AAP - Santos Ltd has warned its $7.7 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) joint venture project is under a cloud due to the federal government's proposed resources tax.
The gas giant said it needed more information on the government's tax plans before it makes a final investment decision on the project, which is expected to employ 5,000 workers during construction.
  We've been clear that we will take the time to assess the impact of the proposed new tax on GLNG,  Santos chief executive officer David Knox said on Wednesday.
 I have also said that we will take a final investment decision this year,  Mr Knox told the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association (APPEA) conference in Brisbane.
 To enable that, it will be important that we get greater clarity on the tax regime we can expect going forward,  he said, according to speech notes released through the Australian stock exchange.
The federal government has proposed a new tax of 40 per cent on super profits of resources companies, forecast to reap $12 billion in its first two years.
Santos expects GLNG, located on Queensland's central coast, to eventually produce 7.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG with a maximum potential production of 10 mtpa.
The company holds a 60 per cent stake in the project, with Malaysia's Petronas holding the remaining 40 per cent.
Mr Knox also told APPEA that if Australia remained competitive, in just eight years the nation's liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity could surpass that of Qatar, the world's leader in the market.
He said new capacity in Australia would jump significantly from 2014, as the Gorgon project offshore from Western Australia begins production and coal seam gas fields in Queensland come online.
 According to estimates from PFC Energy, a mere four years later, around 2018, Australia's LNG liquefaction capacity will surpass that of Qatar currently the world's largest producer,  Mr Knox said.
 That forecast really underlines the extraordinary nature of the opportunity before us right now,  he said.
While Australia has about 89 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven gas reserves, it has another 250tcf of so-called unconventional gas from sources such as coal seam methane.
Qatar has total reserves of about 900tcf while Russia has the world's largest reserves, estimated at 1,529tcf.
Mr Knox urged governments to use gas more for power generation, and said Australia was underweight in natural gas use compared to other nations.
Nine per cent of Australia's power was generated by gas, compared to 20 per cent in the United States, 64 per cent in Malaysia and 78 per cent in Thailand, Mr Knox said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"SANTOS BRISBANE, May 19 AAP - Santos says it is very close to signing a new customer for its Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) venture.
However, the nation's third-largest oil and gas producer also says it wants the uncertainty over the federal government's proposed new mining tax resolved.
 Chief executive David Knox said Santos was in  active negotiations  with a number of customers that wanted to buy gas or an equity stake in the GLNG project.
The project involves the construction of two coal seam gas extraction sites near Roma and Injune in central eastern Queensland and an LNG processing plant on Curtis Island near Gladstone.
 We're working with customers who want to join our partnership from the coal face all the way to the export point and obviously in that we are seeking to secure offtake as well,  Mr Knox said on Wednesday.
 Those discussions have been made quite a bit more difficult by the impost of the new income tax,  he told reporters on the sidelines of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) conference in Brisbane.
 This period of uncertainty is extremely difficult to manage and we need to resolve that uncertainty with great speed in order to be able to move forward.
 The main issue is how do you value the equity when we cannot clearly define the tax right now? 
Nevertheless, Mr Knox said Santos was  very close  to signing another customer.
 We are able to do it, but you do that through other commercial agreements,  he said.  Commercial agreements just get more complicated. 
Malaysia's national oil and gas company Petronas owns a 40 per cent stake in GLNG.
It has agreed to buy two million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG a year for 20 years for the Asian market, with first exports planned by 2014.
The project will initially produce 3.6 million tonnes per annum of LNG, with a maximum potential production of 10 mtpa.
Mr Knox said Santos was still in discussions to sell a nine per cent equity stake in the venture, but was willing to sell a higher proportion if the right buyer was found.
 If I can attract the right partner I am prepared to sell more,  he said.
Any sale above nine per cent would need the approval of Petronas.
A final investment decision on the project was due mid-year but Mr Knox said that had been pushed back to second half of the year.
 The tax is a factor in that decision,  he said.
He said work was continuing to finish the project's environmental impact statement and gain approval from the state and federal governments.
The project is expected to create 5,000 jobs during construction and sustain more than 1,000 jobs during operation.
APPEA predicts the coal seam gas industry in Queensland will attract over $40 billion in new investment and create 18,000 new jobs.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"THE Federal Government's proposal to introduce a so-called resources super profits tax couldn't have come at a worse time for Origin Energy's plans to turn its huge coal seam gas reserves into liquefied natural gas for export.
Origin managing director Grant King and other speakers at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Brisbane said Australia had to overcome significant challenges ``to capture this opportunity'' - which has seen four large LNG plants fuelled by coal seam gas proposed for Gladstone.
 Mr King said the timing of the tax announcement was ``extremely unfortunate'' for the APLNG joint venture ``when we are trying to crystallise an important project for Queensland and Australia''.
Origin and the other three Gladstone hopefuls are planning to make final investment decisions on their projects this year, or possibly a little later in Shell's case.
Mr King made it clear that wouldn't happen unless the uncertainty created by the tax announcement was resolved.
``It would be good if that happened tomorrow,'' he said. ``But I think the Government now understands the urgency.''
The Government has said it intends to have legislation to impose the tax drafted by late next year. ``We compete against other projects, and particularly other countries with projects, and we are at a competitive disadvantage whilst this uncertainty exists,'' Mr King said.
Meanwhile, BG Group, which many analysts consider the frontrunner in Gladstone, said it still expected to make its final investment decision this year, provided environmental approvals were forthcoming.
New LNG projects in the region were ``still highly feasible'', according to Queensland Gas chief and head of BG's Australian LNG operations Catherine Tanna. But they needed ``a supportive fiscal and regulatory environment'', which they had under Queensland's royalty system. ``But we are now assessing whether the RSPT can provide similar support.''
Ms Tanna also made it clear that the many LNG proposals in Australia and offshore in the region would not be feasible on current projected demand.
``New and expansion projects in the Asia-Pacific and volumes of LNG that could supply key (Asian) markets from outside the region could amount to more than 250 million tonnes of LNG a year,'' she said.
``Yet, looking out to 2020, demand . . . not already satisfied by existing contracts would total only about 65 million tonnes a year.''
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"FARMERS have threatened to blockade billions of dollars of coal seam gas development unless the State Government imposes a moratorium and delivers answers on environmental issues on the Western Downs and Surat Basin.
More than 200 farmers are expected to rally at Cecil Plains, west of Toowoomba, today to voice their anger and demand more science is done on the gas industry's impact on some of the state's best cropping land and the vital Great Artesian Basin.
 Basin Sustainability Alliance chairman Ian Hallyor said if the Government did not impose a moratorium ``we will do our own''. ``We will blockade every site they want to go on,'' he said.
The coal seam gas development feeds not only domestic gas consumption but also planned liquefied natural gas export plants at Gladstone which could provide more than $55 billion worth of development and 18,000 jobs.
But it must access farmland, drill holes and build wells, roads, pipelines, dams and compression stations. Some of it is on the best cropping land west of Toowoomba.
The rally will be held on a property that is expected to lose about 40ha of land for gas operations.
The owners would receive compensation of about $50,000 a year but the economic loss was more like $500,000, Mr Hallyor said.
``No one will buy a farm with a gas well on it. The value is virtually zero,'' he said. ``It's going to affect hundreds of properties.''
The blockade threat came as Natural Resources Minister Steven Robertson said that he could not rule out burying salt - which was a byproduct of the CSG production - in landfill even though he was adamant that no environmental damage would be done.
``Development cannot come at any cost,'' Mr Robertson said. ``The development of that industry . . . must be environmentally sustainable.''
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"UK gas giant BG thinks it will be better placed than some of its rivals in Queensland's emerging liquefied natural gas industry to succeed in a regional market that experts warn may be plagued by oversupply for many years.
New and emerging LNG producers are at a disadvantage to their more established competitors because customers prefer to purchase from sources that can guarantee security of supply, Catherine Tanna, managing director of BG's QGC subsidiary, which is developing an LNG project in Queensland and has a worldwide portfolio of LNG supplies, told the APPEA conference in Brisbane. Producers with a range of supply options can lever their portfolio to ensure the most competitive supply, she added.
 BG, which already produces LNG in countries including Egypt and Trinidad, has been the most successful of the crowd of proposed gas export ventures in Gladstone in attracting customers.
Its Queensland Curtis LNG venture is now sold out, having signed supply agreements with Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp and Japan's Tokyo Gas and has accords also to supply fuel to Singapore and Chile.
In contrast, the GLNG venture between Santos and Petronas has been seeking a second customer for about a year, while the Australia Pacific LNG venture between Origin Energy and US company ConocoPhillips has yet to attract any buyers.
Royal Dutch Shell's Gladstone project with PetroChina, while following a later timeline, also benefits from the backing of Shell's global LNG portfolio. According to BG's estimates, LNG supply from new and proposed expansion projects in Asia-Pacific, together with volumes that could be imported into the region, could total more than 250 million tonnes a year.
That compares with only about 65 million tonnes a year of demand in the region out to 2020 that is not already satisfied by existing contracts, Ms Tanna said.
 LNG demand remains healthy but numerous LNG projects in Australia and other countries are competing for this demand,  she said, reiterating BG's intention to reach a final investment decision on its QCLNG project this year.
Warnings of increased supply competition for Australian LNG ventures from outside Asia also came from experts including Deloitte's global head of oil and gas Adi Karev, and IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates' John Harris.
The boom in shale gas in North America may drive LNG originally targeted for export to the US to be redirected to Asia, Mr Karev said.
LNG demand growth is simply insufficient to support the host of proposed projects in Australia within their targeted timeframes, which will inevitably result in a  shake-out  in the order projects start up, said Craig McMahon of oil and gas industry consultants Wood Mackenzie.
With this in mind, the extra burden imposed by the Rudd government's proposed resource super profits tax couldn't have come at a worse time, particularly for the three LNG projects in Queensland, representing about $50 billion of investment, that are scheduled to reach a final investment decision this year, he said. Santos and Origin have already warned of potential delays to final investment decisions on their Queensland LNG projects because of the RSPT.
Ms Tanna confirmed the UK company is also still targeting this year to sanction the QCLNG project, while underlining the need for a  supportive  fiscal regime.
That has already been provided by the Queensland resources royalty system.  Now we find ourselves evaluating whether the RSPT can also provide the right environment,  she said.
While the GLNG venture is ahead of QCLNG in the environmental approvals process, the environmental impact statement for QCLNG is under  final consideration  by the Coordinator-General, Ms Tanna added.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"WA PERTH, May 20, AAP - Ongoing strength in the iron ore market and the ramp-up in construction of Chevron's $43 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will underpin a pick-up in Western Australia's economic growth in coming years, the state government says.
Royalty income from iron ore, the state's main export, is tipped to rise strongly in the forthcoming financial year due to a recent surge in prices for the bulk commodity.
  Total iron ore royalties are projected to grow by 55.6 per cent or $956 million to $2.7 billion in 2010/11,  the Colin Barnett-led government said in budget papers handed down on Thursday.
 In the outyears, iron ore royalties are expected to consolidate at a high level.
 Iron ore royalties have decreased so far in 2009/10, with a substantial rise in the $US/$A exchange rate and a reduction in benchmark prices during the 2009/10 Japanese financial year offsetting a strong rise in the volume of iron ore shipments.
 However, a recent surge in prices means that iron ore royalties are set to rebound sharply in 2010/11. 
The state government said it expected a June quarter iron ore price of about $US115 per tonne, up about 90 per cent on last year's benchmark price.
 The sharp escalation in prices reflects strong international demand, especially in China, against a backdrop of a relatively limited global supply response, even though domestic production has increased strongly in 2009/10.
 This partly reflects a relatively low base in 2008/09 (due to the global financial crisis), as well as solid contributions from recently completed projects including BHP Billiton's Rapid Growth Project 4 and expansions at Rio Tinto's projects. 
Total iron ore shipments for 2009/10 are flagged to have risen 20.3 per cent to 379 million tonnes. The WA government expects iron ore shipments will continue to rise over the outyears at an annual average increase of 8.1 per cent per annum.
The positive outlook, however, does not account for the impact of the federal government's proposed Resources Super Profit Tax (RSPT), which continues to draw ire from mining identities.
These include Fortescue Metals Group Ltd chief executive Andrew Forrest, who told a conference in Perth on Thursday that his $12 billion company  could not have got up  if the planned new tax regime had been in place in years past.
The RSPT was announced after the WA government's economic forecasts for its budget had been finalised.
 There is a risk that the RSPT - and the uncertainty leading up to its planned introduction - could deter investment in the state's resources sector,  it said.
The global move away from an annually negotiated iron ore pricing system to a quarterly arrangement added further uncertainty to the revenue forecasts.
 The global economic environment also remains a key risk,  the WA government said.
It also flagged a 31.9 per cent or $10 million rise in petroleum royalties in 2010/11, with higher energy prices offsetting a modest decline in production.
Petroleum royalties are tipped to grow by 4.2 per cent and 3.6 per cent in 2011/12 and 2012/13, respectively, before contracting by 5.3 per cent in 2013/14, due to an expected decline in production from maturing gas and oil fields, which is expected to counter the impact of higher prices.

 Ian Haylor from the Basin Sustainability Alliance says the Government needs to call a moratorium on new developments until these issues are addressed.
 But if the Government ignores us we're not sure what action we'll take but we're here to protect the environment, protect the Great Artesian Basin and protect the communities of the Surat Basin,  he said.
Natural Resources Minister Stephen Robertson says new laws introduced into Parliament this week will help protect farmers' rights when their land is accessed for exploration.
"
APNWTM,Western Times,2010,2,"The Basin Sustainability Alliance has been formed to support individuals, landholder groups and communities concerned about the rapid development of the coal seam gas industry.
This group, which claims to have wide representation from across the Surat Basin, is calling for a moratorium on further Coal Seam Gas development until the full environmental impacts on communities, groundwater systems and agricultural land are understood and addressed.
 During the gas extraction process, it has been forecast that 40,000 wells will extract up to 350,000 megalitres of water from the Great Artesian Basin annually.
Chairman of the Alliance, Ian Hayllor said taking this magnitude of water away from this groundwater system each year will have a significant impact on the sustainability of the whole Basin.
The Great Artesian Basin supports over 400,000 people from Qld and NSW in their daily lives and underpins over $3.5 billion of Queensland's annual food and fibre production.
Mr Hayllor said waste products, including two million tonnes of salt, will be produced annually as part of the gas extraction process.
â€œThis increase in salt load far exceeds natural resource management targets for salt load in the Murray Darling Basin approved by the state and commonwealth governments,â€? he said.
â€œWhen multiplied over the 20 to 30 year life span of the industry, these figures clearly show that in its current form the coal seam gas industry is unsustainable.â€?
Mr Hallyor questions how clean and green coal seam gas is when you look at the potential groundwater and environmental impacts on the Australian landscape.
â€œThe State Government admits that there are currently no acceptable plans for the management of the waste by-products created by the burgeoning CSG industry,â€? he said.
â€œDespite this, multinational CSG companies are expanding at break neck pace in Queensland on the premise that all will be well.
â€œClearly the government has a leadership responsibility to address the many unanswered questions before any further activity takes place.â€?
Member for Warrego Howard Hobbs said â€œConcerns about gas wells on prime agricultural irrigation land, proposals to construct wastewater ponds on floodplains, homes being damaged by gas drilling activities, affects on the Great Artesian Basin water supply, a number of reports of artesian water bores collapsing, water bores producing more gas than water, reductions in land valuations are all valid concerns that must be urgently addressed by the State Government and the LNG Companies.â€? Following a number of on ground inspections and complaints Mr Hobbs said the LNP State Opposition will seek a number of assurances in the Parliament from the State Government in relation to the LNG Industry.
Mr Hobbs said â€œI am seeing first hand some arrogant behaviour by some of these companies and their cavalier attitude is unacceptable and as far as I'm concerned they are on notice.
â€œFurther compounding the environmental concerns is the fact that the State Labor Government have sat on their hands for three years on legislative reform governing the coal seam gas industry.
â€œSome of the concerns being raised now about gas wells on irrigation land, and floodplains, and impacts on the artesian water supplies would not be occurring if the State Government had acted on recommendations from their own reports.
â€œThe current legislative framework is not satisfactory to mitigate the serious environmental impacts that more than 30 to 40 thousand gas wells across the Surat Basin can cause.
â€œThe security and reliability of water in the Artesian Basin is of critical importance to the majority of inland Queensland towns and individuals and already millions of dollars has been spent rehabilitating this Basin - we don't want to make the same mistakes again,â€? Mr Hobbs said.
Mr Hobbs said the LNP had released a five plank policy for the protection of prime agricultural land and would strengthen its policy position on the CSG industry and â€œpush this tired and lazy State Government to move faster and the LNG companies to pick up their act and mitigate the environmental concerns.â€?

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"TWO Woodside executives failed in an attempt to deliver the company's voluminous development plan for a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the Timor Sea's Greater Sunrise field to the regulator of East Timor's petroleum industry at an acrimonious meeting in Dili.
The independent National Petroleum Authority (NPA) has demanded that Woodside apologise for the behaviour of the executives at yesterday's meeting.
 The authority's president, Gualdino da Silva, told BusinessDay that Woodside executives Jon Ozturgut and Brendan Augustin left the meeting without saying goodbye or shaking hands after he told them he could not accept the plan, prompting extraordinary scenes outside.
 It was embarrassing,  Mr da Silva said.
Mr Ozturgut, senior vice-president for Sunrise LNG Development, and Mr Augustin, Woodside's in-country East Timor manager, left the folders on a table in the authority's office at the Prime Minister's complex in Dili.
But Mr da Silva said he asked his security guard to return the folders to the men after they had got into their vehicle outside the complex.
Mr da Silva said Mr Ozturgut pushed the folders back out of the vehicle's window.
The guard then threw the folders back on to a seat in the vehicle through the driver's door.
The vehicle left with the folders inside.
A Woodside spokesman described the meeting as  cordial  and said there was no walkout. He declined to comment on the demand for an apology.
Mr da Silva said he explained to Mr Ozturgut and Mr Augustin at the meeting that he could not accept the plan to develop a floating platform when, under the Greater Sunrise joint venture agreement, the stakeholders, including East Timor and Australia, had to consider all three possible development proposals. These included piping the gas to either a processing plant on East Timor or to an existing plant in Darwin.
 I told them the NPA was not in a position to accept the folders and they must take them back because they have not done all their homework,  Mr da Silva said.
The setback for Woodside follows angry condemnation by East Timor's leaders of the company's announcement last month that it had decided to develop a floating platform above the field. The leaders say they will approve the project only if the gas is piped to East Timor, which would boost economic development in the tiny nation of 1 million people.
But Woodside chief executive officer Don Voelte has insisted that under an agreement signed only 2Â½ years ago, East Timor cannot walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal.
The NPA, which regulates the Timor Sea joint development area for East Timor and Australia, told Woodside last month it had failed to comply with its legal obligations before announcing its decision to build one of the world's first floating LNG platforms.
The East Timorese government has lodged a complaint with the ASX claiming that Woodside has not given the public and press accurate information about the Greater Sunrise project.

It appears ironic that the State Government has this week released new laws and a new well-head safety program after the Natural Resources, Mines and Energy minister Stephen Robertson received a roasting by 60 Minutes journalist Liz Hazes on national television last Sunday.
 The rate of movement in which the industry is travelling has left most baffled as to which way to turn now.
People power is starting to gather momentum and everyone, including the media, will need to keep up as many final annoucements grow ever closer.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,2,"Readers tell us what they think about the issues of the week
Premier Anna Bligh's very vocal support for the Coal Seam Gas (CSG) industry that is facing Kevin Rudd's new super tax should be very concerning for every man, woman and child living in Queensland.
 The Coal Seam Gas industry is proposing multibillion dollar developments across much of inland Australia; blind Freddy could see that development on this scale will have massive environmental impact.
Many of these impacts are not yet understood; in fact the State Government is only now about to fund research into ground water impacts even though they have already approved many CSG developments.
The purpose of this research is to understand how to manage all the potential ground water impacts, but it could take many years to complete.
What we do know is that the CSG companies will have to pump up to 350,000 megalitres of water out of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) to access the gas and deposit up to two million tonnes of salt on the surface annually.
The State Government has signed the GAB Water Resource Plan which states in the foreword that â€œThe plan ensures that the release of any new water from the basin does not put at risk the natural assets of springs. Includes arrangements for protecting existing entitlements and any further development will be managed within sustainable levels.â€?
The plan clearly states in Schedule 5 General Reserve that NO allocation is to be made from the Eastern Downs Walloons coal measures and the Surat East Walloon coal measures (which are parts of the GAB).
The water resource plan is obviously being ignored by the government.
Why is this allowed to happen?
The Premier should be more interested in protecting the Great Artesian Basin and Queensland's environment for current and future generations rather than so enthusiastically promoting and protecting the CSG industry.

Working together
State Education Week will be celebrated in Queensland from May 24 to 28 this year.
The week is a time when local communities are encouraged to reconnect with their local schools and celebrate all the great work that happens in Queensland's State schools â€“ schools where most children learn and most teachers teach.
This work encompasses much more than traditional academic studies; it also includes learning about almost every aspect of modern life, a huge range of artistic, sporting and vocational activities and community outreach programs.
When local schools and local communities work together, everyone benefits.

Thank you
Thank you 60 Minutes for exposing the mining practices of QGC,Origin and Arrow to Australia. Minister Robertson it seems wouldnt know a Coal Seam Gas mine if he fell over it.
It's a shame the miners were too embarrassed to face the public.
Must have something to hide.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"REGIONAL councils in the midst of a resource boom are calling on the State and Federal governments to put some of the royalties back into their communities.
Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown said while the State and Federal governments pocketed huge royalties from mining and liquefied natural gas and coal seam gas projects, the communities most affected were watching their infrastructure crumble under the weight.
 ``At the moment we are destroying Toowoomba because of all the trucks going through there,'' he said.
Cr Brown said traffic movement on the Warrego Hwy was doubling each year but little money was being spent in upgrading the major piece of infrastructure.
``The Warrego Hwy has had 1376 accidents in the past 10 years and 17 deaths and it's still not getting any funds,'' he said.
``A lot of our infrastructure, particularly roads, are being destroyed . . . we need a far greater contribution.''
Councils were also struggling to expand infrastructure to meet the influx of energy workers.
``We have towns that are about to double in size and we've got to put water and sewerage in with no government subsidies.''
Cr Brown said his and other regional councils had been working with the State Government and the energy sector to work out a better deal but any headway made was now in jeopardy because of the Federal Government's proposed resource tax.
He said councils were also struggling to determine a way to rate the energy companies for the land they were using. Queensland councils will meet today to work out a strategy to ensure communities are not left behind.
In Western Australia the state gives 25 per cent of its royalties from the energy sector back to the regions.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"FARMERS on the Darling Downs are gearing up for the fight of their lives to prevent their land falling victim to the gas mining boom.
More than 500 farmers at a protest meeting yesterday called for the State Government to place a moratorium on coal seam gas mining.
 They lined up 1km of machinery around a paddock at Cecil Plains, west of Toowoomba, to show they had the strength to stop miners at the farm gate.
Up to 40,000 gas wells are proposed for some of the state's best food-producing land on the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane.
Protest organiser Dave Armstrong said farmers were ready to fight to protect their land. ``What choice do we have?'' he said. ``They've backed us into a corner.''
But Mines Minister Stephen Robertson was standing firm, saying the industry had the potential to be one of Queensland's biggest job generators and the Government was committed to supporting it.
Mr Robertson said he understood the concerns but after a decade of production there was no evidence of significant environmental harm.
Conservationists and growers said they could not understand why the Government would give absolute support to an industry that was expected to last about 20 years when farming would sustainably feed the nation indefinitely.
Describing mining as a cancer, the Surat Basin farmers say their livelihoods and homes are at risk because of non-existent controls and a lack of research on impacts.
In extracting gas from deep coal seams, countless billions of litres of polluted water are brought to the surface. Drilling also threatens other aquifers.
Mr Armstrong said industrialisation of the state's best farmland was wrong.
``I can't see that mining royalties will even cover the cost of infrastructure,'' he said.
``This is job relocation, not job creation.''
Mr Armstrong's wife, Ruth, a scientist, said no research had been done to determine aquifer damage or to clarify what would be done with polluted water. ``They can drill and they can mine over my smouldering bones,'' she said.
Farmer Graham Clapham said miners had might and the Government on their side.
``But if it comes to a fight, we will keep them off,'' he said.
Mr Robertson said all exploration and production was subject to strict environmental assessment under some of Australia's toughest legislation and that the Government would ensure companies met their responsibilities.
Conservationist Drew Hutton said the Government's unreserved support for mining showed it was both lazy and incompetent. ``The Government should not be allowed to get away with this,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"SANTOS chief executive David Knox yesterday reinforced the chorus against the Government's proposed 40 per cent resources super profits tax, saying it had disrupted negotiations with potential customers of its proposed $15 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas plant.
But he seemed to assume that the tax would be applied in time, saying what the resources industry needed was ``clarity on how it would be applied, and not just to the group's planned Gladstone LNG plant but to our whole Australian business''.
 Mr Knox said he wasn't interested in some sort of deal that might carve out coal seam gas and give it a special tax deal.
For the proposed Gladstone LNG plant, Santos remained ``very close'' to locking in one or more new customers, he said.
But he told reporters, after addressing the 50th Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Brisbane, the tax proposal ``has not been helpful in moving this forward''.
Without clarity on the tax's likely impact, Mr Knox said, ``the difficulty is to value equity in the project''.
Mr Knox confirmed that uncertainty about the tax had forced Santos to push its Gladstone final investment decision target back to late 2010, from its previous ``mid-year'' target.
Mr Knox said Santos was in talks with ``quite a number of people'' about gas sales and ``a smaller number about possibly joining our partnership''.
``To enable that, it is important that we get far greater clarity on the tax regime before we can go forward,'' Mr Knox said.
Sinopec, the China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, said on Tuesday that it was in off-take negotiations with Santos and its Malaysian partner in the Gladstone project, Petronas.
Sinopec Chairman Su Shulin said the company had also held talks with Qatar, the world's major competitor to Queensland as an LNG hub. But reportedly the biggest hurdle so far in negotiations with potential suppliers had been price.
Santos is also talking to potential Japanese, South Korean and other Chinese buyers.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,2,"AUSTRALIAN mining companies are applying the blowtorch to the Federal Government over its proposed tax changes, announcing a host of projects may not go ahead.

 Iron ore heavyweight Fortescue Metals Group Ltd said it might sell projects put on hold to foreign firms.
BHP Billiton Ltd chief Marius Kloppers said investments slated for major projects in Australia could go offshore.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,2,"GAS
THE Santos chief executive, David Knox, says a deal with a potential buyer is still  very close  but has been hampered due to the federal government's proposal for a resource rent tax, pushing out a final investment decision on its $8 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas plant until  the second half of the year .
 Santos had been aiming for a decision by midyear but he said a number of factors, including the proposed 40 per cent profits-based tax, had made that unachievable.
Mr Knox said engineering issues had also delayed a decision.
 We are very close [to securing a buyer],  he said.  I must say the new income tax, as I call it, has not been helpful in moving us forward. We are in active negotiations with a number of customers. They have to take into account the impact of the tax. The key challenge there is the uncertainty.
 We have been saying for some time that it would be midyear. We are now saying that it will be achieved in the second half of this year. The tax is a factor in the slipping of that decision; it is not the only thing that has been important,  he said.
The Gladstone project is expected to start producing 3.5 million tonnes of LNG a year from 2014. It is dependent on gaining environmental approval and a positive final investment decision.
Santos's venture partner, Petronas, has agreed to take 2 million tonnes of LNG a year from the project.
Mr Knox said he had already had discussions with Petronas's new chief executive, Shamsul Azhar Abbas, who was  extremely supportive  of the project but told him that Malaysia was relying on gas to be delivered by 2014 to meet its energy needs.
He said Santos was prepared to sell more than 9 per cent of equity in the project, with the support of Petronas, if the right partner could be found.
However, he agreed with the Origin Energy managing director, Grant King, who said this week that potential consolidation in the Queensland coal seam gas to LNG sector was unlikely in the short term.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"One of Australia's leading petroleum companies has revealed that the Rudd government's resource super profits tax is hurting negotiations with customers in Asia, sending warning signs that it will take a toll on the country's ambitious liquefied natural gas expansion plans.
Live talks under way between Santos and prospective customers for its Gladstone LNG project in Queensland have become bogged down because the proposed resource super profits tax ( RSPT) is making it difficult to value the stake of at least 9 per cent in the project that would be sold as part of the deal, Santos chief executive David Knox said.
 While an agreement is  very close  the RSPT  has not been helpful in moving this forward , he said.
 The main issue is around how do you value equity when we cannot clearly define the tax right now,  he said.  This period of uncertainty is extremely difficult to manage and we need to resolve that uncertainty with great speed. 
Queensland's $70 billion of coal seam gas-based LNG projects are set to be the hardest hit of Australia's overcrowded line-up of proposed gas export ventures by the RSPT because offshore projects are covered by an existing petroleum rent tax.
The plants already face tough competition from rivals around Asia and potentially from exporters outside the region such as heavyweight producer Qatar.
Multinationals BG and Royal Dutch Shell this week joined with analysts in warning that Asia's market demand is insufficient to underpin all Australia's $220 billion of proposed LNG ventures on their targeted time line.
It is  unbelievably important  for the whole coal seam gas industry that a  sustainable  tax base is put in place, not just for the GLNG project, Mr Knox said.  It's a huge investment; we are on the cusp of something really special and now is the time to grasp it,  he said, also pointing to the wider threat to Australia's  AAA advantage in natural gas  from the RSPT.
The latest hitch in the LNG customer talks comes at a critical time for Santos and partner Petronas, which are due to reach a final investment decision later this year on their estimated $16 billion project.
They have already deferred the timing of the go-ahead to the second half of the year from mid-2010, partly because of the RSPT. The partners have been seeking a second customer for their project for about a year to underpin a second LNG production unit.
Origin Energy, a partner in a rival coal seam gas-based LNG project in Queensland, has also warned of a possible delay in the go-ahead for its venture with ConocoPhillips because of the tax.
While the details of the RSPT may take 18 months to firm up, Mr Knox said he still expected to be able to reach a deal with a customer and be able to reach a final investment decision this year on GLNG.
 We're entering into discussions. I've spoken to a lot of ministers, a lot of government officials, and I'm confident that we will be able to be able to resolve this,  Mr Knox said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Clough chief executive John Smith has warned that Australia risks forgoing major economic benefits from oil and gas development unless attention is given to growing the associated services sector.
In a speech at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Brisbane on Wednesday, Mr Smith lamented the lack of a significant  indigenous  oil and gas services sector at a time when $220 billion in liquefied natural gas projects were on the drawing board.
  The reality is that the requisite expertise and capacity does not reside in Australia, but we are facing a 50-year opportunity at least,  he said. Mr Smith joined Perth-based Clough in 2007 after spending more than 20 years working for Brown and Root companies in locations such as Norway and the UK.
He held up Norway as an example of how a country could fully capitalise on nearby oil and gas developments to build an international-standard services industry that was a major contributor to the economy.
 The first major developments in Norway in the 1970s and early 1980s were designed and constructed by the French and the Americans,  he said.
 But from there on, not only have the Norwegians taken charge of their own domestic industry, they've built a service sector that now exports to every oil and gas province around the globe, providing many thousands of highly skilled jobs.
 This has been achieved in a country of four million people where, pre oil and gas, the primary industries were fishing and shipping. 
Mr Smith said the Oslo stock exchange featured 45 oil and gas services companies with a combined market capitalisation of $50 billion.
By contrast, only five companies on the Australian Securities Exchange can claim to specialise in servicing the oil and gas industry. Their combined market value is around $8 billion, with WorleyParsons accounting for $6.4 billion of that.
 There are several general construction companies that dabble at the periphery of the oil and gas sector, providing services that practically can only be supplied by local groups,  Mr Smith said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"ExxonMobil will look to expand its $15 billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea after launching fresh studies to find new gas reserves.
The US oil major has already committed to building two processing units, or trains, to handle 6.6 million tonnes of LNG a year as part of a joint venture with Australian energy companies Santos and Oil Search.
 While Oil Search has already flagged its interest in doubling the size of the PNG LNG facility, ExxonMobil, as operator, will ultimately manage any expansion and also decide on which joint venture partners to bring on board for any future development.
 There is always interest in looking at expansion and those opportunities because to an extent you've got facilities built and you want to ensure they are full,  ExxonMobil's chairman John Dashwood told The Australian Financial Review.
 There is some seismic offshore exploration work happening [and] I think anything that made economic sense that would allow additional trains, just like at Gorgon, is very healthy. 
Oil Search managing director Peter Botten said he was confident of finding additional reserves to drive additional trains.
 My strong view is there's substantial further upside in the existing fields which, given appraisal and exploration success, I think there's a high likelihood there is enough gas to underwrite further trains. 
Mr Botten said gas for the potential expansion could be sourced from the venture's own drilling or third parties providing gas to the project.
 The easiest one to deliver is from the joint venture inside PNG LNG. If you look outside the venture there is lots of gas still to find but that is going to take a little while longer to come to market because of the necessity to prove up the gas and form a new joint venture. 
The gas project, which could double PNG's gross domestic product, will consist of gas extraction facilities in the country's Western Highlands, 450 kilometres of pipeline, and liquefaction facilities near Port Moresby.
ExxonMobil has a 33.2 per cent interest in PNG LNG, Oil Search holds a 29 per cent stake, and Adelaide-based Santos owns 13.5 per cent. Other shareholders include the PNG government and Japan's Nippon Oil Exploration.
In March, the partners confirmed a $US14 billion ($15 billion) financing deal, clearing the way for construction to accelerate.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"British gas giant BG Group is close to awarding a $1 billion pipeline installation contract on its $20 billion liquefied natural gas project, with Australian construction firm McConnell Dowell (a subsidiary of a South African-listed group) in pole position to win the deal.
Sources said BG might announce McConnell Dowell as preferred bidder as early as today after the Australian firm was thought to have edged ahead of Holland's Nacap as favourite to seal the deal.
 The pipeline contract covers the main 340-kilometre export line that will transport gas to Gladstone from BG's coal seam gas fields in the Surat Basin in southern Queensland.
Other contractors who bid for the deal included Italy's Saipem, France's Spie Capag and Australia's WDS in a joint venture with India's Punj Lloyd.
Chinese state-owned steel producer Baosteel won the manufacturing contract for the pipeline in March. BG had stated the pipeline was too large to be made by Australian steel mills.
The expected contract award is a further indication that BG's Queensland Curtis LNG project will be the first to sanction a final investment decision this year, ahead of rivals Santos and Origin Energy.
BG plans to deliver 8.5 million tonnes a year of LNG through two processing trains with first deliveries targeted for 2014.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Treasurer Wayne Swan has urged BHP Billiton to end its threats and consult with Labor over the proposed resource super profits tax as Fortescue Â­Metals added to the pressure by shelÂ­ving new projects worth $17 billion.
The tax has also made prospective customers of Santos's Gladstone LNG [liquefied natural gas] project in Queensland wary, the company's chief executive, David Knox, revealed.
 OZ Minerals chairman Neil Hamilton said his company would not be able to finish a feasibility study for a potential $300 million project at its Prominent Hill copper and gold mine in South Australia until more detail of the new tax was known.
Mr Swan said he was  pretty disÂ­appointed  by comments made by BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial Â­Review yesterday.
 It's a bit rich when the company goes public with these sorts of dire predictions when in fact they've yet to go to the [Treasury design consultation] committee,  he said.
Responding to the threat that projects such as BHP's Bowen Basin coalmine in Queensland and Olympic Dam in South Australia may not go ahead, Mr Swan said it was normal for the mining industry to put projects on hold for a variety of reasons. The Treasurer called on companies to come to the table rather than foment a  fear campaign  as the row between the government and the resources Â­industry about the new super profits tax continued.
Mr Kloppers warned that dividend payments to 540,000 shareholders could be hit by the government's proposed tax. He said Australia was in danger of tarnishing its reputation as a  gold standard  investment destination for mining companies.
BHP will have a meeting tomorrow with the Treasury Tax Committee and Rio Tinto will have its meeting today. A BHP spokeswoman said the company and the Minerals Council of Australia had raised problems with the resource tax proposal for months.
The government is holding discussions about the  transitional arrangements  including the impact of the super profits tax on existing projects, on company cash flow and the valuation of existing assets.
Before the talks between Rio Tinto Australia and Treasury, the company's managing director, David Peever, indicated the consultations appeared too narrow.
 The indications so far about the terms of reference for the [consultation] panel are not encouraging in the sense that all of what I would call the first-tier issues seem to be off the Â­table,  Mr Peever said.  But in any event, we'll be making our views known about those Â­issues. 
But Prime Minister Kevin Rudd indicated the government was open to quite broad negotiation with Â­comÂ­panies.  We'll negotiate on the detail, the implementation and the transitional arrangements for this tax,  Mr Rudd said.
South Australian Treasurer Kevin Foley appealed for a halt to the public feuding about the tax.  There is far too much heat in this argument,'' he said.
 We are clearly concerned by any decision to put on hold investment. 
The Rudd government also met with the Queensland government, which raised problems about the impact of the tax on the coal-seam gas industry. Fortescue Metals Group chief executive Andrew Forrest announced his company would suspend work on the $US9 billion ($10.57 billion) Solomon Hub project and the $US6 billion Western Hub project, in Western Australia's Pilbara region.
An internal review determined that the company's financing strategy for the projects would not be viable if the tax were implemented, Mr Forrest said. The company claimed the Solomon Hub project would have generated 20,000 direct jobs and the Western Hub could have generated as many as 10,000 jobs.
 I am a very experienced project financier, and I cannot see a way â€“ and my team and I believe we're the best project finance business in the country â€“ can't find a way that we can maintain our equity, our Australian equity, in these projects and still develop them under this highly theoretical new tax,  Mr Forrest said.
WA Premier Colin Barnett said a decision by Fortescue to put projects on hold would be detrimental to the Â­national economy.
 It's of great concern that every day we are seeing announcements like FMG [Fortescue] today saying that future projects are basically on hold,  Mr Barnett said.
Mr Swan said the 40 per cent tax on mining super profits was designed to replace royalties and to encourage Â­investment. On the Fortescue announcement, Mr Swan said it was not surprising that some projects would be put on hold from time to time for different reasons.
 We need to get a bit of perspective into these announcements, talking about putting some projects on hold,  he said.  Some of those projects may have been put on hold at other times for other reasons. 
Mr Swan, who was in Melbourne last night attending a dinner for outgoing BHP chairman Don Argus, blamed the prospect of the West Australian government's raising mining royalties in the state budget for creating uncertainty that might affect investment decisions.
One of Australia's leading petroleum companies has revealed the tax is hurting negotiations with customers in Asia. Talks under way between Santos and prospective customers for its Gladstone LNG project had been made tougher because of the tax, Â­Santos's Mr Knox said in Brisbane yesterday.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,2,"Woodside Petroleum Ltdchief executive Don Voelte says its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project would not have been viable had the government's proposed resources super profits tax been applied.
 We will tell you right now that management wouldn't have been able to take that project to the board of directors, it wouldn't fly under the new taxes,  Mr Voelte told reporters after a business lunch in Sydney on Friday.
  Pluto would still be in the ground. 
Mr Voelte said about 45 Woodside staff worked on economic models comparing the company's various projects under its current petroleum rent resources tax with what would happen under the proposed new tax on resource super profits.
The outcome of the study was that the Pluto project in Western Australia, which involves a $13 billion investment for phase 1, would not have proceeded.
The proposed tax has received an almost universally frosty response from mining companies.
Mr Voelte said that although Woodside would be hardly touched by the proposed tax, the poor reception to the proposal among offshore markets had  huge implications , particularly on how the company would be able to secure funds from overseas investors.
He said the company relied on foreign investors to provide funding for its projects.
 We have to be seen as a sovereign, risk-free country, in other words a very stable country,  Mr Voelte told an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia lunch.
 If this government starts to be seen as willy-nilly changing tax any time they want to on these things, this will be viewed very negatively by the investing world for Australia. 
On the broader economy, Mr Voelte said Australia was still  extremely fragile  coming out of the global financial crisis and blamed the proposed tax for the recent slide seen on local equity markets.
 To throw this on the Australian companies, it doesn't surprise me that the ASX is underperforming every other stock exchange in the world these days. 
Meanwhile, Mr Voelte described the company's relationship with East Timor government as  decent , but conceded the company was  struggling a little bit with the prime minister's office .
According to reports, officials from East Timor's independent national petroleum authority had recently refused to accept the development plan for a floating LNG platform, with a security guard throwing the documents into a car as two Woodside officials left the prime minister's office.
But Mr Voelte said the plans had since been lodged.
The decision to use a floating LNG plant, rather than pipe LNG back to Dili or Darwin, has been met with disappointment among some in East Timor.
Mr Voelte said under the requirements of the treaty signed by East Timor and Australia, the company was obligated to pick the best commercial option.
 The Timor option was a very expensive option and didn't provide the maximum amount of money to the governments of Timor Leste and Australia,  Mr Voelte said in response to a question.
Woodside closed down 21 cents at $41.38.
Mr Voelte also says that although the company is hardly affected by the proposed new resources tax, it still poses  huge implications  for Woodside.
Mr Voelte said the proposed tax has been viewed negatively in international markets.
 We have to be seen as a sovereign, risk-free country, in other words a very stable country,  Mr Voelte told the lunch.
Woodside had to borrow from offshore markets including places such as New York, Japan, Asia and China. He said constant tinkering with the tax system had not been received well offshore.
 The thing that bothers me probably the most on this is, this is the third time in three years that we have had a major change to tax,  Mr Voelte said.
 And, if this government starts to be seen as willy-nilly changing tax any time they want to on this thing, it is going to be viewed very negatively.
 We have to be a very solid place for these people to invest in.
 They have to have security of their investment in Australia. 
Mr Voelte added that China remains a  pretty good market  despite signs the giant Asian economy might be slowing.
 Our folks up there are telling us that we're still seeing pretty strong pricing,  Mr Voelte told reporters after speaking at a business lunch in Sydney on Friday.
Mr Voelte said the majority of Woodside's liquefied natural gas production went to Japan, with just one Chinese contract.
 Even with a small slowdown or a partial slowdown we're seeing a big desire in China to make sure that the provincial 400 million people that have been lifted up into middle class, they are demanding clean air,  Mr Voelte said.
 So we are seeing a lot of fuel switching going on.

We can only hope that the aquifers are not depleted of water or contaminated â€“ after all most rural towns and landowners in Queensland rely on this water for everyday use and that the Government and the gas companies can find something to do with the millions of tons of salt that they are bringing to the surface otherwise the whole saga will end up similar to the BHP oil spill off the American coastline with each company finger pointing at each other â€œNot my faultâ€?, â€œNot my faultâ€? and the Government will be in the background saying â€œWhoops, what has happened here â€“ not my faultâ€? and where will the Evironmental Protection Agency (EPA) be!!
Too late...
As one company said in their environmental impact statemente (EIS) â€“ only two per cent of Queenslanders live there â€“ but forgot to mention that the agricultural land here is some of the state's best.

Be our guestâ€¦.or you'll regret it!
Last night (Tuesday) was the opening night for Dalby State High's school musical and wasn't the show spectacular!?
Crowds of people, young and old, filled up the Dalby Great Hall to see the iconic story of Beauty and The Beast presented as a musical production.
As people arrived to the stain glass windows of the Great Hall entrance and collected their programs, the stage had already been set and you could feel the excitement in the air.
What would the sets be like? The costumes? The talent of the students?
The audience could only be impressed with the beautiful music played by the orchestra.
Then over the course of a few hours we were entertained by students who showed talent beyond their years.
The costumes and sets were second to none.
As a proud DSHS teacher I was so excited for the students.
Each character, whether the Beast or a napkin, was performed with style.
Cameron Ogden graced the audience with a beautiful Baritone voice pleasantly surprised many.
His acting from start to finish through anger and love was impressive while Lucy Smith played an excellent Belle, the â€œodd oneâ€? who wanted more than a provincial life.
Audiences laughed and cheered as other crowd favourites were seen in the macho, boisterous and egotistical Gaston played by Chris Allan and his side kick Lefou.
But who could forget the random operatic performances from the wardrobe, the kind-hearted words of wisdom from Mrs Potts or the cheeky French candelabra, Lumiere to name a few?
From start to finish the whole entire show was carried out beautifully.
It's a certainty that I will definitely be seeing it again before tomorrow night's last show as I'm sure will be quite a few people wanting to return.
Without a doubt ladies and gentleman right now there is simply nothing better to be doing tonight or tomorrow other than attending this local production of Beauty and the Beast.

GAB â€“ worth protecting for future
For many years the grazing industry has been replacing open bore drains with polythene pipe in order to stop the unsustainable use of the water from the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) and ensure the health of that most amazing clean water reservoir.
This action has had results with natural springs returning and watering points throughout our vast dry interior re-appearing.
But where is the logic?
Have we been saving this water so the coal seam gas industry can now pump it all out and deplete aquifers to never before seen lowest levels ever, only to put it in â€œevaporationâ€? ponds?
We are talking more water than the grazing industry would use in a thousand years â€¦ an amount equal to the quantity of Sydney Harbour on a yearly basis.
Not only are they leaving an environmental disaster waiting to happen on the surface but they have no idea of the consequences of their actions underground.

Conservatism equals hearts of stone
The cold black heart of conservatism will raise its ugly head when the Shadow Treasurer rises to his feet to deliver the velvet cloaked steel hand on a raft of policies to cut services to ordinary Australians.
We have already witnessed some of the thoughts behind the extremist thinking of the current crop of conservatives in the policy to send our children down into the West Australian mines.
This nation works best under responsible economic governance, which has guided us through the recent global financial crisis.
While I remain less than pleased with some of the recent mistakes from our first term government, I could not countenance the rich men's servants taking hold of the treasury benches again.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"ISUZU Trucks is going green with the release of four low-emission N and F Series trucks powered by compressed natural gas.
Isuzu Motors pioneered CNG vehicles in the early 1990s and currently commands about 70 per cent share of Japan's commercial CNG vehicle market. Sales to date exceed 10,000.
 The NLR 200 CNG, NPR 300 CNG, FSR 700 CNG and FSR 850 CNG models offer similar or better performance than their diesel counterparts.
However, exhaust emissions are reduced and harmful particulate matter emissions are zero.
Isuzu also claims its CNG range offers lower running costs due to more stable natural gas pricing and the ability to enter into a long-term contract with a local supplier for better balance sheet control.
Isuzu Australia product planning and engineering support manager Colin White says the new Isuzu CNG models have an excellent balance of power, refinement and environmental performance.
They also exceed EURO V and Japanese New Long Term 05 (J-NLT 05) environmental ratings required under ADR 80/03 legislation, not due for introduction until 2011, he says.
``These models even meet some performance criteria under proposed EURO VI standards, for which an introduction date is yet to be finalised for Australia,'' White says.
``Overall, the CNG engines provide greenhouse gas reductions in the order of 15 to 30 per cent - and these are conservative figures.''
The 4.5-tonne GVM NLR 200 CNG and seven-tonne GVM NPR 300 CNG share the naturally aspirated 4570cc, four-cylinder CNG 130 engine, which features multi-point injection to produce 96kW of power at 3200rpm and peak torque of 353Nm at a diesel-like 1400rpm.
Although the performance numbers are a little less when compared to a diesel engine of the same size, the CNG engine has a wider operating range, which allows lower gearing to compensate for the slightly lower torque.
Both models are fitted with Isuzu's AMT, the five-speed variant in the NLR 200 and the six-speed in the NPR 300.
They have two 150-litre steel CNG tanks with a range of more than 300km on a combined urban/highway cycle, loaded to full GVM.
The natural gas is stored at up to 200 bar in the high-pressure cylinders, which have safety lock-off valves and a pressure regulator system to supply fuel to the engine system at four bar.
Both models feature an idle-stop fuel-saving system, which turns the engine off at idle once the AMT selector has been placed in neutral and the park brake engaged.
Once the driver reselects drive, the engine automatically restarts.
The idle stop system can be engaged and disengaged via a dash-mounted button.
The N Series CNG models feature the same safety features and cabin appointments as their diesel-powered variants, such as pretensioning seatbelts, driver's SRS airbag, ABS and electronic brakeforce distribution.
The NPR 300 also comes with a standard passenger airbag.
They have double-acting hydraulic shock absorbers, while the NLR 200 features independent front coil suspension.
Other features are an adjustable driver's bucket seat, central locking, electric windows and mirrors, remote keyless entry and a 13cm touch-screen audiovisual unit and Bluetooth.
In the medium-duty market, Isuzu offers the FSR 700 and FSR 850 CNG models with GVM of 12 and 14 tonnes.
Both of these vehicles are powered by the CNG 220 engine, a 7790cc multi-point-injected, six-cylinder turbo-charged and intercooled unit producing 162kW of power at 2400rpm and 735Nm of torque at 1400rpm, which is more than the diesel equivalents.
The engine is mated to a six-speed MZW-6P manual transmission with air-assisted shift and synchromesh on gears 2-6.
The trucks are fitted with a single 150-litre carbon-fibre-wrapped aluminium tank, two 100-litre steel tanks and a 90-litre steel tank. Range is about 400km. They come with a driver's airbag, seatbelt pretensioners, ABS and hill start aid.
The trucks are covered by a three-year/100,000km/2000-hour warranty with optional extended warranties of up to six years or 300,000km.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Petroleum Ltdchief executive Don Voelte says its Pluto liquefied natural gas project would not have been viable had the Government's proposed resources super profits tax been applied.
``We will tell you right now that management wouldn't have been able to take that project to the board of directors, it wouldn't fly under the new taxes,'' Mr Voelte said in Sydney yesterday.
 ``Pluto would still be in the ground.''
Mr Voelte said about 45 Woodside staff worked on economic models comparing the company's various projects under its current petroleum rent resources tax with what would happen under the proposed new tax on resource super prfoits.
The outcome of the study was that the Pluto project in Western Australia, which involves a $13 billion investment for phase 1, would not have proceeded.
The proposed tax has received an almost universally frosty response from mining companies.
Mr Voelte said that although Woodside would be hardly touched by the proposed tax, the poor reception to the proposal among offshore markets had `huge implications', particularly on how the company would be able to secure funds from overseas investors.
He said the company relied on foreign investors to provide funding for its projects.
``We have to be seen as a sovereign, risk-free country, in other words a very stable country,'' Mr Voelte told an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia lunch.
``If this Government starts to be seen as willy-nilly changing tax any time they want to on these things, this will be viewed very negatively by the investing world for Australia . . . to throw this on the Australian companies, it doesn't surprise me that the ASX is underperforming every other stock exchange in the world these days.''
Woodside closed down 21 cents at $41.38.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,2,"ALAN KOHLER, PRESENTER: Well the list of big resources projects in doubt because of the 40 per cent resources rent tax lengthened this week with Santos warning its $8 billion coal seam gas plant in Queensland is now no certainty.
And on the other side of the country Fortescue Metals Group put on hold two big expansion projects in the Pilbara valued at around $17 billion.
 So while all the miners suffered again this week Fortescue had a really bad time as analyst after analyst issued research saying that it'll be the hardest hit by the tax because of its capital structure and the fact it's a relatively low cost producer.
On JP Morgan's figures, for example, the new tax would slash Fortescue's net present value by more than 20 per cent compared to the less than 10 per cent cut it modelled for the other big Pilbara tenants, BHP and Rio Tinto.
I spoke to Fortescue's chief Andrew Forrest in Perth.
Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's share price has been hit harder than everyone else's, why is that?
ANDREW FOREST, CEO FORTESCUE METALS GROUP: I think just the straight net present value fall which comes from this so called super profits tax.
Today Macquarie came out saying that they're downgrading our value in the Chichester project by 20 per cent and the Solomon project by nearly double that to 35 per cent.
So those severe downgrades of our value is the very reason why we knew that we couldn't continue our financing strategy with the Solomon project.
It's just the fact that we can't finance these projects now.
ALAN KOHLER: So what effect will the tax have on your earnings from existing projects?
ANDREW FOREST: Look, it's severe and I suppose for me whether or not I, you know, as a philanthropist give the shares away or pay it in tax, to my family it doesn't make a lot of difference but what really upsets me is that we are now unable to finance our future projects which those revenues were used for.
ALAN KOHLER: Well tell us about how the financiers, global financiers are now regarding your proposals and Australia in general as a result of the tax?
ANDREW FOREST: Look, they're fleeing Australia unfortunately, you can see that in the share prices of all Australian asset resource companies. You can see in the share price of those companies with offshore assets they're staying very stable.
If you look at those companies with Australian assets like ours, generating Australian jobs, generating Australian tax, generating Australian royalties for Australia we are the ones who are absolutely getting hammered.
ALAN KOHLER: What's your view about the timing of it? I mean do you think that the response from the mining industry and the market would have been as severe had there not been this panic going on in the markets?
ANDREW FOREST: I think actually you've seen other corrections in international markets where Australia's done very well. The resources sector saved us from a situation like Greece. It was the powerhouse which drove us through the global financial crisis.
It was that resources powerhouse which continued our ability to invest right throughout those down cycles. Now we don't have that ability to invest now, quite simply those revenues needed to support future projects are gone.
ALAN KOHLER: That's pretty extreme. Are you saying that there will now be no growth in Australia's resource industries?
ANDREW FOREST: I think it isn't me saying it. You can read it the Wall Street Journal, you can read nit the Financial Times, you can read it in Responsible Economist.
The very keystone which underpins this tax and justifies the word super profit above the risk free government bond rate is, of course, this so called 40 per cent tax guarantee where for if a project fails and there's been billions of dollars of failure, then the Australian mums and dads are going to write out cheque to that international company or that local company.
Now, the problem is that while the mums and dads of Australia will write out cheques to potentially now foreign owners, they won't see that benefit because Australian owners like me can't derive any value in that whole underpinning keystone to this tax.
ALAN KOHLER: The Government's actually said it's going to enter a consultation period now which could take as much as 18 months, what do you think of that?
ANDREW FOREST: Alan I need to ask you, has the Government said that the 40 per cent cannot be discuss and that anything above six per cent is a super profit and that can't be discussed either?
ALAN KOHLER: They've said the 40 per cent rate is non negotiable, I think.
ANDREW FOREST: They've also said to us the 6 per cent threshold is non negotiable as well. So the two underpinning factors to this tax, the 40 per cent cutting in before you pay interest, before you pay all your other taxes, before you pay off your capital to your bankers, that cuts in straight after 6 per cent which of course means you now can't project finance because the money you needed for your bankers, the money you needed to pay interest, that's gone to the tune of 40 per cent which means if you were someone borrowing money to buy a house, apply this same scale, your bank is going to say sorry, you're going to keep renting.
ALAN KOHLER: Is that what the banks are saying to you? Are they just shutting the door on you now?
ANDREW FOREST: Yes we've had a number of banks interested in the Solomon project, they've all pulled out. We've had a number of banks in the Chichester expansion, all but one's pulled out. The Macquarie analysis marking us down by 18 per cent and 35 per cent in the Solomon project, which was previously the world's most valuable undeveloped iron ore project, now that we can't finance that we can no longer guarantee those jobs.
There's some 20,000 jobs which are now placed in question all because we're relying on a piece of logic in a theoretical tax which simply does not work.
ALAN KOHLER: Yes, well a lot of economists, including Ross Garnaut, the chairman of Lihir Gold, say the resource rent tax is the right way to tax because these are non renewable resources that the community owns. What's your response to that?
ANDREW FOREST: I have a great affection for Ross, he's a terrific guy, but he knows himself, and I'm sure the Treasury Secretary knows himself, and it's not a question which I should ask or Ross should ask, this is a question the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd must ask, if there is no value in the underpinning reason to why you came up with this tax which is that 40 per cent tax credit, there's no value in that, doesn't the whole theory behind this tax collapse?
He's going to be told yes, it does. Now, Prime Minister, once you have that question answered take this tax off the table.
ALAN KOHLER: So what happens if they don't?
ANDREW FOREST: Well, you can see it in share prices now. You brought up Professor Garnaut, he's chairman of Lihir. Lihir's share price has done very well through the period. Those companies who don't have assets offshore like Professor Garnaut's, like my shareholders, my 55/60,000 Australian shareholders, their assets are here, they're caught and their assets are being hammered in value.
We got a note from the Chinese consulate only half an hour ago and it said Australia's competitive advantage to China over Brazil, over India, over all these massive competitors Australia competes against, that competitive advantage we did have is now gone.
So what happens now to our children? Our children when they grow up they must chase those careers in better industries than our resources sector overseas. Our kids can no longer chase the best jobs in the best industries here because someone introduced a tax on a totally false premise.
ALAN KOHLER: One thing you do agree with the Government about is the need to employ indigenous Australians and through your Generation One project you've set a target of employing or giving jobs to 50,000 indigenous people. Is that going to be tougher now with this tax?
ANDREW FOREST: Alan, you will forgive me, I hope, every question I've answered here I've been very open and honest about, whichever way I answer that question could hurt our indigenous brothers and sisters. I don't want to answer that but I can say, Alan, we are holding in our hands right now, as the Australian people, the end to the disparity.
It's the ability to wipe out this hideous imbalance which exists within the Australian people. We hold that now, it's called guaranteed employment.
Yes, there's a high class challenge to the government with guaranteed employment for the first time you need specific and proper training, you've got a reason to train for those guaranteed jobs.
That highlights another challenge. We've got to get our education right now to match that training and of course it eventually goes to where it must and that's the mums and dads of the Indigenous boys and girls to say get out of bed, go to school, we mightn't have had a choice, maybe welfare was our only choice but you kids, you have a choice.
You've got guaranteed jobs waiting for you, you've got education waiting for you, you've got training waiting for you, get out of bed, take those jobs.
ALAN KOHLER: Thanks for joining us Andrew Forrest.
ANDREW FOREST: Thank you very much, Alan.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"EASTERN PERTH, May 24 AAP - Eastern Star Gas Ltd (ESG) has sealed a deal with Japanese firms that paves the way for development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project using electric motor drives.
Shares in the coal seam gas explorer were up four cents, or 5.67 per cent, at 74.5 cents at 1205 AEST.
 ESG says it's signed a memorandum of understanding with a Hitachi Ltd division and Toyo Engineering Corporation for a feasibility study into using the Japanese firms' electric motor driven technology at an LNG export project at Newcastle in NSW.
 The mid-scale motor driven technology ... has a lower noise output and smaller footprint than other LNG technologies,  ESG managing director David Casey said in a statement on Monday.
 This makes it a natural fit for use at Newcastle, where noise minimisation, proximity to urban areas and compatibility with other port-side operations will be critical considerations.
 The modular nature of the mid-scale design means that construction costs and times are both about 20 per cent below what is required for other world-scale facilities. 
ESG chairman John Anderson said the first LNG exports were slated for 2014.
He said capital expenditure on gas production activities would exceed $1 billion over the life of the project.
A further $1 billion would be spent on construction of a first-stage, one million tonne per annum LNG plant, while pipeline infrastructure would cost about $500 million.

  No further commonwealth approvals are required for the first stage of the project,  chief executive Maurice Brand said in a statement on Tuesday.
 The company now expects its Gladstone LNG project to obtain final development approvals for onshore components in the coming weeks. 
The company said earlier this month that a fixed engineering, procurement and construction price for the first LNG processing  train , an LNG tank and associated site infrastructure totalled $US720 million ($A878.4 million).
Although the costs are higher than that estimated by the company in 2008/09, LNG Ltd says they're lower than for other LNG projects.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"FALLOUT from BP's disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout is messing with BHP Billiton's short-term production growth plans in the region. But BHP's petroleum division still forecasts overall group production will continue growing at an annual compound rate of 10 per cent for this year and next.
Planning for production growth to continue further out has also begun in earnest. BHP is to undertake its most active exploration program in 10 years, at a cost of $US800 million ($A960 million). It is also stepping up expenditure on pre-development work for the $US20 billion Scarborough/Thebe and the $US25 billion Browse liquefied natural gas projects offshore in Western Australia to $US2 billion annually.
 Before the BP disaster, BHP had been expecting oil production to grow from last year's 137.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to as much as 160 million boe in 2010 and more than 170 million boe in 2011, with growth from its new developments in the Gulf of Mexico a key factor. But the  significant uncertainty  prompted by the BP incident means it now expects growth to be at the lower end of its earlier expectations.
BHP Billiton petroleum division chief executive Mike Yeager said two of the drilling rigs that normally worked on the BP-operated Atlantis oilfield were now involved in BP's efforts to permanently fix the April 20 blowout of its Macondo well.  So there will be some uncertainty as to when they come back,  Mr Yeager said.  We're targeting, like BP says publicly, for that to be at least three months. It certainly could be longer. 
While there would not be a big impact on BHP's long-term production in the gulf, it could have a  big impact to our near-term story .
Mr Yeager said the BP oil blowout was  a catastrophic event  and the industry was  trying to support in any way we can to get it taken care of . The blowout destroyed the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, killed 11 workers and started one of the worst oil spills.
Mr Yeager revealed that US authorities had since cracked down on operations in the gulf.  We've had inspections of all of our drilling rigs and all of our offshore facilities, down to a level that we have never had before,  he said. BHP had conducted its own inspections, including testing emergency shutdown procedures in which  we double-check to make sure that every valve has worked .
 And we have had no issues with our facilities whatsoever,  Mr Yeager said. BP has previously denied there are safety concerns over the Atlantis joint venture in which BHP holds the 44 per cent non-operating interest.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"A deal with Japan may put NSW in the coal seam gas lead
ENERGY
 NSW could edge out Queensland in the race to export coal seam gas, with Eastern Star Gas joining Japan's Hitachi and Toyo to study the building of a $2.5 billion LNG operation at Newcastle port.
Eastern Star chairman and former deputy prime minister John Anderson flew to Japan late last week to sign a memorandum of understanding to study a million-tonnes-a-year LNG plant at Newcastle that could be completed by 2014.
Queensland's Gladstone port is the current focal point for the nation's CSG export ambitions, with four separate giant projects, costing up to $35bn each, planned by oil majors teamed up with local companies.
Those plants are due to start producing in 2014, if all goes to plan. But delays to approvals processes and the uncertainly of Kevin Rudd's 40 per cent resource tax mean that if Eastern Star can stick to its initial timetable it could export Australia's first liquefied coal seam gas. LNG Ltd has plans for a smaller plant that was to be in production in 2012, but it lost its gas supplier this year after Arrow Energy agreed to be taken over by Shell.
Eastern Star managing director David Casey said the company was pushing ahead with its LNG plans, despite the federal government's plans to tax resource profits at 40 per cent.
``It's not absolutely clear what the impact will be,'' Mr Casey said.
``The biggest challenge will be attracting offshore capital, should we choose to go down that path, until there is clarity around this tax.'' Emerging iron ore hopeful Mindax also said yesterday it was pushing ahead with its mine plans, despite the tax, after securing an $8 million deal with Singapore-listed Lion Group.
Managing director Greg Bromley said that when the deal was being finalised, which involved Lion Group taking a 10.3 per cent stake in the junior, the issue of the tax was discussed.
``We're still in an exploration phase and it is at least two years before production will come around and who knows what the situation will be then,'' he said.
``Discussions were quite open and they (Lion Group) had every opportunity to worry about that and they chose not to; they see it as part of the general risk profile.''
Eastern Star's LNG plant would cost about $1bn and a pipeline to the company's Narrabri coal seam gas project would cost about $500m.
The plant being looked at could be expanded to 4 million tonnes a year through the addition of 500,000-tonne-a-year production trains.
A million-tonne-a-year plant would result in between eight and 10 LNG cargoes a year leaving Newcastle.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Is Eastern Star Gas pulling an Arrow Energy?
Plenty of market observers thought Eastern Star's move to sign a heads of agreement with Hitachi and Toyo to develop a liquefied natural gas project at Newcastle was reminiscent of Arrow's plans for an LNG plant at Fisherman's Landing before the Shell-PetroChina takeover bid.
 Just as Shell had a 30 per cent stake in Arrow's LNG tenements, Santos holds 35 per cent of Eastern Star's ground (and has a 19.4 per cent position on the register). Santos notably was not a signatory to the Hitachi-Toyo agreement, even though it presumably had the option to do so. Instead, the theory is that Santos is more interested in pursuing its own plans for its share of the Eastern Star tenements, whether selling it into the domestic market or piping it up to Gladstone for its GLNG project. It is understandable for Eastern Star to be doing everything it can to commercialise its gas reserves in the Gunnedah Basin to create value.
But the deal to develop an LNG plant at Newcastle â€“ not yet binding â€“ could place pressure on Santos to decide whether to make a takeover bid for Eastern Star or risk losing control of the commercialisation plans for 65 per cent of that ground.
Royal Bank of Scotland reckons a takeover by Santos could be on the cards within six months as Eastern Star looks to finalise its contracts. Santos could use the proceeds of the sale of a stake in GLNG
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Coal seam gas junior Eastern Star Gas has set the ball rolling for a second liquefied natural gas export port on the eastern coast, signing up with Japanese heavyweights Hitachi and Toyo Engineering to study a $2.5 billion small-scale project at Newcastle.
The move has immediately put it at odds with Santos, its 19 per cent shareholder and exploration partner, which is not involved in the accord and is targeting sales into the local market or, potentially, a large-scale LNG project.
 Santos may even be driven to bid for control of Eastern Star to shore up its own gas reserves for its Gladstone LNG project in Queensland, some analysts suggested yesterday.
The Newcastle project, the first onshore LNG plan unveiled since the announcement of the federal government's resource super profits tax, would use coal seam gas from Eastern Star's licences in the Narrabri region and gas processing technology supplied by Hitachi and Toyo.
Production at an initial 1 million tonnes a year plant could start up in 2014, rivalling the timing of the first LNG shipments from Gladstone, the centre of eastern Australia's nascent gas export industry.
The link-up with the Japanese firms may help open doors for LNG sales talks, Eastern Star managing director David Casey told The Australian Financial Review â€Šyesterday.
Early discussions on offtake agreements have been made  more challenging  by the proposed new tax, but the RSPT  won't stop the project dead,  he said. Mr Casey said the venture faces hefty competition from larger, more advanced LNG projects around Australia.
Eastern Star aims to start initial engineering work on the project by year's end, depending on the study results, said Eastern Star chairman John Anderson, who signed the MOU with senior representatives of the two Japanese firms in Tokyo on Friday. Easter Star shares rose 2.5Â¢ to 73Â¢ on the news.
LNG export plans in NSW are far less advanced than in Queensland, where a clutch of rival ventures are planning projects in Gladstone to supply energy-hungry markets in north Asia and around the Pacific Basin. The most advanced of these are all large-scale projects. The leading small-scale venture, LNG Ltd's Fisherman's Landing project with Arrow Energy, fell by the wayside after Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina bid $3.45 billion for Arrow to capture reserves for their own project.
Santos may now find itself in a similar position to Shell, with RBS Morgans energy analyst Nik Burns suggesting the Adelaide firm may seek to pre-empt Eastern Star's plans by making a bid for the company. Santos would need to move within about six months to head off an agreement by Eastern Star to supply gas to ERM Power, he said.
Eastern Star has already confirmed the technical and commercial viability of exports from Newcastle and the partners will now examine the use at the site of the Hitachi/Toyo technology, which should cut construction costs and times by about 20 per cent compared with world-scale gas export projects, according to Mr Casey.
Costs are put at more than $1 billion on coal seam gas production, another $1 billion for the initial liquefaction plant and about $500 million for pipelines. Eastern Star has funds to finance project studies this year but would need to look at funding requirements for early work on the project into 2011 depending on development strategies and schedules, Mr Casey said.
Eastern Star has enough gas to supply the 50 petajoules a year needed for the initial plant, which would ship eight to 10 cargoes a year. The capacity could then rise incrementally to at least 4 million tonnes a year by adding production units of 500,000 tonnes, it said.
Hitachi and Toyo joined forces last October to enter the LNG business, targeting small, undeveloped gas fields mostly in Australia and Indonesia. They will use liquefaction technology from Chart Energy.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,2,"The doctor is in
NATURAL gas, including coal seam gas, is likely to become the energy source that bridges the gap from today's  dirty  fuels to cleaner ones of tomorrow.
 Since that is so, it is in the interests of Newcastle and the Hunter to stake a claim in the cleaner energy industries that may bring prosperity in the future.
As things stand, it appears that the Queensland port of Gladstone is poised to become the main gas export hub on Australia's east coast.
But opportunities may exist for Newcastle to carve out its own niche in this potentially important field.
Some analysts have suggested that corporate strategy may have played as big a role as market reality in this week's announcement of a study into a possible gas export terminal at Newcastle, implying that the plant may not be built.
That may be the case, but whether the Eastern Star/Hitachi project bears fruit or not, the idea of such a terminal should not be written off too readily.
A pipeline has already been planned to link the gas-rich coalfields of southern Queensland with the Hunter, picking up additional sources and markets en-route. That project, however, is stalled because of insufficient guaranteed demand. Failure by governments to commit to gas as the preferred fuel for new power stations in NSW is one factor that has undermined the pipeline's potential viability.
But the proposed pipeline route appears to pass close by the Narrabri field from which Eastern Star would draw its gas, creating a convergence of interest between the two projects and also the potential for shared capital risk.
Such a combination of projects should be of great interest to the NSW and Federal governments. Committing to gas as the preferred fuel for future power stations would create environmental benefits.
With its viability underpinned by demand from electricity generators, the new gas supply infrastructure would attract a wave of investment in developments - industrial, commercial and residential - that would more than justify government support.
The Hunter would have much to gain, economically, from these projects. The increased availability of relatively clean and low-cost gas in the region would be an impetus for other investments and the export terminal would be a welcome extra string to the Port of Newcastle's bow.

IT is good news that a new medical practice will open in Lambton, following the closure of the suburb's previous general practice clinic by its corporate owner in March.
Many patients who had been upset and inconvenienced by the closure will welcome the new Elder Street Practice.
It is to be hoped that bad blood between the doctors and their former employer, the Primary Health Care group, will subside and that patients will have fair and reasonable access to their medical records.
Resolution of this problem, however, should not stop governments acting to prevent such sudden practice closures in the future.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"The row between Woodside's Sunrise natural gas venture and the East Timor government has flared up more fiercely than ever, with the head of the tiny nation's oil and gas authority yesterday accusing Woodside chief executive Don Voelte of falsely claiming progress on the project approvals process.
Mr Voelte's assurances last Friday to a Sydney business luncheon that the venture had successfully lodged a field development plan with the East Timor authorities for a floating liquefied natural gas project at Sunrise  are inaccurate , Gualdino Da Silva, president of the National Petroleum Authority (ANP), told The Australian Financial Review.
 The regulator would not accept any development plan for Sunrise until the venture had provided in-depth studies for three options in total, including an onshore plant in East Timor, Mr Da Silva said. Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Osaka Gas have stakes in the venture.  We have told them: 'You have not done your homework well',  he said.
East Timor has long favoured developing the Sunrise field by piping the gas to a plant in East Timor for processing. This option has already been ruled out by the Sunrise partners as too risky and expensive.
The Sunrise field straddles waters administered by Australia and East Timor and, under a 2006 treaty, needs the approval of both governments to go ahead.
Mr Voelte last Friday insisted the joint venture expected to make a final investment decision on the Sunrise development by early 2012. He said the partners and the governments were required by the accord to develop the field  to best commercial advantage consistent with good oilfield practice .
Woodside yesterday declined to address the lodgement of the field development plan, but said it looked forward to  continuing engagement  with regulators over Sunrise.
Mr Voelte said Woodside had submitted three cost options for the field development plan to the East Timor government, including onshore East Timor, onshore Darwin and floating LNG. While all three were technically  available , the Timor option was  very expensive  and did not provide maximum returns to the governments, he said.
Floating LNG, in contrast, was  financially extremely strong , and provided $13 billion of revenue to each of the East Timor and Australian governments, more than the other two options.
 The difference for developing Timor was significant,  Mr Voelte said.  We believe and we have documentation that the Timor option was significantly more expensive than the floating LNG at start-up. Darwin was much closer to the floating price, but not as cheap. 
A source close to the Sunrise development said the East Timor onshore option would cost 40 per cent more than the floating alternative.
Mr Voelte has played down the ANP's account of two Woodside executives unsuccessfully trying to leave the development plan for the Sunrise floating project at the regulator's Dili offices on May 18. But Mr Da Silva yesterday held to the line that the officials refused to accept the documents, pushing them back into the departing car of Woodside's vice-president for Sunrise, Jon Ozturgut, and its East Timor country manager Brendan Augustin.
The ANP would only consider the submission of a single concept for the development of Sunrise once in-principle agreement has been reached by Australia, East Timor and the venture, Mr Da Silva said.
The partners hope eventually to produce 4 million tonnes of LNG a year from the floating project, which analysts estimate will cost $5 billion to develop.
KEY POINTS East Timor wants gas from Sunrise piped to land for processing. Woodside favours a floating plant as it offers the best returns.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"AUSTRALIA'S biggest working oil and gas project, the $27 billion North West Shelf, will fall under Kevin Rudd's 40 per cent resources tax, in a development its owners say will reduce its value and could cut the amount of liquefied natural gas it will produce.
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson's office yesterday confirmed the huge West Australian LNG project, which is exempt from the offshore petroleum resource rent tax, would be taxed under the proposed resource super-profits tax.
 While the North West Shelf already pays hefty royalties and excise taxes, part-owner BHP Billiton said the new regime would reduce the project's value.
Operator Woodside Petroleum said three trillion cubic feet of gas resources would be left in the ground if the new tax came in.
After his company met Treasury officials last week, Woodside boss Don Voelte said it was uncertain whether the project would fall under the RSPT.
But a spokeswoman for Mr Ferguson said yesterday the project, like all resource projects not under the PRRT, would fall under the new tax system.
Woodside said it continued to consult with the government over the tax regime for the North West Shelf, which it says falls under a more onerous tax regime than any other Australian resource project.
``The regime, which has been in place since the inception of the project, has resulted in royalty payments totalling $14bn,'' the spokeswoman said. ``We would be concerned if any change in the taxation regime reduced the value of this project to Woodside or damaged its competitiveness with other LNG projects.''
The North West Shelf works under a 12.5 per cent royalty regime and 30 per cent excise tax.
BHP, one of six North West Shelf owners, said it had been calculating the effect of the new tax.
``Moving from the current system to a resource rent tax system is not a huge movement . . . because it was already being hit pretty hard, but there is a loss of value on the North West Shelf,'' BHP oil and gas chief Michael Yeager said yesterday.
The operator of Australia's biggest resource project, the $43bn Gorgon project, which is under construction in Western Australia, says it is assessing the RSPT, to which it has the option of switching.
But at first glance there is no indication it is an appealing move.
``Long-term energy projects require massive investment and they also need fiscal stability throughout their economic life . . . and complex projects like Gorgon . . . cannot be achieved without the co-operation and partnership of governments, at the state and federal level,'' Chevron Australia managing director Roy Krzywosinski said.
While both the PRRT and the RSPT are 40 per cent taxes on profit, the RSPT kicks in at the long-term bond rate (about 6 per cent), while the PRRT is on profits higher than 5 per cent above the bond rate. [CORRECTION - A REPORT in The Australian yesterday (``Giant gas project to fall under new levy'', page 6) included the quote: ``The regime, which has been in place since the inception of the project, has resulted in royalty payments totalling $14bn. We would be concerned if any change in the taxation regime reduced the value of this project to Woodside or damaged its competitiveness with other LNG projects.'' In some editions, this was incorrectly attributed to a spokeswoman for Resources Minister Martin Ferguson. In fact, it was from a spokeswoman for Woodside. (The Australian, 27 May 2010)]

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"The Walgett Shire Council says it is disappointed it will not be able to use a proposed mining exploration site in a small western New South Wales town for bore water access once the miners have gone.
Cydonia Resources wants to start drilling within the grounds of the Carinda airstrip, north of Dubbo, to search for coal seam gas.
 Mayor Ian Woodcock says 22 staff are expected to work on the site, which will boost the local economy.
He says council asked if the site could be used for access to bore water, but was told it would not be possible.
Councillor Woodcock says the site will be filled in with concrete after exploration is completed.
 Council asked if it could be used for a bore for water supply. They don't actually go down - or they say they don't go down to the aquifers, down to the artesian basin,  he said.
 It would have been very handy if we could have said, 'well, you can do it and then we can take it over at a later date as a water supply for Carinda', but anyway, we can still talk to them about that just in case. 
Cr Woodcock says the council has been assured that there will be no damage to the airstrip.
He says the project will benefit the town.
 They'll be staying at Carinda and as much as they can do is going to be done locally. So that will be very good for a little place like Carinda,  he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"FINDING suitable people to build and operate LNG facilities planned for Gladstone has emerged as a key problem, but the challenge can be met according to Shaun McCambridge, a director of specialists Stellar Recruitment.
``From a recruitment perspective, LNG is an immature market compared to other parts of the resources sector, and the coal seam gas sector is especially young,'' he says. ``But there is a pool of people with transferable experience, especially people who have worked on North-West Shelf projects in Western Australia.
 ``A number are originally from the eastern states of Australia, and the development of the industry in Queensland can represent a chance to move back closer to home. The North-West Shelf is very isolated, and Gladstone can offer much better lifestyle choices, given its location.''
A campaign to recruit experienced people from overseas is also under way, with North America and Europe proving to be fertile territory.
The US, Canada and the UK have long experience with gas projects but the economies there are sluggish, so skilled workers are often open to the possibility of coming to Australia.
``Not long ago, CSG was seen as a problem for coal mining companies and it was drained and flared so that mining activity could take place,'' McCambridge notes. ``In fact, we have recruited some people from the coal sector who understand CSG, except now they are looking at it as a valuable asset. And there have been others with a conventional gas background who want to diversify their skills into CSG. It is seen as a big area for the future.''
Expertise in coal seam gas is a crucial issue for one of Stellar Recruitment's clients, WestSide, a company making the transition from explorer to producer of LNG at Gladstone, using CSG.
WestSide recently acquired 51 per cent of the Dawson Seamgas CSG assets in Queensland's Bowen Basin near Moura from Anglo American for $26.8 million.
``In the case of WestSide, our recruitment efforts have been mainly focused in Australia,'' McCambridge says.
``WestSide is a smaller company, compared to other major players in the field. There are many people who find that sort of environment attractive. There are a lot of career possibilities in a smaller, dynamic player, as well as the opportunity to have a real influence.''
Construction of the LNG facilities at Gladstone will involve both local labour and people employed on a fly-in/fly-out basis. When the project is operating, there will be a mix of permanently employed staff and FIFO contract workers.
``There are not many big infrastructure projects under way in Queensland at the moment, so civil engineers and contractors are more readily available for the construction phase,'' says McCambridge. ``But it is very competitive, with continuing demand from the new Western Australian projects like Gorgon, both for construction and operations people.
``There is also an LNG project operating in Papua New Guinea, which is using a lot of people from Queensland on a FIFO basis. Because of the stiff competition, there are some very big salary packages being offered, especially for people with proven expertise.''
The LNG industry is keenly aware of the need to invest in skills development for the long term, and most companies have internal training programs designed to build expertise in LNG and CSG. There have also been discussions with governments and academic institutions with the aim of developing qualifications designed for the LNG sector.
``This business is going to be around for a long time,'' McCambridge says. ``No-one wants to see the industry's growth constrained by a lack of good people.''

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"SANTOS SYDNEY, May 28 AAP - Santos Ltd, together with Malaysian partner PETRONAS, has received approval from the Queensland government to go ahead with the $7.7 billion Gladstone liquified natural gas project.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh announced the conditional approval on Friday after the Coordinator General Colin Jensen approved the project with strict conditions, following his review of the environmental impact statement.
 The project now needs federal government approval under its environmental laws, as well as other state environmental and production licences and safety approvals, Ms Bligh said.
 If all the necessary approvals are granted and the company confirms its final investment decision later this year the project could be shipping supplies from 2014,  she said.
The project involves Santos and PETRONAS extracting coal seam gas from the Bowen and Surat basins, and piping it 435km to a plant near Gladstone for liquefaction.
Initially 3 million to 4 million tonnes per annum will be exported, with the potential to increase that to 10 million tonnes.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"SANTOS PERTH, May 28 AAP - Santos Ltd has moved a step closer to proceeding with its $7.7 billion Gladstone liquified natural gas (GLNG) project in Queensland.
But Australia's largest domestic gas producer says it remains concerned about the potential impact of the federal government's proposed new resources tax.
 Shares in Santos were up 29 cents, or 2.36 per cent, to $12.56 at 1147 AEST.
The company said on Friday that the project, a joint venture with Malaysia's state-owned oil company PETRONAS, was Australia's first major coal seam gas-to-LNG project to receive environmental approval from the Queensland government.
However, LNG Ltd earlier this month moved closer to restarting construction of its $2.2 billion Fisherman's Landing LNG project, also at Gladstone, when it was was granted environmental approval for the three million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) project.
GLNG will initially export 3Mtpa to 4Mtpa, potentially increasing to 10Mtpa, starting 2014.
Santos president GLNG and Queensland Rick Wilkinson said in a statement on Friday that approval of the GLNG environmental impact statement by the Bligh government was a significant milestone as the joint venture moved towards a final decision to proceed with the project this year.
Queensland Coordinator General Colin Jensen approved the GLNG project with strict conditions after reviewing the environmental impact statement.
Mr Wilkinson said Santos was supportive of the conditions outlined by the coordinator general.
The project now needs federal government approval under its environmental laws, as well as other state environmental and production licences and safety approvals.
It will involve the development of coal seam gas resources in the Bowen and Surat Basins around Roma, and construction of a 435km pipeline to the Queensland coast.
It also involves construction of up to three processing  trains  at a liquefaction plant and export facility on Curtis Island, off Gladstone.
Mr Wilkinson said the coal seam gas-to-LNG industry promised billions of dollars of investment and the creation of thousands of jobs.
 GLNG will create about 5,000 construction jobs and 1,000 permanent operational jobs when the project commences shipments of LNG in 2014,  Santos said.
Santos chief executive David Knox last week said the Rudd government's resources super profits tax had made prospective customers of the GLNG project wary, according to media reports.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"Premier says exploration no threat
A DECISION to allow exploration for natural gas near the Twelve Apostles has been slammed as opening the door to large-scale drilling.
 Environment groups say state government approval for the search could damage the area's sensitive land and marine environment.
Energy company Origin has been given permission for the exploration, in the form of seismic testing, on land in the Bay of Islands Coastal Park, about 30 kilometres west of the iconic Apostles.
But Greens MP Greg Barber said that if the company wanted to explore the area, it wanted to drill.
 If ultimately what they are looking for is an off-shore drilling platform, it would be a 13th apostle,  he said.
Mr Barber said the Greens supported the use of natural gas as part of a move away from coal, but that section of the coast was too fragile and sensitive.
Consent for the exploration in the area west of Peterborough, which will not involve explosives or drilling, was tabled in Parliament yesterday.
The Victorian National Parks Association said parks were for people and nature and called on the government to commit to no mining or exploration in parks.
 What happens down the track if something is found? The land and the sea is sensitive, it's fragile geologically and ecologically,  the group's executive director Matt Ruchel said.
Environment Minister Gavin Jennings said he would not have signed the consent form without strict environmental controls.
Mr Jennings compared the level of surface vibration to standing on Spring Street when a city circle tram went past.
 This is 30 kilometres away from the Twelve Apostles. A tram goes past in Spring Street, nobody is going to feel it or hear it or respond to it in Werribee, which is about 30 kilometres away. 
If the testing went ahead, the minister said, it would be timed for between October and December, when whales were not in the area.
He said further development would not happen in the coastal park.
Premier John Brumby said the testing did not threaten the Twelve Apostles.
 There is no threat to them, there is no threat to sea life . . . it's a very basic form of exploratory survey,  he said.
The development has horrified the Friends of the Bay of Islands Coastal Park, who have vowed to fight the development.
Group secretary Richard Stevens said the approval came without warning, with local residents having no opportunity to raise their concerns.
 My initial reaction is one of horror,  he said.
 This is another case . . . of this government going ahead with local planning permits without local consultation, it is appalling.
 It has caught everyone by surprise,  Mr Stevens said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"ENERGY: A Queensland liquefied natural gas industry came a step closer yesterday when Santos received state government approval to build the first LNG plant there.
Four LNG plants are planned for Gladstone, but while Santos is the first company to get state approval, it has delayed by six months until the end of the year a final investment decision because of Canberra's resource super-profits tax.
 The $7.7 billion project still needs federal approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act, and a decision is expected this year.
The bigger obstacle is commercial.
The company had originally planned to make a final investment decision by the middle of this year, but Santos chief executive David Knox has said that the introduction of the super-profits tax meant the company was now hoping to make a final decision before the end of this year.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said yesterday the project would create 4800 construction jobs and 1200 permanent jobs, and there would be flow-on effects throughout communities in central and western Queensland.
``Given Queensland could host the first coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas industry in the world, the co-ordinator general has imposed strict conditions on this project to ensure its social and environmental impacts are reduced and sustainably managed,'' she said.
``For example the co-ordinator general will require Santos to contribute directly in substantial community infrastructure, such as accommodation and transport.
``This is the first liquefied natural gas project to get conditional approval, so it is important we get this right.''
Each LNG plant will cost up to $15 billion, and there is a belief in industry and government that not all four planned projects will go ahead.
Santos, as first mover, and the British-based BG Group, which took over Queensland Gas, are best placed to be the first two projects to proceed.
Santos chief executive David Knox told a Brisbane conference last week that the company remained open to negotiations with other producers.
Santos currently only has the customers to supply one production train, but the company has approval for three trains and the size to accommodate five.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Korea Gas, the world's biggest buyer of liquefied natural gas, has pointed to the Rudd government's resource super profits tax for hindering its participation in a multibillion-dollar project planned by Santos in Queensland.
 The biggest obstacle in the negotiation is the tax problem,  Korea Gas chief executive Choo Kang Soo told Bloomberg in Seoul yesterday.
  The proposed tax would definitely reduce profitability. 
Santos chief executive David Knox last week blamed the tax for hampering negotiations with prospective partners in Asia, which would buy LNG from its Gladstone LNG (GLNG) project and take equity in the venture. The main problem was in valuing the stake in the project that would be sold along with the gas, he said.
Santos and Malaysia's Petronas, which owns 40 per cent of the GLNG project,  remain concerned about the potential impact  of the tax, the Australian company said yesterday in a statement welcoming the granting of environmental approval from the Queensland government.
Despite GLNG being the first of the major LNG projects in Queensland to win state approval, a decision to go ahead with construction may still be several months away, partly because of the tax.
The Gladstone venture still has to complete engineering studies and find a second LNG buyer in addition to Petronas, which is both customer and equity owner in the project. So a final decision on the investment, estimated at about $16 billion for the first two production units, may still slip behind the go-ahead for a rival project by the United Kingdom's gas giant, BG Group.
Mr Knox confirmed last week that a final investment decision on the first 3.5 million tonnes-a-year production unit had slipped to the second half of the year from an earlier schedule of mid-2010. First exports are targeted for 2014.
The Queensland approval covers the drilling of 2650 wells over 25Â years in the Surat and Bowen Basins, a 435-kilometre pipeline from the coal seam gas fields to Gladstone, and a three-train plant on Curtis Island at Gladstone with a total capacity of 10 million tonnes a year. It also includes export jetty facilities and accommodation facilities.
The GLNG partners will also be required to co-operate with other LNG ventures on the pipeline route from Gladstone.
Environmental approval from the federal government is expected within the next couple of months.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"ONE of Australia's most distinguished doctors says he fears coal seam gas miners are ``tearing apart'' the social fabric of rural Queensland.
Jim Baker, a retired professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, accused gas explorers of setting neighbours against each other with secret deals over wells and property sales.
 He experienced the rural landholder's anguish first hand when a gas company told him they wanted to sink 32 wells on his showpiece Hereford cattle property, Lighthouse, near Roma.
``They try to tie you up with confidentially agreements,'' Dr Baker, 75, said. ``The destruction of rural camaraderie is the saddest part of all.''
He said some graziers had secretly sold up and others were conducting whispering campaigns about who got what.
But his neighbours were sticking together to resist moves by four gas companies.
He said Origin Energy held rights over his land, which is home to one of the country's top three Hereford herds properties and runs 11,000 premium breeders.
``About nine months ago they came and plonked down a map with 32 wells, pipelines and roads,'' he said.
``They also mentioned they wanted to build a huge pumping station and a (workers') camp for 300 men.
``And they wanted 100 acres (40ha) for a holding pond for their shitty salty water.
``I sat there like a stunned mullet. I was absolutely shattered. I could see the work of 35 years evaporating.
``I went in to the office and put my head in my hands and cried. I love this place.''
Dr Baker said a similar scenario was being played out on up to 10,000 rural properties in Queensland where miners have exploration and prospecting rights.
Dr Baker became one of Australia's highest profile medicos when in 1987 he left Brisbane and set up a flying obstetrics and gynaecology practice for rural Queensland, completing up to 1000 surgeries a year.
He and his wife Jill bought Lighthouse in the early 1970s and have lived there since 2001.
He said he and his neighbours feel the gas companies care little about the disruption to their businesses.
``I appreciate progress has to happen but some of us are being asked to pay a very high price for their progress,'' Dr Baker said.
``We believe they have a policy of divide and conquer.''
He said he was sure miners and the State Government had no understanding of the collective impact mining will have on the Great Artesian Basin.
``Coal seam gas extraction is a giant, uncontrolled experiment ,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"SANTOS'S proposed multibillion-dollar project at Curtis Island to convert coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas yesterday jumped an important hurdle.
But the company said it remained worried about the proposed resources super profits tax.
 State Government approval of the project's environmental impact statement keeps Santos and its partner, Malaysia's Petronas, on schedule to make a final investment decision on the project, whose initial stage is estimated to cost $7.7 billion, by year's end.
Yesterday's approval was hardly surprising given the State Government's hopes that CSG-to-LNG will be the new boom industry over the next two decades.
The approval was qualified to an extent, which will no doubt be noted by the three rival proposals slated for Curtis Island in Gladstone harbour.
Queensland Co-ordinator General Colin Jensen said he needed more information on the project's impacts, particularly of the 55,000 tonnes of salt and additional water that will be produced to allow the CSG for the project to flow.
But the Government didn't seem much worried by that. Premier Anna Bligh said the approval was great news for Queensland.

Coal seam gas plans approved
Mr Jensen's 314-page report found the proposed concentrations of contaminants in the coal seam gas water Santos would produce exceeded the acceptable limits that would allow its easy beneficial use.
``The new industry has thrown up several challenges including the management of coal seam gas water as well as pipeline access across the World Heritage-listed coastal wetlands and marine environments around The Narrows at Gladstone,'' Mr Jensen said.
``My conditions are clear and will not allow salt from coal seam gas water to leach into the environment.''
Santos will also have to contribute millions of dollars directly in substantial community infrastructure, such as accommodation and transport.
The joint venture, which is known as Gladstone LNG, said the conditional approval was a significant milestone.
GLNG president Rick Wilkinson said the project would work with the Government and the communities involved to deliver an outcome which would provide jobs, regional development and export income.
The big project also requires a Federal Government tick to its environmental impact statement.
But Mr Wilkinson said: ``As our EIS outlined, we are committed to implementing comprehensive environmental management plans and are supportive of the conditions outlined by the (Queensland) Co-ordinator General.''
He said the development would create about 5000 construction jobs and 1000 permanent operational jobs if and when it started shipping LNG, which is scheduled for 2014.
Mr Wilkinson also emphasised Santos was concerned about the potential impact of the Federal Government's proposed resources tax.

What it'll involve is everyone in the industry who is unhappy with the way the Government is treating the transport industry to tie a red ribbon on their vehicle, mainly on their mirrors, to show their discontent, and from there on, positive action will be taken in incremental periods after that,'' Mr Pattel told ABC radio. We're encouraging everybody to become involved in it, not just the trucking industry, but the farmers, the graziers, the manufacturers, the lot.''
Actros best of decade
THE 2009 Mercedes Benz Actros has been voted the truck of the decade by British magazine Truck and Driver. Readers were asked to choose from the 10 trucks of the year during the decade. Competitors included the 2000 MAN TGA, the 2001 Iveco Stralis, the 2002 Mercedes Actros, the 2003 Scania R-Series, the 2004 MAN TGL, the 2005 Daf XF105, the 2006 MAN TGS/TGX, the 2009 Mercedes Actros and the 2010 Scania R-Series.
Since entering the market in 1996, about 650,000 Actros models have been sold.
EU to limit speed
VAN and light truck drivers could be forced to run speed-limiters if a European Union proposal is adopted.
Reuters made public a leaked report showing the EU is considering the proposal in a bid to reduce emissions.
The report suggests fitting mandatory speed controllers to vans and light trucks, which would stop vehicles surpassing 120km/h, would be a cost effective way of cutting emissions.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"The Queensland Government says conditional approval of the $7.7 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will be a significant boost to the state's central region.
Minister for Infrastructure and Planning Stirling Hinchliffe says the project will be the first of its kind in Queensland and also the first in Australia to convert coal-seam gas to LNG.
 He says the new industry will create a huge number of jobs for the region.
 This project alone could generate 4,800 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs in Gladstone and Roma, with flow-on effects for the whole of the central Queensland community and indeed the south-west,  he said.
Gladstone Mayor George Creed says conditions regarding infrastructure funding imposed by the coordinator-general are vital for the future of the region.
 It's also absolutely necessary - you can't expect our current residents and ratepayers to foot the bill to provide infrastructure for future development so that's entirely appropriate,  he said.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"EAST Timor's Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao has signalled his country is prepared to forgo billions of dollars from the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea.
Stepping up pressure on Australian company Woodside over its plans to develop a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the fields, Mr Gusmao said  many developing countries fall victim to the corporate resource giants exploiting and plundering their sovereign resources .
  Timor-Leste (East Timor) will be the country that goes down in history as the nation to put a stop to it,  Mr Gusmao told The Age.
He also criticised Woodside for appointing former Australian diplomat Brendan Augustin as its in-country manager in East Timor. Mr Gusmao has repeatedly referred in the past week to Woodside's failed $1 billion operation in the impoverished north-west African country of Mauritania â€” which was fronted by Mr Augustin while on unpaid leave from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That operation collapsed amid alleged corruption, shady deals and a coup. Mr Augustin is not accused of any wrongdoing.
But his appointment raised questions about the relationship between the department and Woodside.
A Woodside spokesman said the company was  deeply disappointed at the personal attack .
Mr Augustin and another Woodside executive staged a walk-out in Dili at the National Petroleum Authority, the independent industry regulator, on May 18. The authority had refused to accept Woodside's draft plan for a floating platform, insisting it must also submit plans for pipelines to both Darwin and East Timor.
Woodside claims its draft development plan has been lodged; the authority insists it has not.
Timorese leaders will today intensify their campaign for the gas to be piped to a processing plant in East Timor as they release a statement accusing Woodside and its partners of pressing for a floating plant so that it can develop new technology. The floating platform would be one of the world's first.
Mr Gusmao, a former guerilla fighter, said his country would not pay for unproven technology proposed by Woodside to benefit overseas companies and shareholders.
 Here in Timor-Leste we struggled long and hard for our independence, here our soil carries the blood of those who fought for our freedom, so we respect our laws, our sovereignty and our democratic institutions,  he said.
Mr Gusmao said that unless there was an advantage that lifted the Timorese from poverty,  then we will wait until many generations have learnt the lesson that humanity comes before commercial realities.  We will be the nation that others follow . . . oil giants will be forced to change their indecent behaviour. 
A Woodside spokesman said yesterday:  As the Greater Sunrise fields lie 80 per cent in Australian waters and 20 per cent in joint waters, Woodside is committed to working closely with governments of both countries to develop these fields.

SOURCE: BLOOMBERG, MERRILL LYNCH

 Investors expect more profit warnings in the lead-up to the end of the financial year as companies reassess earnings guidance in light of higher interest rates and the waning of the federal government's fiscal stimulus.
Discount airline Virgin Blue joined the chorus of companies confessing earnings would fall short of expectations with a massive profit downgrade on Friday.
A drop in leisure travel underscored concerns about companies whose earnings were exposed to weaker consumer confidence.
Retailers have been prominent in the confession season, announcing cuts to sales and earnings guidance, while health-care, mining services and industrial companies have also pared back expectations.
The flurry of warnings comes as investors have been rattled by sharp falls across global sharemarkets, fuelled by concerns over Europe's continuing debt woes and fears the Â­region's problems may undermine the global recovery.
Weaker retail sales and consumer confidence have focused attention on the Reserve Bank of AustÂ­ralia's June board meeting tomorrow, at which economists expect the bank to hold interest rates steady at 4.5 per cent.
Analysts had upgraded earnings estimates over the past year as the economy recovered and sharemarket rallied, but there has been a recent rise in the number of companies warning that earnings will fall short of shareholder expectations.
 It's usually the same culprits time and time again and this year won't be any different,  said Perpetual Investment Management's head of Australian equities, John Sevior.
 When compared with a year ago, retailers aren't doing well. But they were artificially boosted back then, yet people are still shocked at how bad they are doing.''
Consumers have reined in spending amid higher interest rates and as the one-off boost from the Rudd government's stimulus cheques, handed out during the height of the financial crisis, have faded.
Retail sales growth is at a nine-year low, in a sign that although consumers are spending on new homes and cars, they remain cautious about buying household goods.
 One of the repeating themes of recent corporate newsflow is that stimulus policies set an artificial base for domestic demand, notably in retail and housing activity,'' JPMorgan equity strategist Paul Brunker said.
However, some analysts believe the downgrade risk may be over for the retail sector, despite the challenges posed by the lack of fiscal stimulus spending and rising interest rates.
So far only one retailer, Fantastic Holdings, has downgraded profit guidance for 2010.
Myer and Woolworths have downgraded their sales guidance for the year but are adamant they will achieve their profit targets, while Kathmandu has confirmed it will achieve its prospectus forecasts.
 I think you've seen all the downgrades you're going to see before reporting season,  said Macquarie Equities small cap analyst Alistair Munroe.
 They have all brought out their bad news and aired their dirty laundry, and any ones that haven't say: We are doing okay.'
 We don't expect anyone to come out with anything significant between now and reporting season. 
Small cap retailers tend to be cautious â€“ under-promising and over-delivering â€“ and some may even deliver positive earnings surprise, he says.
 It's possible the small cap guys have been a little conservative with what they've been forecasting and they may hit their mark or maybe surprise a tiny bit,  Mr Munroe said.
Other companies to warn that revenues or earnings will be lower include Hastie Group, Spotless, Leighton Holdings and Skilled Group.
Virgin Blue stunned the market on Friday after saying falling leisure travel and intense competition would cut its full-year profit to between $20 million and $40 million, compared with its earlier guidance of $80 million.
Some experts are concerned about the impact on earnings from the recent slump in the Australian dollar. Over the past six weeks, the $A has slumped from US93.90Â¢ to as low as US80.67Â¢.
Foster's Group has blamed a strong Australian dollar and a higher discount rate applied to the valuation of its wineries for the need to make a non-cash impairment charge of between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion.
Currency fluctuations will be a theme of the half-year results for construction and building materials companies, after Leighton Holdings and James Hardie took a hit from a strong Australian dollar in late 2009 and early 2010 when the $A rose from around US88Â¢ to US93Â¢.
Leighton slashed its 2010 revenue forecast at its nine-month results in May, forecasting sales of $18.5 billion, down $500 million on its December outlook.
Most of Leighton's mining and overseas construction contracts are in US dollars, or in currencies pegged to the US dollar. Around one-fifth of its total revenue comes from overseas.
James Hardie reported a net loss for the 2010 financial year after the strong Australian dollar raised the cost of its asbestos liabilities, which are reported in US dollars.
In contrast, Boral's result on August 18 could be hit by the recent weakness in the Australian dollar against the US dollar.
Boral is America's largest brick manufacturer and some 90 per cent of its debt is denominated in US dollars. Credit Suisse forecasts a lower Australian dollar will create an additional $100 million of debt for the construction group. Boral has already warned that achieving guidance of net profits after tax of around $124 million would require roughly consistent exchange rates.
The deteriorating outlook for the domestic pathology sector has battered healthcare stocks in recent weeks, after earnings downgrades from Primary Health Care and Sonic Healthcare flagged the crippling impact of government funding cuts on the industry.
The entire industry has been under pressure as Healthscope, Primary and Sonic have tried to recover revenue lostdue to the government's decision to cut $763 million from pathology funding over four years.
Pharmacy wholesalers Australian Pharmaceutical Industries and Sigma Pharmaceuticals are also expected to tread cautiously ahead of their results, following the federal government's decision to strip $2.5 billion from the pharmaceutical industry over five years, announced in this month's budget. Sigma announced a $424 million goodwill impairment charge in March and a $389 million full-year loss.
There is not expected to be a lot of movement in the utilities sector this season, although AGL Energy could upgrade its earnings due to higher retail energy prices and its Project Phoenix overhaul of the information technology systems and processes.
 Consensus already sits above the top end of their earnings guidance,  one analyst said.
A company spokesman said there was no change to any guidance.
AGL has previously said it will make an underlying full-year net profit after tax of between $390 million and $420 million.
AGL first gave that guidance last October at the company's annual general meeting, and reaffirmed it at the interim results in February.
Among the regulated utilities, analysts are not expecting any earnings surprises.
 We'd expect the results to be relatively uneventful from a [profit and loss] perspective,  said Austock Securities infraÂ­structure analyst Andrew Chambers.
However, a challenge for regulated utilities stocks is the requirement to fund increases in capital expenditure when they pay a large amount of their operating cash flow to shareholders.
Increased capital spending requirements put distributions from the companies at risk. For instance, last year electricity and gas distributor SP AusNet opted to raise capital and cut distributions in order to fund spending.
Last year, Spark Infrastructure cut distributions but didn't raise any capital. The company is now undergoing a strategic review and is expected to issue an update when it unveils full year earnings in August.
Spark is thinking of changing its corporate and capital structures, which could involve selling some or all or its assets, raising equity, or taking the company private.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Argument continues over the practicality of Woodside's plans for a major new LNG plant, writes Angela Macdonald-Smith.
Woodside Petroleum is coming under renewed pressure over the development of its $30Â billion Browse liquefied natural gas project, with venture partners cautioning that it may struggle to be economically viable.
 The warnings voiced most recently by BHP Billiton's petroleum chief Michael Yeager last week come as the minority partners step up work on their own multi-billion dollar LNG projects off the north-west coast of Western Australia, signalling the Woodside-run Browse venture may take a back seat to those rival plans.
BHP last week revived its $US20Â billion ($24Â billion) Scarborough LNG venture with Exxon Mobil as a strong candidate for development, while Chevron has made rapid progress at its Wheatstone project and Royal Dutch Shell is pushing ahead with its floating LNG plans at Prelude and, on the eastern coast, its coal seam gas-based venture with PetroChina.
The open dissent voiced by BHP and others comes five months after the partners were forced by government intervention to either back Woodside's preferred option of building a new plant on the undeveloped Kimberley coast or risk losing their leases over the vast offshore gas fields.
Several of them had favoured a slower, less costly option of processing the gas at the existing North West Shelf venture down the coast once existing gas supplies for the venture run down.
The partners, which also include BP, are now locked into a $US1.25Â billion work program intended to bring a final investment decision in mid-2012. But BHP, Chevron and Shell have not dropped their opposition to the plan to build the project on the James Price Point site, about 60km north of Broome.
Mr Yeager last week listed a string of technical hurdles yet to be overcome by the Browse venture, which aims to develop about 14Â trillion cubic feet of gas held in three complex offshore fields some 250 km from shore. The size and length of the pipeline to the coast, the softness of the seabed and the carbon dioxide content of the gas all present  enormous  challenges, he said.
 We'll have to see if we can get all these technical issues and still have a viable project as it moves forward there,  Mr Yeager said. BHP has not even begun marketing its 8.3Â per cent share of Browse LNG as the project is at too early a stage to nail down the schedule, Mr Yeager said, suggesting a final investment decision may not be reached for up to three years. That is well beyond Woodside's â€“ and the government's â€“ targeted time-line.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte assessed the prospects for Browse LNG much more bullishly in a recent speech in Sydney, when he underlined his determination to reach a final investment decision on the project in 2012.
 There should be no need for this gas to remain in the ground any longer,  Mr Voelte said.
Mr Yeager clearly indicated last week that while BHP is  complying right now with the Kimberley notion,  the company believes it is being prematurely being forced into the James Price Point option.
 At the end of the day, the idea of building brand new, greenfield Kimberley infrastructure and having, right down the road from it, North West Shelf infrastructure that may or may not be full, is the real dilemma,  he said.
Shell's new executive vice-president, Upstream Australia, Ann Pickard, has also cast doubts on the Kimberley plan but said she was waiting for Woodside to come back to the partners later this year after completing forecasts on the project economics.
But for the government to have taken this stricter tack with its  use it or lose it  policy on offshore leases over discovered fields is in any case not appropriate for natural gas, given the long-term nature of projects and much higher investments, Ms Pickard said.
Chevron Australia head Roy Krzywosinski has also been less than enthusiastic about James Price Point and the string of milestones reported by its majority-owned Wheatstone LNG venture, coming on top of last year's go-ahead for the $43Â billion Gorgon project, indicates where the US company is focusing its efforts.
Wheatstone, bolstered by last December's $90Â billion LNG sales accord with Tokyo Electric Power, is on track for a final investment decision in the second half of 2011, while Shell is targeting early next year for a final go-ahead for its floating project at Prelude.
BHP last week revealed a target of the 2011 financial year to start initial engineering on the Scarborough project, with a decision on how to develop the field, together with the nearby 100Â per cent-held Thebe deposit, likely in six to nine months. All four potential options are  attractive and economic,  said Mr Yeager, pointing to the possibility of a standalone onshore or offshore plant, or of processing the about 10Â trillion cubic feet of gas resources at either Chevron's Wheatstone or Woodside's Pluto project.

 WestSide and Mitsui in March announced they would jointly acquire the Dawson CSG fields west of Gladstone.
The parties also said at the time that Mitsui would have the option, until October 31, to acquire 49 per cent of WestSide's existing interests in the neighbouring Paranui prospect and its new Galilee Basin tenements.

The coal-seam gas exploration program is operated in a joint venture with Santos.
 Under the phase 2 program, which began at the weekend, the drilling will focus on the Murrurundi Trough in the area of Petroleum Exploration Licence 456.
Apollo managing director Andrew Mayo says drilling to a target depth of one kilometre will take place over the next 12 months at the site, 25 kilometres south-west of Murrurundi.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"Local groups have expressed their concern and outrage at Queensland's co-ordinator-general Colin Jensen giving Santos' Gladstone-based Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) project conditional approval, despite admitting he has serious reservations about the company's ability to deal with the water by-product.
Mr Jensen's report released late last week said: â€œThe associated water management proposed to date has the potential to result in widespread, irreversible and serious environmental harm, and cause long-term problems for soils, waters, vegetation, ecosystems, crops and future land useâ€?.
 â€œIt is clear that the extensive use of high salinity water, which is proposed in the associated water management strategy in respect of â€˜amended' water, does not meet the â€˜general approval' standards by reference to DERM beneficial use guidelines.â€?
Chair of the Basin Sustainability Alliance said the Alliance was very, very disappointed with the coordinator-general's decision.
â€œWe can not believe that approval has been granted because there's just so many unknowns ...we're very concerned that there are just so many questions about this industry and no one seems to have any answers,â€? Mr Hayllor said yesterday.
Environmental campaigner Drew Hutton said this was a typical sell-out by the government and that it was decisions like this which necessitated environmentalists and farmers calling for a moratorium.
Mr Jensen's conditional approval for the project comes hot on the heels of the National Water Commission (NWC) calling for mining activities to come into line with water access and planning framework that is compliant with the National Water Initiative.
Ken Matthews, NWC's commissioner, released a report and position statement on Friday saying that the commission believes â€œmining activities should operate under the same rules as other water usersâ€?.
Mr Matthews said this would allow for optimum management of water at all levels of government and that the mining industry actually stood to benefit from this as it would ensure secure access to water and open up the path to trade water with other users.
When the National Water Initiative was signed in 2004, there was an allowance for special circumstances for the mining and petroleum industries, but Mr Matthews said â€œlittle progress has been made since to spell out those special circumstancesâ€?.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Petroleum has rejected claims that it failed to provide East Timor with justification for its decision not to develop the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea through a liquefied natural gas plant in the fledgling nation.
East Timor has reacted angrily to the decision, declaring the Perth oil and gas company had not done enough work to justify jettisoning the concept of an East Timor LNG plant.
 Last month, Woodside confirmed it had also rejected a Darwin LNG plant, in favour of a floating LNG plant.
It is understood Woodside has tried to deliver documents to East Timor's National Petroleum Authority with analysis showing floating LNG was the cheapest option and an East Timor plant the most expensive.
According to the documents' cover letter, dated May 18, the presentation contained ``A comprehensive analysis of the economic outcomes for each of the downstream development options and the establishment of an integrated development schedule indicating first gas in 2017''.
Whether the East Timor government has seen the report is another matter.
After meeting Woodside executives Jon Ozturgut and Brendan Augustin, Petroleum authority president Gualdino da Silva refused to accept the documents, throwing them into the Woodside pair's car as they left.
Mr da Silva has reportedly said the two executives left the meeting without shaking hands or saying goodbye after he had told them he could not accept the documents.
But a Woodside spokesman said the meeting was cordial and denied the pair had walked out.
It is understood email versions of the documents could have made their way to East Timorese officials.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee estimates Woodside and its partners, Shell and ConocoPhillips, will need $US11 billion ($12.9bn) to develop the fields through a floating LNG plant.
He puts the chance of the project going ahead at 30 per cent.
Woodside has told East Timor the project would deliver $US13bn of revenue to the country over the project's life.
A Woodside spokesman said yesterday that international treaties between Australia and East Timor, which each own half the project's gas resources, meant the fields needed to be developed to the best commercial advantage, and that a plan to do so had been submitted to regulators in both nations.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,2,"ITALIAN giant, Eni is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, operating in oil and natural gas, refining and marketing, power generation, petrochemicals, engineering and construction. As part of its growth strategy for the South East Asian region, Eni began acquiring assets in Australia in 2000. The company has offices in both Perth and Darwin. In Australia, Eni operates the Woollybutt oil field (eni 65 per cent interest) offshore the Carnarvon Basin, and the Blacktip Project, supplying gas to the Northern Territory Power Water Corporation. In the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) between Timor-Leste and Australia, eni has a 10.99 per cent interest in both the Bayu-Undan Gas Condensate Project and the Darwin LNG Company, which liquefies the gas piped from Bayu-Undan. In 2007, Eni took a 40 per cent interest in, and became operator of, the JPDA PSC area 06-105, and in 2008, discovered the Kitan oil field.
  In 2009, the Field Development Plan was submitted to the regulator of the JPDA, the Timor-Leste National Petroleum Authority (ANP), which was approved in April 2010, enabling the commencement of the project. Production is due to commence in the second half 2011. Exploration: Eni holds interests in 19 exploration permits in Australian and JPDA waters, 10 of these as operator with interests ranging from 18.66 per cent to 100 per cent, covering an area of about 42,056.74 square kilometres. Production: Woollybutt & Woollybutt South: Eni is operator of the Woollybutt oil field with a 65 per cent interest. Woollybutt is located in the WA-25-L Production Licence in the Carnarvon Basin and contains two separate lobes. In May 2008, Eni commenced production from the Woollybutt south field via subsea tie back to the FPSO Four Vanguard. During 2009, the FPSO underwent planned maintenance and equipment refit at dry dock. The newly refurbished FPSO, renamed Four Rainbow, arrived back to the field and re- commenced production in early March 2010. The Woollybutt oil fields have produced a total of about 32 million barrels to date and is expected to produce about 38 million barrels. The Bayu-Undan Integrated Project: The Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is located in shallow waters, about 500 kilometres north west of Darwin, within the Timor Sea, Joint Petroleum Development Area. Eni holds a 10.99 per cent interest, with ConocoPhillips as operator. Discovered in 1995, the field has been developed in two phases:
The offshore construction for Phase I started in May 2002 and was completed in 2004. The first production commenced in 2004 and comprised the production of condensates (light oil or hydrocarbon liquids), propane and butane, and a gas recycle project. This involved bringing the whole well stream to the surface, the removal of condensates, propane and butane (for export) and then the re-injection of the dry gas back into the reservoir. This production process was necessary to provide time for Phase II of the project to be constructed and become ready to receive the gas stream. Development of drilling started in 2002 and ended in 2005; Phase II of the development involved the installation of a natural gas pipeline of about 500 kilometres in length from the Bayu-Undan gas field to Darwin, and the construction of an LNG facility located at Wickham Point, Darwin. Construction of the LNG facility and the associated natural gas pipeline from the Bayu-Undan field was completed in 2005 and the first LNG cargo was delivered in February 2006. Darwin LNG meets gross contract sales of up to three million tons of LNG per year to customers in Japan. The Blacktip Project : Eni has a 100 per cent interest in permits WA 279-P and WA 313-P in the Bonaparte Offshore Basin off the northwestern coast of Australia where the Blacktip and Penguin fields are located. The Blacktip gas field is located at a water depth of about 50 metres. The project consists of the drilling of two initial development wells, the installation of a production platform, the laying of an offshore pipeline of about 110 kilometres and the construction of an onshore gas processing facility located at Yelcherr, near Wadeye, in the Northern Territory, with a capacity of 44 petajoules. In 2006, Eni signed a Gas Sale Agreement with the Northern Territory Power and Water Corporation to meet a demand of 23 PJ/a per annum, starting in 2009 and increasing to 37 PJ/a, for a total quantity of nearly 750 petajoules over a period of 25 years, with room for growth. Construction of the Onshore Gas Plant (OGP) commenced in October 2006 and fabrication of the Well Head Platform started in February 2007 at Henderson in Western Australia. Production from Blacktip started in September 2009 and by the end of the year the project was in producing and supplying gas to meet the NT Power and Water Corporation demand. Development: The Kitan Project: The development concept involves three initial sub sea production wells tied back to a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading Vessel (FPSO), located near the
field. At end 2009, all major contracts for the project were either awarded or well advanced. First production from the Kitan field is expected to commence in the second half of 2011. Such an achievement would see oil being delivered to market about about three-and- a-half years from commercial declaration discovery. In a further strengthening of Eni's position in the Timor Sea, the development of Kitan is the another key step in Eni's longer term vision of discovering and producing hydrocarbons in what is thought to be an area with strong future potential. Community Relations: In Australia Eni invests in establishing successful and positive relations with its host communities through constructive contributions and the ability to put new energy and development opportunities into them. Eni strives to contribute positively to the social and economic development of the communities associated with operations. The community mainly involved with operations is Wadeye, in the Thamarrurr Region of the Northern Territory, located near the Blacktip onshore gas plant. The Blacktip Project developed over the period from discovery in 2001 through to first production in 2009, supplies gas to the Northern Territory's Power Water Corporation for electricity generation and other domestic gas uses. In 2007, in accordance with the eni Guidelines for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, Eni Australia developed
a specific Indigenous peoples' policy managing relations with local communities. Social impact management, derived from undertaking solid baseline analysis, coupled with thorough identification of social impacts, has been used to establish a clear understanding of the socio-political, cultural and economic situation of the project's area of influence. This work, involving consultation and input from relevant local stakeholders, has allowed Eni to systematically implement a Social Impact Management Plan that has applied appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate potential negative effects of its activity in the area, as well as to enhance positive effects.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"DEAL PROFILE
The $3.45 billion bid for coal seam gas player Arrow Energy by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina is moving into a critical stage, with tensions lingering over what would be China's second-biggest investment in Australia.
 Not least of these tensions is the possibility of a competing offer emerging once the scheme documents are published within the next few days. While many in the market have ruled this out, insiders point out it will be the first time potential rival bidders will be able to weigh up the $4.70 per share offer against an independent valuation of Arrow's Australian assets, unclouded by the soon to be demerged international business.
Assessments of the bid in terms of dollars per gigajoule leave room for manoeuvre, while uncertainty over the impact of the federal government's resource super profits tax, combined with the recent related weakness in Arrow's share price, means neither side is ruling out the risk of an alternative bidder making a late play. Keen international appetite for unconventional gas and Arrow's status as Australia's largest holder of coal seam gas acreage adds to the stakes.
 This is the last independent coal seam gas company in Australia,  one banker said.  The space is now dominated by ConocoPhillips, Petronas, BG and now Shell-PetroChina, all very large majors. So if someone else wanted to come into the space, the only other resource available out there is the Arrow resource. 
At least recent jitters over whether the resource super profits tax would prompt the bidders to trim their cash offer price for Arrow have abated, with many taking the view that they would have done so before the scheme documents were lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on May 21.
Sources in the Arrow camp argue that the uncertainty over the final form of the RSPT makes it difficult to justify exercising the  material adverse change  clause in the transaction contract.
But others close to the bidding group say the RSPT is still a serious, unresolved issue.  There is a lot of work going on in The Hague and Beijing to try to come to a view on just what the impact is,  said one source. The results of those deliberations are due to be aired in meetings between Shell and PetroChina, with the aim of reconciling their views within the next crucial six to seven weeks.
The initial approach to Arrow's board by Shell and PetroChina on Friday, March 5 took Arrow by surprise, forcing it into a last-minute cancellation of an investor roadshow in London the following week. But the conditional cash offer of $4.45 a share for Arrow's Australian assets had been germinating for some time and followed many months of talks between the partners.
From the start the bidders were focused solely on Arrow's Queensland gas resources, with a view to using them for a liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone. The link-up between the bidders, which originated at the highest levels in Shell and PetroChina, combines Shell's global expertise in LNG projects with PetroChina's access to the fastest-growing LNG market.
While using coal seam gas for LNG remains commercially untested, Shell knows Arrow's resources well, having bought 30 per cent of its coal seam gas acreage in mid-2008 and with five secondees in the target company. Two weeks of intense negotiations later, described as  extremely robust  by Shell Australia chairman Russell Caplan â€“ Shell, PetroChina and Arrow agreed to a recommended $4.70 per share cash offer, with Arrow shareholders also getting shares in the international business, to be spun off as Dart Energy.
Shell, represented in the negotiations mostly by executive vice-president of new business Guy Outen, is being advised by Rothschild, with Allens Arthur Robinson as legal representative. PetroChina is being advised by Morgan Stanley, with Blake Dawson on the legal side. Citigroup and UBS are advising Arrow, with Gilbert + Tobin as legal representative.
Arrow had already planned an IPO of its international unit, smoothing the way for the Dart spin-off. But getting value for international exploration assets on the Australian market has always proved difficult. Valuations of Dart range from 83Â¢ a share by Deutsche Bank to 98Â¢ a share by Macquarie, yet Arrow shares recently fell as low as $4.54, indicating no value ascribed to Dart.
Shell and PetroChina have undertaken their own negotiations to agree a value for Shell's Australian goal seam gas assets which are going into their 50-50 venture alongside Arrow. PetroChina is understood to be contributing funds to match the value of those assets, comprising Shell's 30 per cent of Arrow's licences and its planned LNG project in Gladstone.
The transaction still requires a number of approvals. Clearance from the Foreign Investment Review Board has not proved to be the stumbling block some initially suggested, with insiders pointing to the  market disciplines  arising from Shell's involvement balancing out the China state firm's participation.
The deal must still secure regulatory approval from China's National Development and Reform Commission, but groundwork so far looks to have paved the way for this.
Arrow shareholder approval will be sought at meetings scheduled for mid-July, but 16.7 per cent shareholder New Hope Corp has already voiced its support.
The demerger is expected to be implemented in late July, followed by the acquisition in early August.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"WOODSIDE SYDNEY, June 3 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd has met all its obligations regarding the Sunrise liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, managing director and chief executive Don Voelte says.
 Woodside has fulfilled all its obligations under international treaties,  Mr Voelte told the UBS Resources conference in Sydney on Thursday in prepared remarks.
 Sunrise is located in waters between Australia and East Timor, and the joint venture partners recently unanimously selected a floating LNG platform to develop the project.
The other two options - piping the LNG back to a processing plant in East Timor or Darwin - were rejected.
Piping the oil to East Timor had the highest capital cost and significant technical risks, Mr Voelte said.
But the East Timor authorities have expressed a desire for the LNG to be processed in the Asian nation.
Mr Voelte said the floating LNG platform option had  robust economics, maximising total revenue to Australia and Timor-Leste and maximising the return to the Sunrise joint venture .
 We have selected the concept that provides best commercial advantage consistent with good oilfield practice,  Mr Voelte said.
 While I cannot get into the specific details on the economics of Sunrise floating LNG development, I can say that at this stage in the development the calculated returns are robust and exceed all Woodside's threshold economic hurdle rates. 
Mr Voelte said East Timor would earn about $US13 billion ($A15.45 billion) over the life of the project from its 18 per cent share of the gas, while Australia stood to take home about $US19 billion ($A22.58 billion) from its 82 per cent share.
At 1102 AEST, Woodside was up 55 cents, or 1.27 per cent, at $43.98, on a day when the broader market was up about 1.6 per cent.
Apart from Woodside, which will operate the project, the joint-venture partners also include Conoco Phillips, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Osaka Gas.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Australia's liquefied natural gas hopefuls are set to face additional challenges in selling their product into China's emerging market after Chinese authorities approved a 25 per cent increase in domestic gas prices.
The ruling is expected to increase gas reserves and production within China at the expense of alternative sources such as Australian LNG imports, analysts warned.
 While the price rise will encourage further development and production of Chinese gas reserves, the gas will still be a far cheaper source compared with alternatives such as LNG.
Under the price increase, Macquarie Research estimates Chinese gas prices, including processing charges and tariffs, will rise to around $US6.85 per million British thermal units.
That remains substantially below the estimated $US11.75/mmBtu under current Japanese LNG contracts.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said the Chinese price increase, coupled with the federal government's proposed 40 per cent resource super profits tax, could hurt proposed Australian LNG projects.
 This incentivisation of gas production in China comes at a time when the proposed RSPT threatens to limit some of Australia's LNG projects,  Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said in a research note.
 The net effect of these divergent government policies is ultimately likely to result in less Australian LNG heading to the increasingly significant Chinese market. 
While China accounted for less than 2 per cent of global LNG imports in 2009, its expanding economy and desire for cleaner burning sources of energy make it an increasingly important destination for Australian LNG.
Chinese state-owned energy giant CNOOC buys LNG from the Woodside Petroleum-operated North West Shelf project in Western Australia, and has agreed to buy substantial LNG volumes from BG Group's proposed Queensland Curtis LNG project, while fellow state-owned company PetroChina has agreed to buy ExxonMobil's share of LNG production from the under-construction Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia.
Despite the projections of strong gas demand growth in China, the country is also touted as prospective for the unconventional gas resources that have emerged dramatically in Queensland and the United States in recent years.
Major Chinese company Sinopec has announced plans to substantially increase its unconventional gas production out of China, while Australian-listed Sino Gas & Energy and Dart Energy, which will be spun out of coal seam gas company Arrow Energy, are both hunting for coal seam gas reserves in China.
The country is also well located to source more gas from Russia.
 Even under our significantly above-consensus Chinese gas demand forecasts, the Chinese gas market already looks reasonably well supplied out to 2020 with significant growth expected in domestic production from conventional reservoirs,  Mr Wood said.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"Roche's â€œmind-numbing commentsâ€? show dire need for CSG moratorium
If ever there was an advocate for a moratorium on Coal Seam Gas development (CSG) across Australia it's the Chief Executive of the Queensland Resources Council, Michael Roche.
 In his speech to the Surat Coal and Energy Conference on May 20 this year Mr Roche apparently made some mind-numbing comments.
In specifically addressing the concerns about the proposed expansion of the CSG industry onto the Darling Downs, home to our most productive food producing soils, he specifically said he did not accept the â€œloftyâ€? notion that Queensland has some responsibility for feeding the world.
His reasoning included that China and India were increasing food production and quality as they became more industrialised.
He also went on to say, â€œThe Queensland Resources Council is concerned that certain government agencies are looking to force through arrangements for â€œprotectingâ€? (his use of quotation) this so-called (his expression) strategic cropping land.â€?
He later called it the â€œsupposedâ€? strategic cropping land.
Sydney is complaining it is running out of productive land close enough to get produce to it, we are constantly told south-east Queensland and Australia's population will grow exponentially, scientists all over the world warn us about the imminence of world food shortages but Mr Roche apparently thinks China and India will be fine.
Well that's a relief.
Maybe the logic the resource industry wants to convey is that we can sacrifice Australia's food production capability and farming land because China and India will feed the world and we can always import.
Given the rush of Chinese investment in our resource industries wouldn't that be a touch ironic?

Dalby, Quo Vadis?
If you are a shop owner with an alarm system, it's not unusual to be woken up during the night by a phone call, usually at weekends and past midnight, to be told by the security centre that an attempt has just been made to enter your premises.
Bleary-eyed and a bit dopey from the pills you take to make you sleep through the night, you hop in the car and race to your shop to find the siren blaring and lights flashing.
You carefully and cautiously search the premises, and hopefully find that the attempt was unsuccessful, or a case of one of the hotels' late customers deciding to relieve themselves in the doorway.
Last Saturday early morning was the dreaded exception.
On arrival we found one of the display windows smashed, and items on display missing or damaged by the smashed security glass.
We called the police, who promptly arrived, followed later by local security people.
Then followed a lengthy and dangerous clean-up, a call to the local glass supply people to temporarily barricade the window until a new security glass could be installed.
We are what other people would call â€˜an elderly couple' in our late 70s and early 80s, with some 40-plus years of serving the people of Dalby and the wide surrounding area.
While we were cleaning up the ruined display, we were surprised at the number of teenagers and young adults loitering in the main street at that hour of the night, some obviously drunk, finding it hard to stay upright, others in groups, yelling and screening obscenities, an obvious danger to any law-abiding citizen â€“ a picture we found hard to connect with the image we have held of â€œour townâ€?, where we have brought up our seven children, now successful adults with families and children of their own, of all of whom we feel nothing but pride.
During those long early morning hours, there were two young teenage girls, who actually stopped and offered to help.
The damage in this case alone will run into several thousand dollars.
We sincerely hope that the town's expensive surveillance camera system will help police track down these individuals, who cause so much expense and misery to others, and allow the justice system to properly deal with them, so that they realise that such behaviour is inexcusable and commands punishment, during which the misguided culprits might hopefully re-evaluate their current miserable lives and bring themselves back on the â€œstraight and narrowâ€? and lead a normal, useful life, so that their parents and the rest of the Dalby community can again treat them with respect as normal human beings.

Serious planning needed to get â€œbest of both worldsâ€?
US scientist and expert in the Coal Seam Gas (CSM) field, Wyoming State Geological Survey geologist Fred McLaughlin, said CSM is â€œrelatively safeâ€? and that we have little to fear.
He comments that with 10,000 wells we may have a similar drawdown to their 231m which is concerning when we have 40,000 wells planned in the Surat Basin alone.
With our reliance on the Great Artesian Basin as the lifeblood of the interior, this is just a tad concerning.
On the impact, Queensland Resources Minister Robertson says he doesn't know, CSM companies say they will have an impact but can't say how much and they will monitor, the CSM companies have stripped the Queensland Environmental Protection Authority of many of its most experienced managers, and the Co-ordinator General is assessing 37 â€œsignificantâ€? projects (with the EPA staff now working for the proponents anyway).
Reportedly, our Premier is gushing about planned new billion-dollar liquid natural gas (LNG) plants, while in the US, President Obama said he has a problem because â€œIn this instance, the oil industry's cosy and sometimes corrupt relationship with government regulators meant little or no regulation at all.â€?
We all recognise the benefits that the CSM projects can bring to state and national economies, but not at any cost, and not at the cost of the loss of one great industry (agriculture) which hired 11,000 workers in the Great Financial Crisis.
Mining laid off thousands, which, if replicated, would have meant 19 percent unemployment nationally.
With a little serious planning we could have the best of both worlds.
The relationship between the state and CSM companies in Qld is just too cosy.
This week, Michael Roche of the Queensland Resources Council assured us the CSM water extraction would not affect the Great Artesian Basin and we could import all our food from China and India anyway.
And President Obama thinks he's got a problem!

Roche out of touch
I felt it was imperative that I respond to the very one sided, out of touch report by Mr Roche.
At the third Surat Coal and Energy Conference, CEO of Queensland Resource Council, Michael Roche spoke of media reports that â€œlandholders are threatening blockades against companies carrying out exploration activities.â€?
He went on to say that â€œsuch course of action is entirely up to landholders but it's indicative of the level of confusion surrounding the rights of property owners.â€?
Michael Roche is correct; landholders are undeniably confused and frustrated.
Landholders are confused as to why the State Government and gas companies say that the Coal Seam Gas (CSG) industry is not taking up to 350,000 million litres of water annually from the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) when the coal seams are clearly identified in the GAB Resource Operations Plan as aquifers that must not be further allocated.
I would like to know where all this water is coming from if it is not the GAB?
Landholders are confused as to why they cannot have legal representation at land access mediation, and why Minister Stephen Robertson said in a radio interview with Jane Patterson on ABC radio that if access agreement is not met, CSG companies cannot enter properties.
In actual fact, if agreement is not achieved at mediation the case goes to land court and instant property access is given to the CSG company.
Landholders are confused as to why the CSG industry is being given the go ahead when much of the Government's own research into environmental impacts such as the impacts from draining large areas of the GAB, the interconnectivity between aquifers, the management of millions of tonnes of salt and its potential impact on the land and river systems of the Murray Darling Basin is yet to start.
Landholders are confused on how CSG companies are going to make good water loss when there is no unallocated water available, or even worse, no water available at all.
What is a CSG company going to tell a grazier if his cattle or sheep die from lack of water when a bore goes dry? Sorry?
Landholders are confused when they Google Coal Bed Methane and read some of the thousands of reports about the health and environmental impacts that the CSG industry is accused of causing in the USA and Canada.
In such countries, where the industry has been operating for a number of years, it is reported they will be facing much tougher legislation to prevent further health and environmental harm.
What really takes the cake in confusion is Michael Roche's comments when he says the â€œreasons why I have difficulty in accepting the lofty notion sometimes peddled in the debate about competing land uses that Queensland has a responsibility for feeding the world when it is clear that:
â€œFood quality and production in countries like China have improved dramatically over the past decades.â€?
Is this man so out of touch with reality that he honestly believes that it is acceptable for the CSG industry to destroy or severely impact premium food producing farmland and force people to import their food from countries like China?
A country that is currently importing millions of tonnes of corn from the US because it has production problems of its own?
The world is short of water and food. Not coal, not methane gas...food!
The State Government must stop focusing on the dollars and look at what Queensland really needs, good natural resource governance.
Wake up Queenslanders!
Don't allow the destruction of our environment, our ability to provide clean water, food and fibre to families, to future generations and people less fortunate than ourselves.

Returning phone calls not Council's forte?
Can any body tell me â€“ every time I make a phone call to Western Downs Regional Council, to speak to an engineer about the state of the roads out here at Ducklo Gulera Road, Redgum Road and all the other gravel roads in this area...they are either not there or at a meeting.
I feel sorry for the ladies at reception having to tell the rate payers that these people are too busy to speak to the constituents and as for returning my calls, this does not happen often.
They should not hold that position â€“ after all I am a rate payer and I think I do deserve at least that courtesy.
Everybody in these positions seem to pass the buck and if that is the case then all councillors should be looking at their staff to ensure that ratepayers are being heard and not ignored as nuisances.
The Mayor, Cr Brown, has himself said that the roads are really bad but has not done any thing about them.
Do we have to wait until there is a major accident on these roads before we get some action?
Queensland Gas Company (QGC) is using these roads with heavy and wide load vehicles putting residents, particularly school children at risk.
What has life in the bush come to when one company, QGC, can damage roads and no one does anything about it.
It's about time some councillors got off their back sides, stopped the rhetoric and started fighting for their constituents who elected them into office to represent the people or will we only see them or hear from them come election time?

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Royal Dutch Shell's move to spend $US4.7 billion ($5.6 billion) expanding its shale gas interests in the United States is the latest endorsement of a burgeoning sector that has already drawn interest from Australian-listed companies such as Beach Energy, Santos and AWE.
Shell said this week it would acquire private equity-backed group East Resources in the latest of a string of multibillion-dollar acquisitions in the US shale gas industry, which has grown in recent years from a niche business into a major supply source for US gas demand. The growth of the industry has all but eliminated liquefied natural gas imports into the US and has contributed to a substantial fall in US domestic gas prices.
 While the shale gas industry is still in its infancy in Australia, Adelaide-based Beach and Sydney-based AWE have both dramatically stepped up their efforts to replicate the US success.
AWE managing director Bruce Wood told The Australian Financial Review that Shell's latest major acquisition further validated his company's foray into the sector.
 Shale gas is now a major part of world gas supply. Not only is it 15Â per cent of the largest gas market in the world, it will in fact become more prevalent in a lot of places around the world,  Mr Wood said.
 It's going to alter the nature of the supply-demand balance around the world. When countries that now import LNG begin to develop their own shale gas industries, that will [have an] impact on the market. 
While the gas content of shale has long been known, it has historically been ignored due to the difficulty of extracting gas from the rock. The pores in shale are much smaller and further apart than those in conventional gas host rocks, which makes it difficult for gas to flow through and up wells.
However, technical advances in recent years in fracturing â€“ the process in which controlled underground blasts of pressure fracture the shale and open up its pores â€“ and horizontal drilling of wells through the shale layers, has greatly reduced the cost and improved the reliability of extracting gas from shale.
In addition to the $4.7 billion acquisition of East Resources, which is backed by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Shell has spent $US1 billion this year acquiring 1000 square kilometres of undeveloped shale gas prospects in Texas.
Shell chief executive Peter Voser said the company was aiming to grow and improve the quality of its North American unconventional gas portfolio.
 The opportunity now is to consolidate our tight gas portfolio, divest from non-core positions across North America, and to invest for profitable growth, by deploying Shell's technology and capabilities on a large scale,  Mr Voser said.
Shell's acquisitions pale in comparison to ExxonMobil's acquisition of shale gas player XTO energy last December. In that deal, Exxon paid $US31 billion and assumed $US10 billion in debt.
Australia's shale gas industry is several years behind that of the US. Beach and AWE are trying to grow in-house expertise before stepping up their exploration efforts.
Beach is drilling two shale gas wells in South Australia's Cooper Basin, with an aim of establishing a pilot project by the end of next year.
Mr Wood said AWE was looking for further shale gas opportunities in Australia and overseas.
 We're looking for other opportunities where we can make a difference,  he said.  Shale is unconventional, it's difficult in lots of ways, but it is very rewarding when you get it right.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"The looming sale of coal-seam gas play Arrow Energy to international energy giants Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina is another step closer Â­after an independent expert's report found the pair's offer to be fair and reasonable.
The report, prepared by accounting firm Deloitte, found the fair value of Arrow's Queensland coal-seam gas assets to be $4 to $4.40 a share, compared with the Shell-PetroChina offer of $4.70 a share.
 Deloitte's calculations on the value of Arrow did not take into account the likely impact of the federal Â­government's contentious resources Â­super profit tax (RSPT), although the firm noted that the new impost was  likely to reduce the value of an Â­Arrow share . CLSA analyst Di Brookman noted that the Shell-PetroChina Â­offer represented only a 7 per cent to 17 per cent premium to Deloitte's valuation of Arrow's Queensland business.
 That's normally on the low side, but the bugger is that's probably the reality because of the RSPT,  Ms Brookman said.
Ms Brookman has argued that the offer does not reflect the full value of Arrow, but admitted the uncertainty created by the RSPT meant the current Shell-PetroChina bid was highly likely to succeed.
 We feel the Arrow domestic business is going out the door cheaply,  Ms Brookman said.
 Unfortunately, that all became clouded and murky the moment we had this RSPT come on the table. 
Securing an independent expert's report that found the offer to be fair and reasonable was the last key condition to be cleared ahead of the coming vote on the offer by Arrow shareholders.
Shareholders will vote on the proposal on July 14, at which point they will also vote to spin off Arrow's international coal-seam gas projects and its equity investments into a vehicle called Dart Energy.
Under the spin-off, Arrow shareholders will receive one new share in Dart for each share they hold in Â­Arrow. Analyst valuations of the share have ranged from 23Â¢ to 84Â¢, while Deloitte in its report valued the share at 50Â¢ to 60Â¢.
The firm did, however, warn that Dart could be the subject to an Â­exodus of shareholders after it lists.
Dart, which has exploration projects in China, Indonesia, India and Vietnam, is at a far earlier stage of its development than Arrow.
 Combined with its offshore Â­strategy, Dart Energy's risk/return and market capitalisation will not likely meet the investment mandate of a significant proportion of Â­Arrow's shareholders, most notably institutional investors,  the report says.
 Accordingly, there is likely to be a significant turnover in Dart Energy shares once the demerger is implemented.  Dart's new chief executive Simon Potter addressed an investment conference in Sydney yesterday, arguing that the company's former Arrow management was aiming to establish presences in high-growth markets ahead of competitors.
Dart's efforts in China were boosted this week after the government ruled that gas prices could increase by 25 per cent, a move that is likely to encourage further gas production within China.
Mr Potter said Dart was aiming to define proven and probable reserves by next year, ahead of first production in 2012.
Dart is scheduled to begin trading on the Australian Stock Exchange on July 22, assuming the demerger isÂ­ Â­approved by Arrow shareholders.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte says the East Timor government's preferred development option for the Greater Sunrise liquefied natural gas project would cost $US5 billion ($6 billion) more than the floating LNG development selected by the project's partners.
In the latest escalation in the ongoing war of words between Woodside and the East Timor government, Mr Voelte said in a speech in Sydney yesterday that developing Sunrise through a facility in East Timor did not stack up.
  We found there were no technical impediments to [an LNG plant in East Timor], however it was the highest capital cost by approximately $US5 billion compared to floating LNG and presents significant technical risks,  Mr Voelte said.
Woodside and its partners in Sunrise, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips, are headed for an impasse with East Timor over the project. Both the East Timor and Australian governments need to approve it for development.
The substantial gas field straddles the maritime border between Australia and the Joint Petroleum Development Area, a region 90 per cent-owned by East Timor and 10Â per cent by Australia.
Woodside and its partners earlier this year decided to develop Sunrise through a revolutionary floating LNG facility moored directly over the field in the Timor Sea. The partners had also been considering piping the gas to a facility in Darwin, after ruling out piping the gas to a dedicated LNG plant in East Timor. But the East Timorese government has vowed to oppose the plans, arguing it wants the associated infrastructure and employment benefits that come from an LNG plant on its own soil.
Earlier this week, East Timor secretary of state Agio Pereira reiterated his government's opposition, saying a pipeline between Sunrise and East Timor was  the only way forward in the monetisation of its resource .
 An equitable distribution of benefits between the two countries, Australia and Timor-Leste, and their peoples, is an irrecusable imperative in this joint development,  he said.
Mr Pereira also warned that the yet-to-be proven floating LNG technology could experience cost blowouts that would undercut revenues to East Timor.  Timor-Leste, a poor country highly dependent on petroleum revenue, more than any other country cannot and will not responsibly accept such high levels of uncertainty and risk. 
Mr Voelte unveiled new projected estimates that challenged MrÂ Pereira's assertion that the royalties from Sunrise would be split unfavourably for East Timor. About 80 per cent of the Sunrise fields sit in Australian waters, with the rest in the JPDA. Concessions agreed on in 2007 allow for the project's royalties to effectively be split 40-60 between East Timor and Australia.
Mr Voelte said East Timor would collect $US13 million over the life of the project for its 18 per cent share, while the Australian government would collect $US19Â billion.
 Woodside has fulfilled all its obligations under international treaties. We have selected the concept that provides best commercial advantage consistent with good oilfield practice. We have submitted a floating LNG selection report which includes feasibility studies on all three options with very clear reasoning behind our decision. Now it is the regulator's turn to act. 
While Sunrise sits closer to the East Timor coast, a 3000-metre deep, seismically active ocean trench makes piping the gas to that nation costly.

Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said he was confident a deal between the Rudd government and the burgeoning liquified natural gas industry over the resource super profits tax was imminent.
 He and Premier Anna Bligh have been involved in negotiations behind the scenes to ensure the LNG industry is not disadvantaged by the new tax. They want to ensure big producers such as Santos, BG and Origin are able to go ahead with Queensland projects this year.
The talks have revolved around transitional arrangements for the LNG industry, rather than an exemption from the new tax.
 We've been working closely with the proponents,  Mr Fraser said.  We think it's close to getting across the line and we want to make it get there. 
The Bligh government has predicted a 28 million tonne-a-year LNG industry could add more than $3 billion, or about 1 per cent, to gross state product.

EAST Timor has accused Woodside of  grandstanding  over its plans to build a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the Timor Sea's Greater Sunrise field, in the latest salvo in an acrimonious stand-off over the multibillion-dollar project.
 Government spokesman Agio Pereira accused Woodside's chief executive Don Voelte of trying to justify what he called the company's  untenable  position when he told the UBS Resources Conference this week that it was  time for this project's day in the sun .
 Let me be very clear, this time, Timor Leste (East Timor) has the knowledge, expertise, international support and time to get this right and ensure a fair and equitable outcome,  Mr Pereira said in a statement released in Dili.
East Timor's leaders have bluntly rejected Woodside's plans, insisting the company and its joint-venture partners pipe its gas to a processing plant in East Timor.
Woodside claims it has formally lodged a development plan with the National Petroleum Authority, regulator of East Timor's petroleum industry, as it is required to do under the Greater Sunrise agreement signed 2Â½ years ago.
But the authority insists the company has not fulfilled its legal requirements under the agreement and says the plan has not been accepted.
 The ball's back in Woodside's court,  Mr Pereira said.  Woodside can grandstand through the media and speeches or they can do their due diligence, required to re-establish the processes necessary through the appropriate mechanisms,  he said.
Mr Pereira reiterated his government's stand that a floating platform  does not provide the best commercial advantage in line with best oilfield practice .
He said that while Woodside claimed that East Timor would receive $US13 billion ($A15.3 billion) in income from the floating platform, it would make at least $US65 billion if the gas was processed on shore.
Mr Pereira said Mr Voelte failed to share with his conference audience that if the development plan was not approved by 2013 or if Sunrise LNG production has not started by 2017, the project agreement could be cancelled and Sunrise activity suspended until a new agreement could be negotiated.
Woodside declined to comment last night.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"`When you extract CSG or petroleum you get water with it' - Matthew Paull
MINERS will take about 350,000megalitres of water a year out of the Great Artesian Basin via the emerging coal seam gas industry but will not need a state permit to do so.
 Farmers operating in the same area must apply for a permit to draw relatively minor amounts of water.
Basin Sustainability Alliance chairman Ian Hayllor said it was unfair that the two industries faced different requirements.
Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association director Matthew Paull said petroleum and gas miners drew water simply because it was a byproduct to coal or petroleum extraction. ``You can't get one without the other,'' Mr Paull said. ``When you extract CSG or petroleum you get water with it. The two issues aren't comparable.''
Another major difference was that allocations for agriculture were on an indefinite basis.
Mr Hayllor said it was ironic that the Government's Great Artesian Basin Resource Operations Plan was aimed at sustainable management when one of the nation's great resources would be depleted and probably polluted by mining.
``Mine companies will also bring about two million tonnes of salt to the surface each year in the water,'' he said.
Mr Hayllor said the Government's administration of the issue was erratic and the farm community's view on extractions was backed by a National Water Commission report released last week which called for mining to operate under the same rules as other water users.
Mines Minister Stephen Robertson said that in terms of water supply and planning, mining was considered in the same way as other industries.
Opposition Primary Industries spokesman Ray Hopper said the Government had to ensure there was no irreparable damage to aquifers in pursuit of profits.
``It is critically important the Government makes every attempt to understand the long-term impact of the latest and fast-moving development of gas extraction,'' Mr Hopper said.
National Water Commission chief executive Ken Matthews said that since the National Water Initiative was signed in 2004, the minerals, petroleum, coal seam gas and related industries had almost by default been left out of broader water markets and water-planning processes.
Mr Hayllor said farmers were terrified of water being contaminated by deep gas wells.
``We can't let the Government get away with this,'' Mr Hayllor said. ``This is the nation's future.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"OUT west beyond the Great Dividing Range, among the plains and their hidden gas reserves, there's a degree of caution from a few people about borrowing money.
Sure, the area is a potential boom zone thanks to the new black gold: coal seam gas.
 That means people and businesses, big and small, will need to borrow so they can either build that boom or feed off it.
But caution lingers, with some projects having been delayed previously, or with uncertainty surrounding the viability of farmland.
These are among the issues that banks may consider, along with the risks and rewards, when it comes to lending into Queensland's next big resources prize.
The risks include energy prices crashing, projects stalling or a property blip emerging. The rewards range from funding multinational energy companies to making loans for small fish-and-chip shops that feed hordes of gas workers and their families.
Some enterprises have already tapped into the boom with the help of finance, such as Chinchilla-based bus company Maguire Coaches.
Maguire has expanded from one 19-seat Toyota Coaster bus in 1987 to almost 12 vehicles, due in no small part to work ferrying staff to gas sites, says co-founder Kaye Maguire.
Still, Ms Maguire says that some other businesses are cautious about borrowing, as delays have struck projects.
``People have geared up for booms before and so they're a little bit reluctant to jump in too quickly,'' she says.
Further east towards Dalby, Ian Hallyor, of the Basin Sustainability Alliance, says some farmers are ``not totally happy that our banks are lending to the gas companies''.
``We think the gas companies are going to have an impact on our businesses,'' he says.
Mr Hallyor, who grows grains, oilseeds and legumes on a property bought in 1982, claims the problem is poor government regulation of the environmental impact of coal seam gas on farmland.
It could reduce the land's productivity, Mr Hallyor fears. He's already talked to banks.
``We could be viewed as a less secure asset, I hope that doesn't happen,'' he says.
Bankers argue they can lend to both farmers and the gas industry or associated enterprises.
Suncorp bank chief David Foster says: ``They're very different propositions and risks.''
He also says farmers have a diverse range of views about the gas industry.
An important spin-off for banks will be the build-up of ``central hubs'', such as Toowoomba, Mr Foster says.
Those hubs should stretch to Gladstone, where the coal seam gas will be converted into liquid natural gas.
Martin Barrett, the Queensland head of lender St George, is eyeing off opportunities to help small business customers, who will conceivably borrow more money to tap into the ``significant opportunities'' from projects. ``Many small businesses actually struggle
to be able to connect that up,'' he says.
ANZ is sending a team to Gladstone this August to look at projects, subcontractors and issues such as the impact on housing markets.
``In Gladstone, you're going to have a major influx of people into the area, for a short period of time. Does that mean you'll need three million housing loans which will disappear in two years' time? They're the questions you've got to ask yourself,'' ANZ's Queensland chairman Russell Shields says.
With mortgages comes concern about a housing bubble in some towns. But Suncorp's Foster says valuers will assess what is a sustainable value for properties.
Large earnings will come from financing the big projects, and this is a market for the Big Four banks among local lenders.
Just last December, the PNG LNG Project secured $US14 billion in funding promises from export credit agencies and commercial banks. ANZ is a key banker for the project.
Mr Shields says an opportunity lies in a lead bank being able to parcel out loans to various lenders across Asia. ``You need that distribution capability. It's hellishly important,'' he says.
Suncorp used to be in loans for big projects - back in December 2007 it signed a $70 million deal for Arrow Energy - but it has ceased following a withdrawal from some forms of lending such as syndicated finance.
The lure of new lending will not necessarily spawn bank branches in emerging hot zones.
``We're not going to put in a branch just because there's a single project that produces a big uplift for the next couple of years,'' Bank of Queensland chief operating officer Ram Kangatharan says.
``We actually look at it a lot more longer term. In terms of the development of a particular region, is there enough population coming into that region as well as other businesses that would indicate that employment prospects are pretty stable over the next five to
10 years?
``It really takes two or three large projects in a region to run for a couple of years before we make a decision on opening a branch.''
A major threat is projects stalling. Memories stretch back to Australian Magnesium Corporation's $1.4 billion light metals project near Rockhampton falling over in 2003.
Such a CSG-LNG project failure would flow on, conceivably, to contractors losing work and so not buying houses or fish and chips.
Richard Kennerley, general manager of NAB business in Queensland, says a potential risk to the overall resource boom lies in ``the sustainability and future demand'' of commodities. There was also ``a reliance on China'', he says. ``Our view would be that's an acceptable risk. This (industry) is clearly not a five-minute wonder.''
ANZ's Queensland natural resources executive director Bill Nagl says risks range from understanding energy-price volatility to the technical risk of extracting CSG. ``All of those will need to be adequately covered off,'' he says.
Opportunity is still coalescing for banks, rather than triggering a lending frenzy. In Toowoomba, Mr Foster says people are ``very conscious there's the promise of much to come''.
``But they're not putting the cart before the horse.''

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"LNG By Petrina Berry
BRISBANE, June 8 AAP - Farmers and environmentalists fear rapid growth in the natural gas industry in Queensland could put communities at risk from pipeline explosions.
 A blast in the US state of Texas on Monday spewed towering flames into the air for about two hours and left one person unaccounted for.
Veteran environmental campaigner Drew Hutton, who is now a full-time lobbyist for Surat Basin farmers, said the explosion was an example of the dangers of gas pipelines which are multiplying in Queensland because of lucrative liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
Santos, Origin Energy and BG Group are both planning multi-billion dollar projects to turn coal seam gas from the Surat Basin into LNG in Gladstone and exports could begin from 2014.
The state government gave an environmental approval to Santos' joint venture with Malaysia's state-owned oil company Petronas last month, which includes development of coal seam gas resources in the Bowen and Surat Basins around Roma in the state's central west, and construction of a 435km pipeline to the Queensland coast.
Mr Hutton said the Queensland government had allowed mining companies to plant gas wells and gas pipelines within metres of houses.
He said dozens of gas wells exist cheek-by-jowl with residents in an estate near Tara, west of Brisbane.
 This is a dangerous industry made even more so by the fact the Queensland government has fast-tracked these developments with little time for regulators to assess risk,  Mr Hutton said.
 They have given the companies a tick-the-box, low level environmental approval for gas extraction, compression and pumping for the domestic market ... 
Mr Hutton said he believed every gas well in the Tara area had some form of leak.
Queensland is set to build a major LNG plant between Chinchilla and Tara and four plants at Gladstone.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"A PROPOSED $3.5 billion takeover of Arrow Energy has become more attractive to shareholders since the Federal Government announced its controversial resources super profit tax, the Queensland coal seam gas player said yesterday.
Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina agreed in March to buy Arrow's Australian business for $4.70 a share in cash. The deal will give Shell access to Arrow's coal seam gas reserves to support a proposed Curtis Island LNG project.
 ``Arrow would face uncertainty if the company were to proceed independently with a plan to develop a liquefied natural gas project in Queensland,'' Arrow's CEO Shaun Scott said yesterday.
Arrow chairman John Reynolds said that the takeover and spin-off of a new company, Dart Energy, were both ``on plan, on time and on target''.
Mr Scott said Arrow had not discussed with Shell/PetroChina any potential change to the terms of the takeover to account for the proposed RSPT, announced on May 2.
``With the uncertainty sitting there, in terms of a development scenario versus a certain amount of cash in hand, the thing about cash is that it's certain,'' he said.
``That would make it look much more attractive than it possibly would have.''

Computer giant IBM will announce today the establishment of a new facility in Western Australia dedicated to research and development in mining, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petroleum industry processes.
 IBM executives have confirmed the Natural Resources Solution Centre (NRSC), based in Perth, has been in the pipeline for over a year and will focus on developing technology strategies designed to help mining clients reduce exploration and operational costs.
One of the new centre's experts, David Haake, said the project had not been hit by the mining sector backlash to the federal government's resource super profits tax, despite companies threatening to cut Australian research investment.
He said WA was the world's headquarters for both mining and LNG â€“ two of the biggest industries.
 Regardless of the trajectory of their future capital investments, they already own a trillion dollars worth of assets and what we're about is optimising those assets â€“ making them cheaper, better and faster,  he said.
Mr Haake said the NRSC would be attached to IBM's Perth development laboratory, which already employs about 150 people.
 We have brought in eight new subject-matter experts,  he said.  And we already have open tickets in the range of 30 [employees] a quarter. So there's a pretty broad-based staff build-up happening. 
He said market interest would determine how large the centre would become, but in the past six months the lab had added about 40 staff. There was an expectation that the NRSC would grow to include at least 100 researchers in the next four years, he said.
IBM's WA state manager, Bill Stewart, said Râ€Š&â€ŠD efforts would be conducted in collaboration with the West Australian research community and technology supplier Honeywell, which is one of the big technology players in the LNG industry.
 We've commenced discussions with WA:ERA (Western Australian Energy Research Alliance),  Mr Stewart said.  It is a local Râ€Š&â€ŠD community put together by the CSIRO, WA University and Curtin University of Technology to look at energy research. 
Mr Stewart said the centre would focus on developing systems as well as business strategies to help mining companies to re-evaluate technology use.
He said the new centre was undertaking two proof of concepts with mining clients.

MACQUARIEâ€™S equity desk believes the federal government may be ready to cut a deal to ensure that Queenslandâ€™s $40 billion investment boom in liquefied natural gas projects proceeds as planned.
 According to Macquarie analysts, the deal would involve carving out the coal seam gas to LNG projects from the proposed 40 per cent resources rent tax (RRT) and letting them operate under the decades-old petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) regime.
The call comes as the government continues, publicly at least, its hard line on any changes to the proposed RRT. Macquarieâ€™s call on a deal is believed to have followed financial community briefings last Friday in Sydney by federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson.
Macquarie said that allowing the CSG-to-LNG projects to operate under the PRRT would â€˜â€˜ensure consistency across the Australian LNG space, letting the market determine the most viable projects, rather than government policyâ€™â€™.
â€˜â€˜Introducing the PRRT for the CSG projects would perhaps be the quickest and most effective means of removing the current uncertainty surrounding the proposed tax changes,â€™â€™ Macquarie said.
The report was ostensibly on the outlook for Santos, one of several groups proposing to kick off the Queensland LNG boom. Santos would not comment on the Macquarie report, but said it remained keen to participate in government consultations.
Macquarie said the economics of projects under the PRRT regime would be very similar to those of the existing royalty-based system.
It said CSG projects under PRRT â€˜â€˜would undoubtedly pay more tax than under the current royalty regime, but the tax would be paid later, which limits the impact of net present value and internal rate of return assessmentsâ€™â€™.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"QUEENSLAND is ramping up skills training for the thousands of workers expected to flood into new resources projects.
The state's fledgling liquefied natural gas and coal-seam methane industries -- based around central and northern Queensland -- are expected to require 18,000 skilled workers to fuel the $40 billion projects.
 The government and industry have each contributed $5 million to a workforce development plan to target skills and training for in-demand jobs such as gas operators and instrumentation workers.
Education and Training Minister Geoff Wilson yesterday said an industry-led skills commission would be established to provide oversight of skills training and to align the training with the jobs in demand.
The commission ``will examine economy-wide, across all major industry sectors, what skills are going to be needed for the whole Queensland economy in three to five years'', he said.
A steering committee of representatives from key industries, the Queensland Resources Council, universities and the Australian Industry Group will initially advise the government, with the commission due to be established by the end of this year.
The resources boom is contributing to a forecast drop in unemployment, with the 2011-12 figure tipped to fall to a year-average of 5.25 per cent from a peak of 6.3 per cent last year.
Mackay maintenance co-ordinator Jarrod Lagaluga said industrial skills shortages needed to be addressed, but with additional workers could come additional problems.
``We've got a shortage of trades -- I believe we have for some time,'' said Mr Lagaluga, an experienced boilermaker.
``We can get skilled workers in from all over the country, but we then have accommodation shortages, so that's an issue.''
He said more money should return to the regions, highlighting Mackay's pot-holed roads and traffic snarls.

Queensland's emerging liquefied natural gas sector has embraced initiatives to boost skills levels and streamline regulatory approvals ahead of the state's next resources boom.
 A new industry-led Queensland Skills Commission will drive training and skills reforms to better support industry investment and ensure training programs are properly aligned with the needs of real jobs in industries such as LNG, Treasurer Andrew Fraser said yesterday.
Industry figures such as Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche have been calling for such a commission to overhaul the vocational education and training system to meet the LNG sector's expected huge demand for a range of technical skills.
Australian Industry Group Queensland director Chris Rodwell yesterday described the skills commission as a  critically important Â­decision  for emerging industries such as coal seam gas-based LNG.
Proposed LNG projects in Queensland, involving more than $40 billion in capital expenditure, are expected to create 18,000 direct and indirect jobs. The Queensland Resources Council has estimated the industry will need about 1500 drilling technicians, more than 1000 process plant operators and hundreds of electrical technicians and diesel fitters in just five years.
A $14.6 million commitment to increase numbers of petroleum and gas inspectors should help build up staffing and capacity which has been  under strain  from the demands of both the large-scale LNG projects and smaller players, said Matthew Paull, Queensland director of the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association.
The budget commits the government to individually case-managing the various LNG projects to help smooth procedures, with a single official to be responsible for each venture. It also earmarks $12.5 million over four years to further streamline regulatory approvals processes, $10.5 million to upgrade resource tenure management and $18 million to increase exploration and aid new discoveries.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,2,"West Australian Premier Colin Barnett has threatened to compulsorily acquire land earmarked for a multi-billion-dollar gas development if a dispute between rival native title claimants continues.
Mr Barnett wants an indigenous land-use agreement to be signed by the end of June for the Woodside Petroleum Ltd-led Browse liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing hub at James Price Point, about 60km north of Broome.
 But talks between the Goolarabooloo/Jabirr Jabirr people and the Kimberley Land Council (KLC) have broken down, suggesting Mr Barnett's deadline will not be met.
The KLC said in a statement on Friday it had advised the Traditional Owner Negotiating Committee (TONC) to suspend negotiations with Woodside and the state government while the KLC deals with legal action brought against it by the Goolarabooloo/Jabirr Jabirr people.
 I am both disappointed and sad about today's development,  Mr Barnett told AAP in an interview on Friday.
 There have been good negotiations conducted entirely in good faith, but now there seems to be a very severe division in the claimant groups.
 That makes it very difficult for government.
 We can only deal with a single unified representative group of traditional owners.
 I have, through the heads of agreement that was signed back in April last year (between Woodside, the state government and KLC), allowed time for an indigenous land-use agreement to be reached.
 The deadline for that is the 30th of June, so until we get to that deadline, I remain committed to reaching a final agreement through an ILUA (indigenous land use agreement) by consent, though I would acknowledge that looks unlikely it will be achieved given today's development. 
If an agreement between the native title groups can't be reached, Mr Barnett said Woodside would either have to return to the drawing board or the land would be compulsorily acquired by the state government - a possibility Australia's only Liberal state leader first flagged last year.
 I've never ruled it out,  Mr Barnett said.
 It's not my preferred way.
 But after the Inpex project was lost back in 2008, I have said that I would be prepared to use compulsory acquisition. 
Mr Barnett said most of the details of an ILUA had been agreed upon,  so it would be very disappointing to see this negotiation fail at the last hurdle .
 The smaller group seems to be undoing the process, which is really sad. 
Mr Barnett said the project was set to bring $1.5 billion worth of economic and social improvement to the Kimberley region.
 There has never been an opportunity for Aboriginal people of that scale in Australia's history ... direct payments, direct jobs, direct health, direct education, direct housing ... not just potential benefits. 
Woodside said in an emailed statement to AAP on Friday that the KLC's action was  not unexpected .
 We intend to deliver on our commitments to Kimberley indigenous people as outlined in the heads of agreement struck between Woodside, traditional owners and the state in April 2009,  the energy giant said.

President Alan Garca Prez, several government authorities, political,business and opinion leaders, along with the many Peruvians that work at thePlant, attended the official opening of the Melchorita Plant, located at km.170 of the South Pan American Highway.
The start of operations at Melchorita launches Peru into a new era, onein which the high level of investor confidence and legal and economicstability act as a magnet for mega investment projects. The startup of PERULNG represents the opportunity to continue the current economic growth trendand reassert the country's reputation as a thriving and safe destination forinvestment.
As a result of this project, Peru's gross domestic product expanded 2%during the construction phase (2006-2010) and over 30,000 jobs weregenerated. Looking forward, forecasts predict that the Peruvian State willreceive approximately US$310 million a year due to the Project.
The Melchorita Plant will produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) through apurification and cooling process which will reduce the gas volume by 600times, which facilitates its storage and transport. The plant has a nominalcapacity of 4.4 million tons per year and will process 620 MMcfd of naturalgas.
In addition, at the plant site are the two largest storage tanks in Peru(each stores 130,000 m3 of LNG) and a marine terminal that stretches morethan 1 kilometer long and will receive tankers of 90,000 to 173,000 m3 each.
The Melchorita Plant is the result of a decade of planning anddevelopment, which includes the installation of important pipelineinfrastructure that will also serve the Peruvian market. Thanks to anagreement signed with TGP and recently approved by the Ministry of Energy andMines, the PERU LNG pipeline will provide up to 550 MMcfd of transportcapacity for the Peruvian market, which will clear up the bottleneck of gastransportation to bring more gas to power generation companies, industrialcompanies, vehicles running on natural gas, and Peruvian homes using naturalgas for heat.
The Consortium
Four world-class energy companies form the PERU LNG consortium: Hunt OilCompany of the United States, with a 50% participating interest; SK Energy ofSouth Korea, with a 20% participating interest; Repsol of Spain, also with a20% participating interest; and Marubeni Corporation of Japan, with a 10%participating interest.
This consortium was specifically set up to develop, build, and operatethe PERU LNG Project. Several experienced construction contractors were hiredto make this Project a reality: Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) in charge of theplant's engineering, procurement and construction (EPC); the CDB consortium(Saipem, Jan de Nul and Odebrecht) in charge of the marine terminalengineering, procurement and construction (EPC), and Techint responsible forinstallation of the pipeline. Several Peruvian companies like Graa &Montero, Cosapi, Translei, Minera San Martin, Cosmos, Aceros Arequipa,Tecnicas Metalicas, Esmetal and Sima, among many others, have alsocontributed to the project.
The project received financing of US$2.25 billion in total, whichincludes financing from highly reputed international entities, as well asfinancing from the local Peruvian market. The international financing comesfrom the Inter American Development Bank (IADB), the International FinanceCorporation (IFC) of the World Bank, the Export-Import Bank of the UnitedStates, the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Italian Credit Export CreditAgency (SACE), Socit Gnrale, BBVA, Crdit Agricole-CIB, Sumitomo, ING,Mizuho, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. In addition, a successful US$200million bond offering was made in the local market to secure more capital.Banco de Credito del Peru and Scotiabank Peru provided a US$75 millionworking capital facility and the partner companies made a US$1.6 billioncapital contribution.
Social responsibility
During the construction period (2006-2010), approximately US$20 millionwas invested in social and environmental programs. The highest national andinternational standards were implemented to ensure exemplary performance,demonstrating the project's commitment to respect the environment and localculture in all activities.
More than 20,000 families have benefitted from the range of socialresponsibility programs implemented by PERU LNG. Exemplary programs have beenimplemented as part of this commitment, such as Allin Minkay, which promotesagricultural and livestock competitiveness in the Andean highlands andForPyme, which strengthens small and medium size enterprises in the coastalarea.
In addition, extensive environmental programs have been implemented alongthe entire pipeline area and near the plant. These biodiversity andconservation programs not only meet, but surpass, the highest national andinternational environmental standards.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"The Queensland Government has introduced new controls for the management of water produced in the state's coal seam gas mines.
The water produced from the process is salty, but companies will now be required to treat it so it can be reused in agriculture and manufacturing.
 Acting Climate Change Minister Anastascia Palaszczuk told Parliament companies will also have to dispose of the salt properly.
 The highest and most desirable level in the hierarchy would see brine and solid salt residue chemically processed or treated to create useable products such as soda ash that can be used in other industrial processes,  she said.
 The least desirable outcome and the lowest in the hierarchy is for the brine to be disposed of to an existing all-purpose built regulated waste disposal facility.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Plans for a liquefied natural gas plant in the New South Wales city of Newcastle could provide a lifeline to the stalled Hunter Gas pipeline project.
Hunter Energy's proposed $900 million pipeline project has struggled to secure finance due to the global financial crisis.
 It also suffered a major setback when Queensland Gas scrapped plans for a new gas-fired base load power station in the Hunter Valley.
News that Eastern Star Gas is now conducting a feasability study into an LNG plant in the Port of Newcastle could be just the lifeline that Hunter Energy needs.
Managing director Garbis Simonian says he is keen to talk to Eastern Star about its plans.
 What we need is a long-term contract with a blue chip client to transport gas in order to finance the pipeline,  he said.
Mr Simonian says he is also waiting on the State Government to make a decision on electricity privatisation that would also give certainty to the project.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"MAJOR changes to the Government's proposed resources super tax are specifically aimed at helping coal seam gas projects in Queensland.
This is the key battlefield state where the coming federal election will be won or lost.
 The changes, to be announced today or tomorrow, will go some way to meeting the general objections of the mining industry.
And they might be aimed at splitting the industry so that the Government gets sufficient support to enable it to go to an early election in August.
The core change will be to make the proposed tax more like the existing petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT).
The Government is going to dump the 40 per cent underwriting of losses and lift the threshold profit rate at which the tax kicks in from the long-term bond rate of around 6 per cent to something above 10 per cent.
Crucially, it is going to put coal seam gas projects under the PRRT - theoretically allowing them to compete not only with normal natural gas, but with oil and gas tax regimes internationally.
And it is going to take quarries and gravel out of the tax, to meet fears that the tax would force up the price of building and so actually feed into the cost of ordinary houses. While these changes will blunt some of the attacks - one of the strongest critics, Andrew ``Twiggy'' Forrest', was surprisingly positive and conciliatory yesterday after his meeting with the Prime Minister - they do not address some of the biggest worries of resource groups.
The CEO of BHP Billiton, Marius Kloppers, said late yesterday that a mining version of the PRRT would be ``only slightly less flawed'' than the original proposal.
It would still not address the tax's two big overriding problems, he said.
The first was sovereign risk, that suddenly Australia had become a riskier place in which to invest.
The second, Kloppers said, was simple competitiveness. Companies would switch their exploration efforts and spending to countries with lower tax rates.
A key issue was the way the tax acted retrospectively on existing projects, where much of the cost of developing them had been written off, so the tax impacted even more punitively.
Any proposal that failed to address this - and it does not seem that the Government is proposing to do so - would leave the tax still unacceptable, Kloppers added.
A one-size-fits-all tax also failed to understand how different mineral mining operated under different tax regimes around the world. A bauxite investment here has to compete with another bauxite investment somewhere else; so also for coal and copper and the rest.
While the 40 per cent rate might be reasonable in oil and gas - given OPEC and oil tax elsewhere - it was too high for some minerals.
The industry remains critical of the so-called consultation process, saying that getting a workable tax could only be achieved through proper consultation.
This is echoed by the Opposition, which argues the tax is clearly driven by the twin aims of getting the budget into the black and picking a fight that the Government thought would be electorally popular.
Opposition finance spokesman Andrew Robb said the Coalition would continue to oppose the tax. And he made the point that any dropping of the 40 per cent loss offset would undermine the claim that the tax would boost investment and jobs in mining.
Towards a better deal P47
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Retirement funds have rejected mining industry claims that the federal government's resource tax would hurt superannuation returns, as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sought to Â­regain support by talking up his plan to use some of the proceeds to pay for infrastructure.
The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia predicted that the proposed tax would reduce super returns by less than 1 per cent this year, opening a new division within the business community over the impact of the measure. The move came amid suggestions the federal government was considering a compromise that would exclude quarries and coal-seam gas projects from the tax, while also raising the earnings threshold that would trigger the 40 per cent tax on gross profits.
 Investor groups also expressed doubt about mining company Â­announcements that the proposed tax would shut down projects and lead to job losses, after the corporate regulator reminded executives not to mislead the market on the issue.
Mr Rudd flew to the marginal Queensland mining industry seat of Dawson late yesterday to step up his argument that Queensland and Western Australia would win much of the $6 billion infrastructure outlay to be funded from the tax.
A key critic of the reform, Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest, expressed hope for a negotiated outcome on the tax after meeting the Prime Minister yesterday. And a panel of senior retailers yesterday expressed mixed views about the value and impact of the tax while criticising the implementation process.
But other industry executives said they feared Mr Rudd was going through the motions rather than genuinely considering the substantial changes needed to assuage industry concerns, such as removing the tax on existing projects.
The West Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said after a meeting with Treasury officials:  CCI is disappointed that the government is wanting to consult with business about the tax after it has already made up its mind. 
But the ASFA position debunks a central claim in the mining industry advertising campaign against the resource super profits tax â€“ that ordinary superannuation investors would suffer if the tax was imposed.
 We are trying to say that when you look at the overall percentage of Â­superannuation fund monies invested in the resources sector, it is very small and as such the impact on super funds is minimal,  said ASFA chief executive Pauline Vamos.
 The sky is not about to fall in. ASFA research shows that if the RSPT is introduced, in the form as currently proposed, it could have an impact of less than 1 per cent on the superannuation account balances of the average Australian worker,  the group said in a statement to Â­members.
ASFA has strongly supported the government's move to increase the employer superannuation levy from 9 to 12 per cent by 2020, a reform that is funded in part by the resource tax.
The superannuation industry group stopped short of calling for the super reforms to be delinked from the resource tax, and said it was important to counter the claims put forward by the mining industry in its television advertisements.
Amid rumours that a compromise proposal was imminent, government sources would not confirm any details, but insisted that progress was being made behind the scenes and that the consultation process was constructive.
While some industry figures said they had heard that a compromise would be offered within 48 hours, the government sources said there was a  long way to go  on the matter.
A spokesman for Treasurer Wayne Swan said the government was  determined to implement a profits-based tax which allows us to invest in a stronger economy, but we won't get into a running commentary on the consultation process .
Removing low-value extraction industries such as quarries and lifting the rate of return threshold from the long-term government bond rate of about 6 per cent to a higher level are two of the most requested changes to the government plan.
But a move to remove the nascent coal-seam gas industry â€“ which is mostly based in Queensland so far â€“ would potentially open up a division in the resources sector because the coal-seam gas developers say they are being unfairly treated by comparison with the offshore oil and gas industry.
Offshore gas is covered by the 20-year-old petroleum resource rent tax scheme, which has the same 40 per cent tax rate as the proposed resource super profits tax but a higher threshold, and has been suggested as an Â­alternative model to the RSPT.
While some modest changes to the scheme could blunt the industry criticism of the government for failing to take business concerns into account, the biggest mining companies have made it clear they would not agree to any outcome that retained the essential elements of the tax.
The superannuation industry supported the government tax package when it was launched because it contained a surprise commitment to lift the super guarantee to 12 per cent, but it has not played a significant role in the debate generated by the mining industry opposition.
Australian Shareholders Association chairwoman Helen Dent questioned whether mining company announcements about deferring projects were real decisions because they were not always being declared to the market. That followed a warning from Australian Securities and Investments Commission acting chairman Belinda Gibson that companies should be careful not to mislead the market when making statements about the impact of the tax.
Ian Silk, the chief executive of Â­AustralianSuper, one of the country's biggest retirement schemes, said he was surprised that Mining Council advertisements suggesting that the package of measures announced by the Prime Minister in response to the Henry review of tax â€“ including the mining tax, a cut in the corporate tax rate and an increase in the level of compulsory super contributions to 12 per cent â€“ would be damaging for fund members. He also argued the Â­impact of the tax on mining company share prices was unclear.
 It is very hard to justify the assertion that the package of reforms is bad for members of super funds,  Mr Silk said.
 The tone and quality of the debate on the RSPT has been very poor. It is simplistic and misleading to point to the falls in mining share prices as an indication of the market's discomfort to the mining tax,  he argued, adding that jitters over the pace of economic recovery in the United States, and the European debt crisis, was behind much of the recent sharemarket sell-off.
The chief executive of Queensland-based fund BussQ, David O'Sullivan, argued that much of the criticism of the tax from the mining companies was self-serving.
Mr O'Sullivan said the reforms unveiled in early May were a  reasonable thing for super fund members .

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"LNG: Oil and gas producer Santos could sell one-third of its stake in the Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project to Chinese oil giant Sinopec or others, raising up to $1 billion for project development, according to CLSA analyst Di Brookman.
The move would lessen the need for an equity raising amid the uncertainty over the Kevin Rudd government's controversial resource super-profits tax.
 Yesterday, The Australian revealed that Santos was in talks with China's Sinopec over a stake sale and offtake deal in the $10bn-plus Gladstone LNG project.
Santos owns 60 per cent of the project and Malaysia's Petronas owns the remainder.
Santos chief executive David Knox has said he will be prepared to sell down to below the 51 per cent level he has previously set as a limit, but that he will make sure Santos kept the largest stake.
``If I can attract the right partner, I'm prepared to sell more,'' Mr Knox said recently.
``We will maintain a stake in this project that is larger than Petronas though.''
That would mean the maximum Santos could sell down would be 19.9 per cent, which would leave it with a 40.1 per cent stake.
Ms Brookman said it would be hard for Santos to go to the market with a rights issue when there was so much uncertainty around the RSPT, meaning selling a bigger stake could be a more attractive option.
``Not only are you getting more cash in , you are reducing your share of capital expenditure,'' Ms Brookman said.
Petronas has a pre-emptive right on any portion of the project Santos sells down beyond 50.1 per cent.
The Malaysian energy giant has indicated it is committed to keeping its stake.
If it chose to exercise pre-emptive rights, Santos could sell down a 14.9 per cent stake of the project and remain the largest shareholder.
It is believed Santos executives visited Petronas in Malaysia just before the planned tax was announced, sparking speculation it had been negotiating the sale of a larger stake.
``We believe that before the super-tax hit, Santos were as close as 24 hours away from announcing a buyer of gas from GLNG,'' Ms Brookman said.
Sinopec, Kogas (which has said it has stepped back from negotiations following the RSPT's announcement) and Japan's big electricity and gas producers are seen as potential buyers, she said.
Mr Knox has said the proposed tax had stalled the sale process, and in turn a final investment decision.
Instead of finalising both by the middle of the year, a second-half decision is now the target.
The company says that despite the uncertainty over the RSPT, it is in talks with a number of potential LNG buyers.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"WEST Australian Premier Colin Barnett has threatened to compulsorily acquire land earmarked for a multi-billion-dollar gas development if a dispute between rival native title claimants continues.
Mr Barnett wants an indigenous land-use agreement to be signed by the end of the month for the Woodside Petroleum-led Browse liquefied natural gas processing hub at James Price Point, about 60km north of Broome.
 Talks between the Goolarabooloo-Jabirr Jabirr people and the Kimberley Land Council have broken down, suggesting Mr Barnett's deadline will not be met.
The KLC said yesterday it had advised the Traditional Owner Negotiating Committee to suspend negotiations with Woodside and the state government while the KLC deals with legal action brought against it by the Goolarabooloo-Jabirr Jabirr people.
``I am both disappointed and sad about today's development,'' Mr Barnett said yesterday.
``There have been good negotiations conducted entirely in good faith, but now there seems to be a very severe division in the claimant groups. That makes it very difficult for government.''
If an agreement between the native title groups can't be reached, Mr Barnett said Woodside would either have to return to the drawing board or the land would be compulsorily acquired by the government.
"
GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,2,"AUSTRALIA'S biggest miners, led by BHP Billiton, yesterday began a concerted campaign against a possible new version of the super profits tax they fear could split the broader resources sector.
The Federal Government is understood to be making changes to its proposal that may win the favour of some parts of the industry, including coal-seam gas developers.
 It is believed the changes being considered include making the controversial tax more like the existing Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) by canning a proposed 40 per cent guarantee on losses and lifting the profit trigger for the tax from the long-term bond rate, which is about 6 per cent, to above 10 per cent.
Coal-seam gas projects are likely to be put under the PRRT.
An open letter to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd signed by miners including Rio Tinto, BHP, Newcrest, Xstrata, Barrick, Newmont and Anglo American says any suggestion the petroleum industry tax model is suitable for the minerals industry reflects a `fundamental misunderstanding' of the sector differences.
BHP also stepped up the pressure separately, with the big miner using full-page newspaper advertisements and a letter to shareholders from company chairman Jac Nasser to argue against a PRRT-style tax.
``As I write, there is speculation that the PRRT is a solution. It isn't,'' Mr Nasser wrote.
``Applying the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) model to mineral resources does not address most of the fundamental failings of the proposed super tax.''
Chief executive of Pilbara iron ore miner Atlas Iron, David Flanagan, said there were so many bad things about the current tax proposal `that I suppose I see the move towards a Petroleum Resource Rent Tax as being a positive thing'.
He said a PRRT model would provide a far greater advantage to some companies than to others.
``Now that disparity in advantage isn't fair,'' said Mr Flanagan.
Allowing coal-seam gas players such as Santos to operate under the existing PRRT would be good news for the industry, analysts said.
``I think it would be a huge benefit to the coal-seam gas sector if that was the case,'' said RBS Morgans senior oil and gas analyst Nik Burns.
``Despite what the feeling might be out there, the coal-seam-gas-to-LNG projects on our numbers aren't what we would consider
projects which were generating super profits.''
Macquarie analysts flagged the likely change earlier this week, arguing that the PRRT was `economically preferable' to the super profits tax and the amendment would ensure consistency across the Australian liquefied natural gas space, `letting the market determine the most viable projects rather than government policy'.
But one industry source said transferring projects across to the PRRT was not a simple solution and there would still be complexities involved.
Treasurer Wayne Swan yesterday said the Government would `soon' begin to finalise the tax design, but Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he believed there were still `weeks and probably months' of consultation ahead with the mining companies.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"LNG partners are getting hard to find
Pressure is mounting on Australia's many planned liquefied natural gas ventures to go ahead with their projects or risk missing a market  sweet spot  in 2013-16.
 After approvals for both the giant Gorgon project and Exxon Mobil's Papua New Guinea venture last year, the focus is now on the next two cabs off the rank, Santos's Gladstone venture and BG Group's Queensland project.
The job of those further down the track, including Origin Energy's venture in Queensland with ConocoPhillips, is becoming that much harder, particularly with the resource super profits tax clearly taking a toll among prospective customers. As Deutsche Bank's John Hirjee warns,  the window for greenfield Australian projects not yet sanctioned may be rapidly closing .
With Santos widely seen as the first local player likely to go ahead with a coal seam gas-based LNG project in Queensland, there's growing uneasiness that it has yet to find a buyer for at least a 9 per cent stake in the project it has been hawking around for more than a year.
Santos chief executive officer David Knox has been promising a deal for some months, with both Korea Gas and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation among those declaring their interest. Korea Gas is understood to have been on the verge of signing up before the RSPT came out.
Now the Korean giant is warning that the tax could shape up to be  a main obstacle to conduct CSG-LNG business in Australia , citing a possible loss of project value among factors causing  serious  concern. Sinopec has made it clear Qatar is an option.
Both the Koreans and the Chinese may want a chunkier stake than 9 per cent, which itself would be worth at least $US450 million ($533 million) based on the $US2 billion Malaysia's Petronas stumped up for its 40 per cent interest two years ago.
CLSA reckons Santos will sell up to 19.9 per cent of its stake in the Gladstone project, raising about $1 billion and reducing its share of the estimated $16 billion capital expenditure spend for a two-train project.
Papers now a good deal?
The strong economy and low unemployment rate is not proving a boon to retailers.
As Woolworths chief executive officer Michael Luscombe and Coles managing director Ian McLeod indicated at a forum on Thursday, there's a downturn in retail spending due to lack of fiscal stimulus, recent interest rate rises and consumers not using credit.
In this environment, a concern for media companies is that retailers could curb ad spending in line with low sales growth.
However, the Royal Bank of Scotland believes a recovery in advertising revenue remains on track, despite the signs of broader consumer weakness.
The thinking is that the large pullback in advertising through the global financial crisis was out of proportion with the relatively small downturn in the Australian economy and the market is now recovering to get back in step with broader economic fundamentals.
RBS predicts the ad market will grow by 9.6 per cent this year after contracting 8.3 per cent in 2009 (the largest downturn on record). The fall means there is a low base for a return to growth, particularly for newspapers.
On that basis Fairfax Media (publisher of Weekend AFR), West Australian Newspapers Holdings and APN News & Media could offer great returns. RBS said those stocks are trading on relatively low multiples with only minimal earnings recovery priced in.
Boart compares well
Boart Longyear, the contract driller that floated during the boom and last year undertook one of the larger recapitalisations in the Australian market, is now back in favour.
The global company's US-listed rivals have reported a strong rebound in activity alongside their latest quarterly results, and compared with the likes of peers Major Drilling Group International, Layne Christensen, Atlas Copco and Sandvik, Boart shares look cheap.
Goldman Sachs JBWere says Boart is trading on a calendar year 2010 price-earnings multiple of 14.1, which is below its peers on an average of 18.8.
And only 25 per cent of its exposure is to Australia, and that could be cushioned by an exploration rebate even if the proposed resource super profits tax proceeds in its current form.
Last month Boart upgraded its revenue forecast but left its predicted margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation unchanged at 15 per cent.
However, GSJBW says there is a reasonable chance Boart would upgrade its EBITDA margin guidance to 16 to 17 per cent alongside its half-year results in August. The broker has a  buy  rating on the stock, with a price target of $3.80.
Meanwhile, Credit Suisse Group reaffirms its  outperform  rating on minerals testing group Campbell Brothers, with a price target of $35.80.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Opportunity abounds in Queensland, which now offers more than just a great lifestyle. Story Mark Ludlow
The locals talk of  boom two  in the Bowen Basin, one of Queensland's four great coal reserves. Then there's the potential bonanza from the $50 billion liquified natural gas industry. Not to mention the Bligh government's 20-year $124 billion infrastructure program to build roads, schools and hospitals for the hordes of interstate and overseas migrants. Money begets money.
 Western Australia may have more millionaires per capita than any other state in Australia, but Queensland, with all its promising resource development and strong population growth, is now in the serious market for talent. And the youth of Australia are responding to the opportunities on offer. These days they go north in search of far more than lifestyle.
Brisbane careers and salaries now compete with those of the two biggest Australian cities (Sydney and Melbourne) and offer something that's more elusive there: the freedom to make a very personal mark.
 Queensland does have something going for it â€“ it's a fast-growing economy with opportunities that you would normally see in the developing world,  says former Sydney consultant Chris Rodwell.
 In that way it's fairly pioneering. You are allowed to go after those challenges and you're given some leeway to do it with your own style and approach. 
In 2007, Rodwell moved from Sydney, where he advised some of Australia's blue chip companies after an earlier stint for the Australian Industry Group. His former boss Heather Ridout, who runs the national industry group, offered him the job of state director for the group in Queensland.
 It came completely out of the blue,  Rodwell tells the Weekend AFR. He jumped at it.
For Rodwell, 35, this was an opportunity limited only by how much effort he put into it.
Many others find a career trajectory in Queensland they would never have dreamed of in the congested corporate worlds of Sydney and Melbourne.
Rodwell is a major player in the state, influencing public policy through Ai Group as well as sitting on the Bligh government's jobs task force that is aiming to create a net 100,000 jobs by 2012.
His experience is mirrored by that of hundreds of other young professionals flourishing in the fast-growing Queensland economy. The loss of the state's AAA credit rating and a dip in economic growth last year after the global financial crisis â€“ which hit Queensland's holy trinity of mining, property and tourism in the one year â€“ is seen as a blip as the boom state's economy takes off again.
Population growth is predicted to remain at 2.25 per cent, almost double the national average, for the next four years, and economic growth is due to hit 3.75 per cent in 2010-11, returning to the long-term average of 4.5 per cent the following year.
The next upsurge in the coal boom and the potential bonanza in the LNG industry in south-west Queensland power the resurgence of the two-tier economy where Queensland and WA once again pull away from NSW and Victoria.
The high-rise buildings in the central business district that hug Brisbane's river are full of young professionals willing to take a punt with their careers in Queensland. For most of them it's paying off.
Twenty years ago families moved to Queensland for a better quality of life, which included the fantasy of owning a Queenslander house with a big yard and a pool, bought for a fraction of Sydney's astronomical house prices. Now they chase career opportunities.
With salaries almost comparable to those of southern states, the celebrated lifestyle attractions â€“ owning a four-bedroom house close to town, cheaper childcare and school fees and an enviable climate with only two seasons,  hot  and  warm  â€“ are now just an added bonus.
 There's no doubt career opportunities in Brisbane and Queensland are a quantum leap forward from where they were a generation ago,  says Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser.
 You can see that in the evidence of people no longer leaving to get their first job but staying in Brisbane, as well as the expats who come home to start families in their 30s.
 There are now the same opportunities that exist in Sydney and Melbourne and they get to live in a much more liveable city and a much better climate. 
Fraser, who is Premier Anna Bligh's right-hand man, is pushing through the government's controversial $16 billion privatisation program. He delivered his third budget on Tuesday, at the age of 33.
Born and raised in sleepy Proserpine in far north Queensland before attending university in Brisbane, Fraser is a perfect local example of the sort of opportunity Queensland offers.
 There's no doubt that one of the great untold stories of the resources boom is the people it's drawn to Waterfront Place and the Riverside Centre in Brisbane [two high-rise buildings in the CBD, synonymous with professionals such as lawyers and accountants],  Fraser says.
 LNG is already an industry that's supporting hundreds of jobs in the office towers in Brisbane and has been for the past year or two. 
All the three big LNG players â€“ BG Group, Santos and Origin Energy â€“ have set up offices in Brisbane with up to 800 workers each, drawing lawyers, engineers and communication consultants.
The resources industry accounts for about 12 per cent of business activity in Brisbane, but jobs are also delivered by the infrastructure sector.
The development of the state's fast-growing south-east corner, which is set to grow by another 1 million people over the next 20 years, also attracts the bright stars to the sunshine state.
Laing O'Rourke strategic development executive Joshua Kennedy-White and his girlfriend moved to Brisbane in 2004, tired of the congestion and high prices of Sydney.
Kennedy-White started work as a consultant in Brisbane but quickly moved to a two-year stint in the coordinator-general's office in the Queensland government as it began to introduce a 20-year infrastructure program.
Now working for Laing O'Rourke, which has projects across the state, Kennedy-White says the career opportunities in Brisbane in the past six years outshine anything in Sydney.
 Absolutely, for the simple reason you can get your head around this place,  he says.
 In Sydney, you've got to be part of the 'establishment'. If you didn't go to Knox [Grammar School], it's hard to break in.
 Up here you can do whatever you want to do. There are so many projects and there's so much demand. 
Kennedy-White says many of his contemporaries in Sydney find their careers stalled because of lack of opportunities.
 Sydney's a big city,  he says.  It's hard to get in and once you get there you're stuck at that next level.
 Brisbane is rapidly growing and it needs people â€“ and talented people. 
Kennedy-White, who declares Brisbane's lifestyle  amazing , says he has no regrets about the move north.
That old disincentive of lower salaries no longer applies.
Five years ago Brisbane had the climate and the cheaper housing, but not the big bucks on offer in Sydney and Melbourne.
That's changing, with mid-ranking executive salaries only about 15 per cent lower than those of Sydney which is only marginal considering it might cost you another $1 million to find an equivalent house in the harbour city to match your four-bedroom house in the inner-city Brisbane suburbs of Paddington or Bardon.
There may not be the same number of head offices as in the southern capitals but the chief executive salaries in Brisbane are on par with Sydney or Melbourne's and senior executive salaries in the Queensland branches of the big law and accounting firms are not far from those of Sydney counterparts.
Mark Wilson, director of Northern Recruitment, which specialises in executive positions, says Brisbane salaries have increased by up to 50 per cent in the past five years.
Base salaries of $200,000 to $300,000 are the norm, with the opportunity to double that with short- and long-term incentives.
Wilson says that as in Sydney and Melbourne, some executive positions have been hit hard by the financial crisis, especially the loss of incentive payments.  But I think the medium- to long-term outlook is still strong because of growth,  he says.
Amid a slump in the property and construction sector in Brisbane, the Bligh government has stepped in with a $17 billion infrastructure budget in 2010-11 to keep the economy ticking along.
Even in the slow recovery from the economic downturn, big salaries are being stumped up.
State coordinator-general Colin Jensen, who gives the green light to big capital works projects, resigned during the week. He's going to take a $420,000-a-year base salary (which could reach $600,000 with bonuses) running Brisbane City Council. That's about double what the Premier earns.
Regional centres such as Mackay, the mining services hub for the Bowen Basin coal mines, and Gladstone, the gateway for the $50 billion LNG boom, have dodged the global financial crisis.
The demand for mining-related roles such as engineers remains  incredibly bullish , according to Wilson.
 They have not experienced a downturn,  he says.  Anything to do with infrastructure, water and energy is very strong. 
The flipside of the strong growth is the rising cost of living.
A local trying out Matt Moran's relatively new ARIA restaurant in Brisbane almost choked on his dessert when he saw he'd been charged $7.50 for a long black.
But the higher prices are now accepted as the price of growth.
The thriving arts precinct in South Brisbane, including the award-winning Gallery of Modern Art, has impressed new arrivals who worried about a lack of culture in Brisbane, a city whose long-standing highlight on Australia Day remains cockroach races at the Story Bridge Hotel.
Brisbane and Queensland are changing for the better and this transformation is fuelled by southerners seeking to boost their careers by moving north.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,2,"MARK COLVIN: Negotiations over a proposed Liquefied Natural Gas plant north of Broome are in disarray after local indigenous people pulled out of the process.
The $30 billion project to exploit gas reserves in the Browse Basin off the Kimberley coast is now in jeopardy.
 The joint venture partners led by Woodside had hoped for a positive result by the end of this month.
Western Australia's Premier says an Indigenous Land Use Agreement has largely been completed.
But now the State Government says it may have to follow through on threats of compulsory acquisition of the land at James Price Point.
David Weber reports from Broome.
DAVID WEBER: The Kimberley Land Council Director Wayne Bergmann has said complex legal issues about land ownership meant the KLC had to stop negotiating.
WAYNE BERGMANN: Look the Kimberley Land Council has suspended negotiations with the state and Woodside over the proposed LNG development at James Price Point.
DAVID WEBER: Friday's announcement was not entirely unexpected. The Indigenous people involved in a native title claim formally split into two groups in April.
The Jabirr Jabirr people wanted to continue negotiations over James Price Point and the promised benefits said to total more than $1.5 billion.
But the Goolarabooloo people led by Joseph Roe are against to the development.
The split is the main problem, as Wayne Bergmann explained.
WAYNE BERGMANN: Put simply, until the native title issues are resolved it is inappropriate for the land council to formally engage on behalf of Goolarabooloo and Jabirr Jabirr.
DAVID WEBER: There've been suggestions that it could be years before separate native title claims are resolved.
The WA Premier Colin Barnett has indicated he's not prepared to wait that long.
He's threatened to use legislation for compulsory acquisition of the land.
Broome Shire President Graeme Campbell says he hopes it doesn't come to that.
GRAEME CAMPBELL: I see this as an opportunity for them to get funds that otherwise have not flowed through to them by Federal or state governments.
I'm a little concerned that maybe both of those bodies will shift their responsibility and say 'Well oil and gas you can pay for this'. But my philosophy is that there does need to be more education, more job opportunity, more health - all of the issues - and this is an issue for Indigenous people that I believe as the KLC has tried to do, to spread that across the range of Indigenous communities.
Now I'm not going to buy into the situation of traditional owners and the ownership issue there. It's something that the shire is not involved in and will stay out of but just as a comment, I think the benefits will outweigh some of the detracting factors.
DAVID WEBER: Obviously it'll be up to the courts to sort out if the Goolarabooloo and the Jabirr Jabirr pursue separate claims but if it is up to the courts that could take years.
GRAEME CAMPBELL: That certainly could take years. I think that combined claim was about 13 years in the making as it was. And when you look at the Yaru claim in Broome, that was nearly 16 years coming to fruition and through some good work and good will on behalf of everybody we managed to achieve that which will give great benefits for Broome.
The thing that worries me is that, does the state or the federal government then say 'Well look this project has to go ahead and we'll just take the land'?
DAVID WEBER: If there was to be compulsory acquisition what you're saying is the amount of money that's available now from the joint venture partners might not be available from the governments?
GRAEME CAMPBELL: Well, you've got to look at compulsory acquisitions and what they do then is value the land that they're acquiring at dollar values and that. And the real risk is there if you just did it on that basis - not future benefit and not future earning capacity - the pay-out to the owners could be significantly less and that worries me.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"There will be a seminar about how coal seam gas water extraction is impacting the Great Artesian Basin in Dalby on Thursday .
Hosted by the Basin Sustainability Alliance, the seminar will feature groundwater engineer and researcher Colin Hazel speaking about the occurrence of coal and coal seam gas in the Great Artesian Basin and the possible impacts of gas extraction and inter-aquifer transfer of water.
 Mr Hazel, who is a lecturer at the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, will offer insight into how groundwater is stored and how it moves, and will discuss key issues surrounding the management of the Basin.
Basin Sustainability Alliance Chairman Mr Ian Hayllor is encouraging all members of the community to attend.
â€œWhen an oil spill threatens our Great Barrier Reef the entire nation is mortified, but we are experiencing daily threats to another important natural resource - the Great Artesian Basin - and it's going under the radar for many people,â€? Mr Hayllor said.
The seminar begins at 9am at the Dalby RSL on Thursday.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"State-owned energy company PetroVietnam is shaping up as a potential major buyer of Australian liquefied natural gas, with the company visiting several Australian LNG companies earlier this year.
Dwindling domestic coal reserves and an expanding economy has Vietnam and nearby Thailand looking increasingly to Australia for energy supplies, including LNG and coal.
 Austrade's Kuala Lumpur-based trade commissioner Paul Martin told The Australian Financial Review that companies from both countries were in negotiations with Australian energy companies over potential sources of supply.
PetroVietnam is particularly interested in securing LNG imports. Representatives of the company visited Australia recently for discussions with a range of Australian LNG producers and developers.
 We know that a number of the Vietnamese and Thai companies are in discussions with Australian companies about the potential to partner, the potential to source, and they're really looking at 10-plus-year strategies,  Mr Martin said.
He said Vietnam was targeting  easily over $1 billion  in energy exports from Australia to Vietnam by 2015, with the potential for that figure to double to $2 billion by 2020.  It's the sort of figure that can really change the trading relationship and really put Vietnam on the map for a lot of companies. 
As well as committing to offtake contracts, he said, companies from both countries were willing to take direct equity stakes in energy projects.
The emergence of new LNG buyers from Vietnam and Thailand comes at a crucial time for several Australian LNG hopefuls. Adelaide-based Santos and Sydney's Origin Energy are both looking for buyers of LNG from their proposed Queensland LNG projects.
Santos is known to be in discussions with Korea Gas and China's Sinopec, as well as a variety of Japanese buyers, over offtake from its Gladstone LNG project. It is believed to have been on the cusp of securing a deal with Kogas, but negotiations were stalled after the Australian government announced its proposed resource super profits tax.
Santos's partner at Gladstone, Malaysian state-owned giant Petronas, had already agreed to buy the output from the project's first LNG train, or processing line, but Santos needs to snare another customer in order to justify a more robust two-train development.
Origin is slightly behind, and had been hoping to secure its first customers by the end of the year.
Emerging markets such as Vietnam and Thailand â€“ neither of which currently import LNG â€“ look increasingly likely to play important roles in buying Australian LNG. Demand out of Japan, by far the world's largest LNG buyer, is stagnating, and Chinese demand, while growing, is also increasingly likely to be met by domestic supply and pipeline gas from Russia.
Mr Martin said it was  highly likely  a deal would be done between Australian LNG companies and Vietnam.
 We've been working on this for some time, we've been facilitating visits by the government, by companies to Australia over the last six months and will continue to do so,  he said.
 We're working on co-operation agreements in a whole range of areas, and we're very confident over the next 12-to-18 months of deals coming to fruition.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"The future of a multi-billion dollar coal seam gas project in central Queensland remains undecided despite high level talks about the super profits tax in Canberra.
The British Gas (BG) owned company, QGC, which is behind the liquefied natural gas (LNG) project at Curtis Island near Gladstone, is considering the implications of the super profits tax on the plant.
 BG representatives met with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson yesterday.
Mr Ferguson says the talks were  productive  and  responsible .
 There will be a resource super profits tax in Australia but at the same time we'll reach a balance which ensures investment and jobs such as the British Gas project,  he said.
Mr Ferguson says the project could potentially generate 5,000 jobs during construction and 700 during operations.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"PRIME Infrastructure will incur a sizeable drop in revenue from one of its last remaining big investments after the federal energy regulator in the US pushed through a new charging regime for one of the country's main gas supply pipelines.
Cuts in the prices being charged by the Natural Gas Pipeline Company will be staggered from November 1 this year, with the first round involving a reduction of 3 per cent.
 That will be followed by a 2 per cent fall from April 1 next year and a final cut of 3 per cent â€” making 8 per cent in all â€” from July 1, 2011.
Prime, which was previously known as Babcock & Brown Infrastructure, holds a 26.4 per cent stake in NGPL as part of a consortium of investors.
The pipeline company is a leading supplier of gas to Chicago.
Yesterday's announcement was the culmination of a seven-month review of NGPL's pricing structure by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had begun court action in an attempt to force costs down.
It was the first such move that the commission had made since 1996.
A preliminary agreement â€” first mooted at the end of April â€” prompted another of NGPL's minority shareholders, the US energy group Kinder Morgan, to cut the value of its investment by $US430 million as a consequence of the expected fall in revenue.
Prime made no mention in a statement to the ASX yesterday of having to follow suit by taking a similar impairment charge, constraining itself to saying that the new pricing regime would have no effect on its 2010 full-year earnings forecast for NGPL.
In an announcement to investors last month responding to Kinder Morgan's decision, Prime stated that its fellow shareholder's calculations did not take into account the way Prime's investment in NGPL was structured, its tax position or its own value of the business.
The full impact of the new pricing regime changes will be felt by Prime in the 2012 calendar year. However, it gave no details of what the impact would be on the revenue it receives from NGPL.
Analysts have previously estimated that the pricing agreement could shave as much as $US150 million ($A175 million) from the gas company's service charges.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE Rudd government is considering modifying the resource super-profits tax for the burgeoning coal-seam gas industry and changing the rules on the 40 per cent tax for different minerals -- the first sign of compromise in its damaging battle with miners.
As Kevin Rudd moved to shore up his leadership among his concerned Labor colleagues in Canberra yesterday, the government moved closer to negotiating a separate deal with the coal-seam gas industry, which is promising to develop a vast new industry in Queensland.
 Other concessions emerging from within the government's negotiations are a recognition that the quarry industry supplying building materials and superphosphate for farming should not attract the same tax as high-value minerals, and offshore and onshore gas fields would be treated in the same way.
In a crucial move to appease the mining industry and seek an early settlement of the politically draining dispute, Resources Minister Martin Ferguson told the ALP caucus yesterday that when it came to the tax ``one size doesn't necessarily fit all''.
The miners have demanded different treatment for different industries and minerals as one of their key claims, instead of the government's proposed uniform application of the 40 per cent tax across all industries and minerals.
Under pressure for failing to consult the mining industry before announcing the $12 billion tax and facing calls to settle the tax by August, the Prime Minister said yesterday he was handling the negotiations with the mining industry and told Labor MPs it was better to ``get it right'' than meet a deadline.
Under the changes being mooted, the new ``greenfields'' industry of coal-seam gas and offshore gas and petroleum projects would be treated equally, the low-value industries such as quarrying would be largely exempt and all other minerals would be in a third category. But all would fall under the same tax umbrella.
Mr Rudd and Mr Ferguson welcomed comforting words from coal-seam gas miner BG group's head of Australian operations, Catherine Tanna, after she met the Prime Minister in Canberra to discuss the Queensland Curtis LNG project at Gladstone and the RSPT.

There was no move against the Prime Minister, with a caucus spokesman describing the mood of the room as one of ``steely determination'' to back Mr Rudd's reform push and not be spooked by political pressure.
Labor sources have made clear that Mr Rudd's real test comes in a week with the publication of the next major opinion survey -- the Newspoll to be published in The Australian next week.
One senior source said that with cabinet solidly behind Mr Rudd and his deputy Julia Gillard remaining loyal, it would take a ``shocker of a result'' to shift Mr Rudd's support.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"QUEENSLAND coal-seam gas miner the BG Group claims to have had ``productive'' discussions with the federal government about the proposed resource super-profits tax.
But the company is still no closer to making a final decision on whether or not it will go ahead with its $15 billion project at Gladstone.
 BG Group's Australian boss, Catherine Tanna, met Kevin Rudd, Wayne Swan and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson yesterday for talks about the impact of the tax on BG's proposed liquefied natural gas project at the industrial-port city.
Although the meeting in Canberra provided a photo opportunity, the only comment was in the form of a statement from Ms Tanna.
``The Prime Minister and I discussed the Queensland Curtis LNG project, which is being developed under the existing Queensland royalty regime, but which may be subject to a federal resource profits tax,'' she said.
The company refused to comment on speculation that the federal government is considering removing the LNG industry from the resource super-profits tax and instead placing it under the existing petroleum resources rent tax regime, which generally applies to offshore oil and gas projects.
This would still allow the government to levy a 40 per cent rent tax but would give the projects some certainty, which is especially important in the current context.
The proposed LNG industry is crucial to Queensland's medium-term development because coal exports are predicted to flatten out over the next few years and LNG will provide a new source of employment and income.
BG is vying with South Australian-based Santos to be the first to build an LNG plant in Gladstone, but Santos has slipped ahead by gaining its environmental approvals from the Queensland government.
But uncertainty about the resource super-profits tax has caused Santos to push back its time frame for a final investment decision to the end of the year, and BG is believed to be close to getting its environmental approvals.
Another major LNG proponent, Origin Energy, has indicated that uncertainty about the proposed tax could also delay its plans on making a final investment decision.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Prime Infrastructure Holdings has reached a settlement on its key gas pipeline asset in the United States that analysts say clears some of the uncertainty surrounding Prime.
The settlement with customers and staff at a key US regulator outlines a plan for a phased reduction in the service charges for customers of Prime's 26.4 per cent-owned Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America.
 The new charges start on July 1.
Prime said the Natural Gas Pipeline Company and the parties it had settled with wouldn't seek to change the rates agreed before April 2016. As part of the settlement, the pipeline business will reduce the amount it charges for transporting and storing gas.
 The disclosure resolves the biggest issues facing the company and one that has been a drag on PIH's [Prime's] share price since the recapitalisation late last year,  said analysts at Merrill Lynch.
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil across different states, had argued the pipeline business was making too much money.
FERC claimed the business was making a higher rate of return than it deemed appropriate, both from transporting and storing gas.
The pipeline business is one of the biggest natural gas transmission and storage systems in the US.
FERC also said it would look into the amount of money the business was making from gas it used in its system as part of the process of gas transportation.
The US regulator's statements came just as Prime was finalising a deal that incorporated an equity fund raising and a corporate restructuring. The uncertainty surrounding the regulatory issue has weighed on the company's share price ever since.
In response to the regulator, Prime produced a study that argued it had been underpaid for the services it was providing to its customers.
The settlement must be approved by an administrative law judge and the commissioners at FERC. Prime expects a result in the third quarter of this year.
Prime said the settlement wouldn't affect its forecast for the year to June 30 of $220 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from the Natural Gas Pipeline business.
Analysts regard the change as positive for Prime in that it removes uncertainty.
Merrill Lynch calculates the earnings impact could be a reduction on EBITDA at the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of some $US40 million ($48 million) in 2010, rising to $US120 million in 2012 and remaining at that level thereafter. They had originally forecast a $US160 million impact in 2012 and subsequent years.
Merrill Lynch increased its valuation on Prime's shares, but maintained its neutral rating. The broker values Prime at $4.27, up from $4.03.
Merrill Lynch noted Prime is still involved in two tax disputes: at its 100Â per cent-owned WestNet Rail business; and at the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, in which it has a 50.1 per cent interest until September 2051 and is a 100Â per cent leaseholder.
Prime has been trying to recover $46.4 million at WestNet and $70 million at Dalrymple Bay. It also hopes to avoid incurring an additional $74 million at Dalrymple Bay.
 The outcomes relating to the two disputes are not expected for some time and may continue to provide an element of uncertainty around PIH's share price,  Merrill Lynch said.
Prime's shares closed at $3.75 yesterday, down 1.3 per cent amid a broadly flat market. The ASX/S&P 200 Index closed down 0.01 per cent at 4505.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"A petroleum resource rent tax would be a compromise at best, writes Paul Garvey.
The adoption of a petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) may not be enough to ensure a rapid resumption in the development of Queensland's emerging coal seam gas sector, industry participants warn.
 The head of BG Group in Australia, Catherine Tanna, met Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday to discuss the potential impact of the government's proposed resource super profits tax (RSPT) on coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects such as that planned by BG for central Queensland.
While Ms Tanna would only say that the discussions had been productive, there have been suggestions a PRRT compromise could be in the works.
But coal seam gas industry sources said the tax could still create problems for the proposed projects.  It's not necessarily the instant panacea it's being made out to be,  one source said.
Tens of billions of dollars in coal seam gas investment have already been stalled as a result of uncertainty over the tax.
A PRRT such as that which already applies to offshore oil and gas production would ensure the coal seam gas-fed LNG plants proposed for development in Queensland are subject to the same tax regime as most of the offshore-fed LNG projects of Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
A PRRT-style tax would also allow companies to recoup their full capital costs before they had to pay the 40 per cent tax, as opposed to the RSPT, where companies would have to depreciate their upfront capital costs over the life of the project, meaning an immediate start to tax payments.
Wilson HTM analyst John Young has modelled the impact of the RSPT and the PRRT on Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina's proposed Curtis Island LNG project. He found the project's net asset value would drop by 16 per cent with the introduction of the RSPT, and 9Â per cent under a PRRT.
 The PRRT is less onerous than the RSPT, but it is still a significant step down from the current regime,  Mr Young said.
But his projected internal rate of return for coal seam gas-to-LNG projects would only drop from 21 per cent to 19 per cent under the RSPT, he said.
 On that basis, you'd say it's still an attractive project. It's not catastrophic from that point of view,  Mr Young said.
To date, both Santos and Origin Energy have delayed final investment decisions on their LNG projects, in part due to uncertainty surrounding the new tax.
Santos chief executive David Knox said last week the proposed tax changes had hindered the company's efforts to secure customers for, and an equity investor in, its Gladstone LNG project.
BG plans to consider a final investment decision for its project later this year, once environmental approvals have been secured.
CLSA energy analyst Di Brookman said that while the RSPT in its proposed form would leave Santos's Gladstone LNG project  marginal at best , she was confident the PRRT would be the ideal solution.
 Optimally for the government, it gets to keep its 40 per cent tax rate, which is after all the key point the general public is likely to digest, but with uplift rates above the long-term bond rate for exploration and development capital expenditure, project economics will not be hit as hard and the tax would be genuinely levied at 'super-profits',  Ms Brookman said.
She said a rapid resolution of the tax issue could pave the way for final investment decisions on the LNG projects of both Santos and BG before the federal election.
 A couple of high-profile LNG final investment decisions and the fiscal stimulus that goes with these mega projects could be just the tonic for the government,  Ms Brookman said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,2,"THREE mining executives left Canberra empty-handed yesterday, all but confirming the Rudd government will enter the federal election at war with the nation's biggest minerals giants over the proposed resources super profits tax.
While the government has embarked on a process of soothing the concerns of the smaller coal-seam gas and sand-and-gravel sectors, there is virtually no progress being made with the bigger companies, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata.
 As the industry lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, launched a fresh salvo of anti-tax advertisements yesterday, the government girded itself for what could be an embarrassing Senate hearing today into its decision to spend $38 million on advertisements supporting the tax.
The government exempted itself from its own guidelines which required taxpayer-funded ads to be vetted to ensure they were not political, inviting widespread condemnation.
Today the committee will question the federal Auditor-General, Ian McPhee, who was removed from the vetting role in March, and the man who replaced him, the former public servant Allan Hawke. The government says the ads are justified to counter what it says is a campaign worth more than $100 million being run by the minerals sector.
The chief executive of BHP, Marius Kloppers, Rio's managing director, David Peever, and the chief executive of Xstrata Coal, Peter Freyberg, yesterday jointly met the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and the Resources Minister, Martin Ferguson.
Despite his recently stated intention to adopt a more hands-on approach to negotiations, the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, did not attend. Later, the three miners released a statement saying the government was not even prepared to address their three key concerns. The companies oppose the application of the tax to existing projects and believe different commodities should be taxed at different rates.
For example, BHP's phosphate operations compete with operations in the US and Morocco whereas its titanium operations compete with mines in Indonesia and China.
Taxing super profits on all minerals in Australia at 40 per cent would not reflect the varying levels of competition from international rivals, they argue.
The companies also sought an assurance yesterday that if an agreement were ever reached on a profits-based tax, there would be no further tax changes concerning either existing or future projects without adequate consultation beforehand.
Mr Ferguson and Mr Rudd again ruled out changing the rate of 40 per cent.
Although there is little chance of an agreement with the minerals companies, the government hopes to take some heat out of the debate by making agreements with other sectors by tailoring transitional arrangements to suit each sector and, in some cases, individual companies.
Mr Rudd said the government was listening to the coal-seam gas and sand-and-gravel sectors but cautioned that not everyone may get what they want.
 Whether we respond positively is a separate matter,  he said. Mr Swan likened the tax - which will fund company tax cuts, infrastructure and superannuation - to the signature reforms of the Hawke-Keating and Howard governments.
 Had previous governments put sectoral interests ahead of the national interest, we would never have floated the dollar or pulled down tariff walls, or introduced compulsory superannuation,  he said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,2,"TAXATION
ONE of Australia's top mining executives says his company may be prepared to pay a 40 per cent tax on profits from its coal-seam gas project, but only if it were applied like the decades-old petroleum resource rent tax.
 The chairman of Santos, Peter Coates, said the proposed resources super profits tax was a  dog's breakfast  dreamed up by  theoretical economists  that could not be applied in a one-size-fits-all way.
But Mr Coates offered a way forward, saying if the government dumped the resources super tax and extended the petroleum rent tax to onshore coal-seam gas projects, Santos would look more favourably on the proposal for its $10 billion coal-seam gas project in Gladstone, Queensland.
 It seems to me commonsense that the onshore petroleum industry should operate on the same basis as the offshore petroleum industry,  Mr Coates said.
 Provided we had a level playing field, provided we were not doubling up in terms of paying state royalties on top of a [petroleum rent tax] and provided all those things were taken into account and the cash flows were consistent to allow the business model, then I'm sure we would be quite satisfied. 
The 40 per cent petroleum rent tax is paid on profits above a 15 per cent threshold for offshore petroleum projects; the 40 per cent resource super profits tax would be paid on profits above 6 per cent.
Mr Coates's comments confirm that any meaningful progress in the argument over the mining tax would require wholesale change to its design and came as the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, said the government would consider carve-out deals for certain sections of the resources sector.
 It's quite plain we will be considering with different parts of the industry their respective requests for transitions arrangements which may be particular to their industries,  Mr Rudd said.
But yesterday the Resources Minister, Martin Ferguson, ruled out applying different tax rates, saying the  headline  rate would remain.
Mr Coates, who is also chairman of the WA nickel miner Minara, said the government had to urgently reconsider the 40 per cent rate as it would apply to the minerals sector.
The 40 per cent resources tax was designed for the petroleum industry, he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"RESOURCES ROW
The value of Arrow Energy's coal seam gas assets could be slashed by 70 per cent under the resource super profits tax accounting rules, underlining why the sector is locked in serious discussions with the government over transition arrangements.
 Resources Minister Martin Ferguson hinted yesterday the government could move to allay the coal seam gas industry's concerns, including ensuring the taxing point for projects was close to the well head, where methane gas is valued at about $3.50 a gigajoule, compared with about $12 on world markets after being processed into liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina have bid $3.45 billion for Arrow Energy, but the book value of the assets carried into the resource tax would only be about $1 billion, according to accountants familiar with the company's accounts.
Other leading players in emerging coal seam gas-fed LNG projects in central Queensland, including BG Group, Origin Energy and Santos, face similar problems with shifting recently acquired projects into the resource tax regime at book values.
Sources close to the coal seam gas sector, which has $50 billion worth of projects on the drawing board in Queensland, said the issue was a key concern raised by companies in their talks with Mr Ferguson.
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Mr Ferguson all spoke of ensuring  generous  transition arrangements yesterday. The Resources Minister singled out the coal seam gas sector as being of particular interest.
The suggestion raised industry hopes that projects forced into the resource tax would be recognised at closer to market value, to take into account the value of potential reserves.
Under the current proposal, the book value would only take into Â­account mine development and improvement costs, not acquisition Â­expenses.
Coal seam gas players have not undertaken a large amount of mine expenditure, because the industry is only finding its feet, as strong demand from Asia drives up LNG prices to make projects economically viable.
Companies want the costs of acquisitions, of which there have been many in recent years, to form part of their capital base.
In effect, the government would acquire its 40 per cent share in projects at a higher price, defer tax to later in the project's life and allow more generous depreciation claims.
The government wants to tax commodities as close as possible to the well head or mine gate, to ensure only the value of the natural resource is taxed â€“ not the added value through processing and refinement.
However, because no saleable price exists before the coal seams are fractured and the gas pumped by water to the surface and piped to Curtis Island to be converted to LNG, it will be difficult to ascertain a market or arms-length value of the raw resource.
A  net back  rule used for the petroleum resource rent tax to discount the value-add component has been mooted by Treasury.
There is disagreement between Treasury and the industry over how much value is added in the processing and refining stages.
Resources and energy companies are also concerned that more efficient and cost-effective refinement would be penalised under the net-back Â­approach. A final decision has not been made for any of the $50 billion gas projects planned for Queensland's Surat Â­Basin.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Farmers and environmentalists are joining forces on Queensland's Darling Downs to try to stop the rush for natural gas.
The Darling Downs is one of Australia's most productive farming regions, but it is being overrun with drilling rigs as some of the world's biggest energy companies try to bank a new resource bonanza - millions of tonnes of methane from coal.
 The farmers are now worried that thousands of gas wells are going to damage their ability to grow food.
 I think the coal seam gas companies are where we were 100 years ago; come in and rape and pillage, grab what you can and leave,  Dalby farmer Ian Hayllor said.
 We're not going to let them do that - they're going to have to be sustainable.
 If they want to work in our environment, they've got to be sustainable.
 They can come in, take the gas, but they're not going to destroy the environment they're working in.
 If they can leave it the way they found it, we'll accept them onto our properties. 
The anger of farmers is mounting as the gas companies begin a push into some of the more productive cropping areas of the Darling Downs.
Rural consultant George Houen, who represents some of the 200 to 300 farmers who expect to have gas wells or pipelines on their properties, says mining has always been an activity which directly affected only a small number of landholders at any single time.
 There hasn't often been this kind of uprising before,  he said.
 Now, suddenly, you've got this enormous, tremendously increased level of activity and of intruding into properties on a scale never before seen. 
Beneath the Darling Downs is the Great Artesian Basin and seams of Jurassic-age coal that happen to be full of methane.
To release the gas, the coal has to be fractured and the water that is in it, pumped to the surface.
That water is salty and for the time being it is dumped, by the millions of litres, in large evaporation ponds.
The farmers are worried about where all that salt is going to go.
They are also worried that fresh water from their bores will pour into the coal seams, lowering the water level or that chemicals in the coal, when it is fractured, will poison their water or leach into the Great Artesian Basin.
Veteran environmental campaigner Drew Hutton, who has joined the farmers in trying to get a moratorium on the gas well drilling, says until some of these questions are answered, this is one of the biggest issues in the country today.
 It's not only an issue for farmers, it's not just simply about farmers are getting pushed around, getting a bit of a raw deal,  he said.
 The potential impacts on the Great Artesian Basin from this uncontrolled this experiment that they're unleashing on the Darling Downs makes it one of the great environmental issues of our time. 
But the gas companies dispute the links between their wells, the water in coal seams and the water held in vast aquifers beneath the Darling Downs.
No-one quite knows yet how the aquifers might interact.
The Queensland Government is working on a model of this underground water system and wants to use it to make the gas companies produce  groundwater impact reports .
Matthew Paull, the Queensland director of the the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association representing the gas companies, says he understands the concerns that landowners have.
 We will be open about the impact we're having if any on their aquifers,  he said.
 If there is an impact, there are laws in place that companies need to make good so that could be drilling them a new bore providing them with another source of water or paying compensation. 
The rush for natural gas is increasing as the world becomes more carbon conscious.
If and when carbon trading arrives, it is likely that natural gas, or methane, will become a more attractive fuel than coal, for generating electricity.
Energy analyst and researcher at the University of Queensland, Dr Liam Wagner says once there is certainty on the price of carbon, then more of the natural gas-fired generation will be installed.
 You'll see that, for instance, the government-owned corporations that generate electricity in Queensland, they will start to retire some of their older and dirtier power stations because they will become less competitive in the national market,  he said.
The world's hunger for electricity appears insatiable.
Even China, which does not import much natural gas at the moment, is gearing up for imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Australia has half a dozen LNG exporting plants on its books and the Chinese are building half a dozen LNG receiving plants along its coastline.
The questions is: how closely will Australia's LNG future now be linked to China?
Adi Karev, the head of global oil and gas for consultant Deloitte and Touche, says it is an interesting question.
 I think that it's not just Australia needs China; it's China needs Australia,  he said.
 If you look at the balancing mix of increasing the amount of gas in their portfolio from 4 per cent to 10 per cent by 2020, to a very large degree that depends on the ability to get into a counter party agreements with stable close proximity predictable supply capable countries and companies, and Australia represents that. 
Most of Australia's natural gas is being produced from offshore fields, especially the big gas reserves off the West Australian coast.
But coal seam gas if big and getting bigger and the farmers protests are getting louder, and more political.
Farmer Ian Hayllor says he can see where the  green moment  was coming from.
 We're actually working a lot closer together,  he said.
He also says an alliance with the Australian Greens Party is not out of the question either.
 If they come up with the right policies and are prepared to really back the sustainability of this area, ensure it's got a future, ensure it's there for our children, maybe we will start looking at backing the Greens, because at the moment we're not getting heard too well by the existing parties,  Mr Hayllor said.Listen to Gas Rush on Background Briefing, ABC Radio National, Sunday June 20 - 9.10am, Tuesday June 22 -7.05pm and Wednesday June 23 - 4.05am.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"A BRITISH-based manufacturer of pipe fittings and machinery looking to tap into Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas industry has moved into Brisbane's east.
Fusion Plast has taken a two-year lease on a 2000sq m warehouse at 62 Trade
 St, Lytton.
The deal with a two-year option was negotiated by David Knox, of King & Co, and struck at a net rental rate of $210,000 a year.
Mr Knox said the warehouse was part of a larger building on a 1.72ha site owned and occupied by Cahill Transport.
``The space was surplus to their needs,'' he said.
``(Fusion Plast) wanted a central location close to the Port with good access to major arterials.
``So it suited them perfectly.''
The property also features a 15m awning, 25sq m of office space, electric security fencing and reinforced concrete hardstand, allowing storage of full containers both inside and outside.
Fusion Plast's Australian general manager Mike Raine said the expansion into Queensland would enhance the company's operations from its existing facility in Adelaide. ``Geographically, we needed another warehouse to enable us to cover the eastern seaboard,'' he said.
``But Queensland is also a place that is still growing and quite vibrant and we're looking to get on the back of that.
``We supply a lot of fittings to the mining sector and we plan to be involved with the large coal seam gas extraction plants.''
Mr Raine said Fusion Plast had looked at about 40 properties from the Gold Coast to Eagle Farm before deciding on the Lytton warehouse.
``Ninety per cent of our product is brought in from Europe in containers,'' he said.
``A number of the properties we looked at would have fitted the bill quite well but what snagged it for us was the location.
``Not only was it close to the airport, the port, the motorways and within half an hour of the CBD but we also share the yard with a freight company.
``That was a major positive for us logistically and financially and it enables us to service our customers immediately.''

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Resources company profits more than doubled to $91 billion last year, according to Treasury figures used to back the Rudd government's controversial new industry tax.
The release of the previously secret analysis has inflamed the political row over the tax as the Rudd government toughens its criticism of the big miners and fuels industry speculation about a settlement with coal- seam gas companies.
 The data has brought the Treasury back to the centre of the debate as the Coalition said the numbers were wrong and did not justify a tax that threatened the mining industry.
But former deputy prime minister John Anderson, now a gas company chairman, added to expectations of compromises by saying Resources Minister Martin Ferguson understood the special needs of the coal-seam gas industry.
Treasury released the figures to support its conclusion that the profits surge had dramatically outpaced the rise in mining royalty and company tax payments underpinning Treasurer Wayne Swan's argument that Australians needed a fairer share of the commodities boom.
But Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey said the $91 billion figure was contradicted by Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing that industry profits were much lower.
The Coalition said the government figures suggested the 40 per cent tax on resource projects would apply to a tax base that was larger than total Â­industry profits.
 This just proves that the government spin is unbelievable and they take the most distorted information as the basis for their case for the mining tax,  Mr Hockey said.
He said the discrepancy between the Treasury figures and those from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Taxation Office highlighted the need for Mr Swan to release the tax analysis that underpinned the resource super profits tax proposal.
While the government has estimated the tax will generate revenue of $9 billion in its second year, it has not put a figure on the gross receipts excluding rebates and mining royalties and has not revealed its crucial assumptions about commodity prices. But Mr Swan's office said the debate had produced a range of figures based on different data and methods including four different sets of profit numbers cited by the Shadow Treasurer.
 Our numbers are Treasury estimates produced for the release of our tax package,  the spokesman said.
 All these numbers show the community has not been getting a fair share of resources, which can only be dug up once. 
Treasury released the data underpinning pie charts used by the Treasurer to show mining taxes halved as a share of profits over the past decade, two weeks after the underlying data were questioned and Mr Swan's Â­office failed to produce them.
The data, released on Wednesday in response to a Coalition question on notice asked in a Senate economics committee on June 1, shows company and Â­resource taxes rose from $15.2 billion to $24.2 billion between 2007-08 and 2008-09, but fell as a proportion of profits from 37 per cent to 26 per cent â€“ down sharply from 64 per cent in 2000.
The new statistics rely on unpublished ATO data, Treasury estimates and public data sourced from federal and state government budget papers.
The ABS data show resource companies' pre-tax profits were $64 billion, $76 billion including royalties, or $86 billion on a EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) measurement including royalties in 2008-09.
The profit figures calculated by Treasury take into account total mining sales and service income, operating costs including depreciation but excluding interest expenses and an Â­allowance for corporate capital.
The original furore over the numbers was sparked by the Treasurer's May 9 economic note, which included pie charts that showed charges for non-renewable resources plus company tax fell from 55 per cent of mining profits in the period 1999-2000 to 2003-04, to 27 per cent in 2008-09.
The charts also showed that excluding company tax, the amount the Australian community charges mining companies for non-renewable resources fell from one dollar in three of profit for the first half of the decade, to one dollar in seven today.
The government took aim at BHP Billiton in parliament yesterday by tabling a letter it had sent Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese last week asking for investment in a highway near a Queensland mine.
Mr Albanese said that showed that the resource companies could not be relied upon to build infrastructure themselves and that the resource tax was needed to fund such projects.
Mr Swan also attacked mining companies for attempting to take  windfall profits  from the nation's resources as Rio Tinto launched an advertising campaign emphasising how much it left in the country.
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also defended a warning to some mining company executives on Wednesday night that the government had a long memory. While the Treasurer took a firm line against the big miners, the industry turned to Mr Ferguson to achieve a compromise that could Â­appease coal-seam gas companies that have been far less critical of the government than BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata.
The government continues to try to cut a deal on the tax amid industry concerns that the coal-seam gas sector will secure special concessions Â­after coal-seam gas producer the BG Group described consultations this week with Mr Rudd as  productive .
Mr Anderson, the former Nationals leader who now chairs ASX-listed Eastern Star Gas, praised Mr Ferguson for understanding that the fledgling coal-seam gas sector faced different issues to other miners that must be taken into account.
Mr Anderson, who retired from politics in 2007, said Mr Rudd should listen to Mr Ferguson, who understood that the impact of the tax on coal-seam gas would be particularly onerous because of the investment profile of a new gas field.
 That is to say, you keep spending on infrastructure over the life of the field in a way that you don't through the life of a coalmine,  he told The Australian Financial Review.
 The tax in that regard presents particular difficulties that it might not for other sectors. 
Eastern Star Gas, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2001, is in the process of developing exploration licences in NSW.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"GAIL India, the country's biggest gasÂ transmission company, is in negotiations to buy liquefied naturalÂ gas from ventures in Australia, which it sees as a big future supply source.
India, Asia's third-biggest energy user, has growing demand for LNG and its existing and planned import terminals do not have fixed supply contracts to fill their capacity, said Sanjib Datta, general manager business development.
 State-owned GAIL India, which owns a stake in the Dabhol LNG import terminal in the western state of Maharashtra due to start up this year, has also been touted as a potential investor in InterOil's proposed LNG project in Papua New Guinea. It already has a 2 million tonnes a year purchase agreement forÂ LNG from Iran, while Qatar recently agreed to increase LNG supplies to India.
India plans to import 25 million to 27Â million tonnes a year of LNG in the next five to six years, GAIL estimates, which has previously been in supply talks with ventures in Australia but has yet to conclude any deals. Indian gas users such as power and fertiliser producers have been reluctant to pay higher prices, making it difficult to conclude LNG supply contracts.
 We expect Australia to emerge as an extremely important supplier of LNG for India and we are in discussion with some companies to source LNG from existing and prospective projects to meet our short term as well as long-term requirements,  said Mr Datta after visiting Australia for conferences and meetings.
Australia's first long-term LNG supply deal with India was concluded last year when ExxonMobil, a partner in Chevron's $43 billion Gorgon venture, inked a 20-year accord with Petronet LNG.
India counts alongside China as a rapidly growing LNG importer, but provides more scope for new supply contracts as China is widely regardedÂ as having already contracted most of the LNG it is forecast to need by 2020.
These expanding importers, along with prospective new buyers in Asia such as Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, are set to become more important for Australia's planned LNG projects, many of which are still seeking to nail down offtake agreements. Demand out of Japan, the world's biggest LNG buyer, is stalling while a market liberalisation process is complicating the outlook for imports into South Korea.
Santos and partner Petronas are seeking more customers for their Gladstone LNG project in Queensland, while Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips are yet to snare customers for their rival coal seam gas-based project. Chevron has yet to sell out its planned Wheatstone venture in Western Australia, while Japan's Inpex and partner Total have yet to announce customer agreements for their Ichthys project in Darwin. Woodside last year lost an initial agreement to sell LNG from its Browse venture to PetroChina.
Almost all of Australia's existing LNG production capacity of almost 20 million tonnes a year is committed under long-term supply contracts with buyers in Japan, China and South Korea.
GAIL plans to double its pipeline network between 2009 and 2012 to 14,000 kilometres, leaving scope for increased imports of LNG despite rising domestic production, Tony Regan, principal consultant at Tri-Zen International said yesterday.
While gas prices had been low, the government recognised the need for increases to support the development of offshore fields and LNG imports and was moving prices up substantially, he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Growing expectations of a gas supply deal between Russia and China could mean more discomfort for Australia's band of liquefied natural gas hopefuls.
While talk of a deal to pipe Russian gas into growing Chinese markets has been rife for years, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister recently said he expected a deal to be done by September.
 Any breakthrough would not be good for the likes of Santos and Origin Energy, both of whom would dearly love to lock in big LNG supply details with China this year.
The talks between Russia and China have long been stalled by disagreements over the price.
But whatever the final agreement, the Russian gas is likely to be far cheaper than gas coming all the way from Australia. Unlike traditional LNG buyers Japan, Taiwan and Korea, China is not starved of domestic gas supplies and can receive pipeline gas from neighbouring countries.
Macquarie said the increase in sources of supply would provide China with more options and the ability to get the LNG price down.
Progress between Russia and China is only the latest blow to Australia's LNG hopefuls.
The rapid growth of the United States shale gas industry has displaced large volumes of Qatari LNG previously destined for North America. That LNG is now looking for a home in Asia.
And recent gas price increases in China have offered added incentives to grow the nation's own gas production, which had been kept in check by the old price caps.
Macquarie said Australia would  unquestionably  continue to play a key role in the global supply of LNG, but potential developments on the proposed pipeline deal should be a reminder that not all local projects would be sanctioned.
Meanwhile, Citigroup said BHP Billiton could be a big winner out of the uncertainty in the Gulf of Mexico as the company was in an ideal position to acquire any BP assets that came up for sale as a result of its Macondo spill.
The broker said BP's stakes in their Atlantis, Mad Dog and Gunflint joint ventures were worth $US11 billion ($12.7 billion).
In addition, smaller oil and gas players unable to cope with the region's tighter new regulations may also become tasty morsels for BHP Billiton.

Project operator ExxonMobil is building two initial trains, or processing lines, at PNG LNG, although Oil Search is confident future discoveries in the country will support a third train. Oil Search has also been insulated from the federal government's proposed resource super profits tax because it has no oil and gas assets in Australia.
Curiously, Oil Search has been outperformed over the past three weeks by Adelaide-based oil and gas play Santos, whose major project â€“ the Gladstone LNG development â€“ is affected by the tax hullabaloo.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE Rudd government is hoping to announce progress on development of Queensland's coal-seam gas industry during a visit by Chinese customers in the next few days as intense talks continue on the proposed resource super-profits tax.
Facing strong political pressure to make progress in the battle with miners over the 40 per cent profits tax, the government is hoping to use revised estimates of revenue from the tax -- now up to $30 billion -- to allow greater flexibility in negotiations.
 But the big three miners -- BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata -- told fellow mining companies yesterday they intended to stand firm in talks and wanted to discuss ``matters of policy and principle', not ``near-term taxation revenue''.
In an internal memorandum to all members of the Minerals Council of Australia, the three biggest mining companies reassured all the other mining companies that they were not seeking a separate deal with the government and would continue to act in the interests of ``the industry as a whole''.
``BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata have stated they continue to seek a transparent, meaningful and timely consultation process on the RSPT,'' the memo said.
``The capital and investment profile and market risk for oil and gas projects and operations is fundamentally different to mineral sector projects and operations.''
Yesterday, Kevin Rudd invited Chevron Australia managing director Roy Krzywosinski to talks on the tax in Canberra.
Chevron operates the nation's biggest resource project, the
$43bn Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant being built in Western Australia.
It is also one of the partners in the North West Shelf LNG project, the only offshore project the Rudd government has said would fall under the RSPT.
``Fiscal stability is critical to attract the massive investment required to deliver long-term and complex energy projects like the Chevron-operated Gorgon and Wheatstone natural gas projects,'' Mr Krzywosinski said.
``Discussions with the government to date have been constructive and are ongoing.''
The company would not say more on the meetings with the Prime Minister.
``As previously communicated by government, the Gorgon, Wheatstone and Browse LNG developments can remain under the petroleum resource rent tax regime,'' Mr Krzywosinski said.
While the government has said new offshore projects already on the drawing board will remain under the petroleum resource rent tax, many in the oil and gas industry are worried about what regime projects beyond this will fall under.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte was also in Canberra yesterday but Woodside would not comment on the purpose of his visit.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"The Rudd government is preparing to offer the resources industry a far more generous allowance for its capital costs in a crucial concession on its controversial profits tax that would lighten the burden on all but a handful of the biggest companies.
The plan to limit the damaging political row over the tax also includes concessions for coal seam gas producers and a likely exemption for low-value commodities such as sand and gravel.
 But the strategy would not end the fight with big miners, such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, which are writing to their smaller counterparts to urge them to hold firm against the tax.
The concessions are being planned by key ministers but may not be announced in full until the end of the coming week of parliament, which could be the last before an election later this year.
The deliberations come as big miners vow to hold firm against any deal to  divide and conquer  the resources sector and as fears grow that coal seam gas producers in Queensland could be persuaded to accept the tax.
BHP Billiton, Rio and Xstrata sent a memo to all members of the Minerals Council of Australia on Friday saying that they were advocating changes to the tax for the mining industry as a whole.
The government appeared to make progress with other sectors, however, when Chevron Australia managing director Roy Krzywosinski correctmet Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson in Canberra on Friday.
A Chevron spokesman said later that  fiscal stability  was crucial to the company's plans. He said the talks had been  constructive  and Chevron remained committed to its Gorgon, Wheatstone and Browse Basin liquefied natural gas projects.
The meeting indicated the potential for a settlement between the government and gas companies, particularly those such as Chevron that can elect to keep their projects in the existing Petroleum Resource Rent Tax.
The government is working on ways to adjust the point at which the tax is applied to make it more favourable to coal seam gas producers, in effect reducing the amount that is subject to the 40 per cent tax. Methane can be valued at $3.50 per gigajoule close to its source but $12 per gigajoule after processing.
Also being canvassed are changes to the way a company's investments would be valued when the government refunded 40 per cent of a project's capital costs.
While the initial plan was to apply the book value of a project, this is fiercely opposed by companies such as BHP and Rio because their Pilbara assets have been largely written down even though they would be worth billions of dollars on the market.
The 40 per cent rate of the refund could be wound back to cover the cost to the budget of the change to market value.
Another option is to allow the PRRT for the emerging coal seam gas industry in Queensland and NSW.
After intensive consultations with about 80 mining companies and representatives, the government's view is that uncertainty about the tax has to be resolved soon because it risks damaging Labor's relations with business and its economic credentials with the wider community.
This follows reports from the finance sector that investment in mining projects has stalled since the tax was announced on May 2.
The superannuation industry also stepped up its criticism of the Minerals Council of Australia by urging the corporate regulator to investigate mining advertisements that warn of the impact of the tax on retirement incomes.
Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees chief executive Fiona Reynolds said one ad, featuring a retiree in Whyalla, could lead people to make decisions about superannuation that cost them money.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"With the Western Australian Government's plans for a liquid natural gas processing plant on the Kimberley coast unravelling, Premier Colin Barnett has repeated his intention to take the land needed by compulsory acquisition at the end of this month.
But whatever action the Government takes, it now seems approval for the plant could be years away.
 As ABC1's Four Corners reports tonight, a dispute over Native Title involving the Government's preferred site for the plant could take years to resolve, and the process of negotiation for the land is now being challenged in the Federal Court.
Two years ago supporters of the plan to develop a massive gas processing facility on the Kimberley coast boasted the deal could offer unprecedented opportunities to the region's Indigenous communities.
It has been estimated that local people could receive more than $1 billion over the next 30 years as they share in the resource riches.
Negotiations to choose a site began some time ago but were short circuited when Mr Barnett announced the location as James Price Point.
The point, 60 kilometres north of Broome, and the land around it are untouched by development except for some narrow walking tracks.
A preliminary agreement to develop the site was signed last year by the Government and the Kimberley Land Council.
That agreement now appears to be under threat due to legal action taken by local resident Joseph Roe.
Mr Roe has a Native Title claim against James Price Point and is resisting the development, saying it is a threat to Aboriginal heritage.
Currently, Mr Roe's approval would be needed to hand the land over to the State Government for the development.
Mr Roe lodged the claim to Native Title 15 years ago. The claim was never finalised, but it has never been challenged until the decision was taken to develop the site.
Mr Roe says the Aboriginal heritage at stake is a song cycle - the traditional story of the land and its law - which was handed down to him by his grandfather Paddy Roe.
Paddy Roe, who died in 2001, established the Lurrajarri Heritage trail along the song cycle on the land at James Price Point and was awarded the Order of Australia.
The trail is known for its annual nine-day walk, led by Aboriginal elders. The walk is thought to be unique and attracts tourists from all over the world.
Mr Roe's opposition to the development did not stop the Kimberley Land Council reaching agreement for the site with the Government last year.
But now Mr Roe says the council was not properly authorised.
The council itself admits that the process forced it to act under pressure and many in the region have questioned the process of consultation.
They point out the Kimberley Land Council has been given $16 million to pay for its work in consulting people from across the Kimberley.
Despite this, the council is now being challenged legally by Mr Roe and other Indigenous people are taking out their own Native Title claims on the land around the point.
All this has left the community divided, the Government angry and frustrated, and forced the company to put its development plans on hold.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"A new guide to the use of coal seam gas water has been released.
Principle environmental scientists with Wolry Parsons Ralph Gunness released the guidlines to a coal seam gas conference in brtisbane this morning
 Mr Gunness says even after reverse osmosis treatment, the brackish water that is pumped out of Coal seam gas wells can damage soils and crops.
 That water then needs the chemical constituent in that water need to be matched to what is in the ground, in an irrigation sense the timing, the volume and the chemical composition need to be very carefully considered before mass irrigation projects are undertaken.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Royal Dutch Shell's bid to secure Â­environmental approval for its revolutionary Prelude floating liquefied natural gas project off Western Australia has run into difficulty over the oil giant's refusal to commit to specific measures to minimise greenhouse gas emissions.
A ruling on the $5.7 billion project had been due from Environment Minister Peter Garrett's office by April 30, but has been extended until this Friday amid wrangling between Shell and the environment department over the issue.
 At the core of the issue is the delay in Australia's emissions trading scheme, which casts uncertainty over the regulatory framework that will be in place to offset the emissions when LNG production at Prelude Â­begins in 2016.
The dispute is sparking wider industry concern that the department is seeking to impose more onerous greenhouse conditions on projects without the backing of legislation.
Shell last year started detailed engineering and design studies for the development of its Prelude and Concerto fields in the Browse Basin. Gas will be extracted to the surface and processed through LNG facilities aboard what Shell says will be the largest vessel ever built. The company is targeting early next year to sanction the investment.
The project will emit almost 2.3Â million tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to more than half a million average cars.
In its draft environmental impact statement Shell said it might consider geosequestration, or underground, disposal for the reservoir CO2 at a later stage but held off from making any pledges.
That triggered a demand from the Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts that Shell specify its greenhouse gas mitigation plans in a supplementary document.
Shell has refused to commit to geosequestration and wants instead to flare the waste gas and rely on buying permits under a carbon trading scheme to offset the emissions.
 We view the current delays and uncertainties on the carbon pollution reduction scheme or any alternative as temporary and not significant enough to warrant any change in strategy for the Prelude LNG project,  it said. Geosequestration  has been examined at length by Shell but as yet has not been found to be technically and commercially viable , the company added.
Adding CO2 sequestration could boost the cost by up to 10 per cent.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Coal seam gas companies exploring in the Galilee Basin in Queensland's central-west have formed an alliance to discuss how the sector can develop sustainably.
Landholders in the Surat Basin are worried about the environmental impact of the coal seam gas sector.
 Comet Ridge Limited is currently drilling in western Queensland and is one of about 10 Galilee companies in the forum.
Managing director Tor McCaul says they are working on a regional water study as part of their planning.
He says they have been meeting with the Department of Environment and Resource Management.
 Because Galilee in a sense - in coal seam gas exploration, is a blank canvas - it is kind of really at the start of the journey,  he said.
 What we are trying to do is get it set up so that it happens in an orderly, sort of controlled and very environmentally friendly way.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"Groundwater engineer Colin Hazel told more than 200 people that â€œGroundwater is valuable and vulnerable and needs to be managedâ€? at the Basin Sustainability Alliance's seminar in Dalby on Thursday.
The seminar was a response to landholders' concerns that proposed Coal Seam Gas (CSG) mining will effectively dry up the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) which is the lifeblood of much of Queensland's agricultural industry.
 Mr Hazel detailed how groundwater is stored and how it moves, how the GAB was formed and how it works, the occurrence of coal and coal seam gas and the possible impacts of gas extraction and inter-aquifer transfer of water resulting from it.
â€œMonitoring is vital,â€? Mr Hazel said.
â€œJust like we check our temperature to monitor our health, we need to be monitoring and recoding the (groundwater) levels and quality to check on the health of our groundwater systems.
â€œWe are stewards of this water for future generations â€“ for our children and our grandchildren.â€?
Other speakers spoke strongly about the need for the government to protect groundwater resources, with Great Artesian Basin Protection Group secretary Anne Kennedy calling for an independent inquiry into coal seam gas exploration and water extraction.
â€œI have grave fears that this issue will become the asbestos issue of the future,â€? she said.
Major Projects and Economic Development manager for Western Downs Regional Council Jane Holdsworth said while the council supported a balance between the mining of resources through our rich region and the protection of prime agricultural land which will sustain the region well beyond the energy boom, she was concerned about the possible impact of coal seam gas extraction on the region's water resources.
â€œWith the number of coal seam gas wells across the region predicted to peak at approximately 40,000, with an estimated 280,000 million litres of by-water extracted annually, concerns about the affects on groundwater supplies are justifiable,â€? Ms Holdsworth said.
â€œAnother issue is the 54 million tonnes of salt waste, produced through the treatment of extracted water, and the proposal to bury that waste in landfills in the region.
â€œHowever of greatest concern is the fact that there is currently no research being undertaken on the cumulative affects of these major projects and the consequent effects on the GAB and alluvial aquifers.â€?
Solicitor Peter Shannon of Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers highlighted the holes and limitations of the current water legislation, the need for landholders to be fully informed of their rights when dealing with coal seam gas companies and warned not to sign anything without legal advice.
Chair of the Basin Sustainability Alliance Ian Hayllor said the seminar had offered an opportunity for people to improve their understanding of the significant issues surrounding groundwater and the possible impacts of coal seam gas exploration on both local ground water reserves and the GAB.
He said the number of people who came along to the seminar including high profile community leaders, researchers, landholders and members of the general public, was a sign of the level of concern.
â€œThe community is so concerned that the government is not doing all it can to protect the Great Artesian Basin through legislation and monitoring, they are prepared to spend their valuable time learning all they can about the issues, knowing that good depth of knowledge is going to be so important when communicating environmental concerns to the State Government and coal seam gas companies,â€? Mr Hayllor said.
â€œWhat was learnt from Colin Hazel's very informative presentation will be invaluable to all who attended the meeting when working towards their goal of saving the Great Artesian Basin for future generations.â€?

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE first compromise on the super-profits tax could be announced as early as today amid speculation the Rudd government will allow Queensland's coal-seam gas industry to operate under a revised petroleum resource rent tax.
Under the proposed deal, the new tax rate would also apply to future offshore petroleum projects and the giant North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project.
 The news came as West Australian Premier Colin Barnett announced that the state government would back the merger of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto's iron ore operations after extracting an increase in royalties and a one-off cash payment.
The oil and gas compromise is believed to have the support of the industry and comes after a stream of high-level oil and gas executives visited Canberra last week.
Last night, industry sources said negotiations with the oil and gas producers -- those planning onshore and offshore projects -- could lead Canberra to announce a blanket tax regime for oil and gas projects as early as today.
The sources said Canberra's proposed policy would mean gas projects that would have fallen under the resource super-profits tax would instead operate under a revised PRRT.
The PRRT is a 40 per cent tax that kicks in at 5 per cent above the long-term bond rate (of about 6 per cent), while the RSPT, also a 40 per cent tax, kicks in when profits reach the bond rate.
The North West Shelf, Australia's biggest working resources project, is the only project that is not included under the current PRRT regime, and it was to come under the RSPT.
Under the planned amendments, projects would benefit from some tweaking to the existing regime, the sources said.
Companies would be able to have assets taxed at market value or the value they paid for them, rather than at book value, meaning they would be able to depreciate larger amounts.
The revised proposal could allow the tax to be paid at the point gas is extracted instead of at the point where it leaves the country. Any tax proposal would apply to all new onshore and offshore gas projects.
Mr Barnett announced yesterday that from July 1, BHP and Rio would have their royalty rates rise from the concessional rate of 3.75 per cent, introduced in the 1960s, to 5.625 per cent, bringing them in line with other iron ore producers such as Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group.
Under the proposed RSPT, that money would be reimbursed to the miners by the federal government.
BHP and Rio will make a one-off payment to the state of $350m, which will be used to build a new children's hospital in the state.
Mr Barnett said it was decided at a cabinet meeting yesterday to create a trust for the 250-bed children's hospital into which the two companies' lump sum payment would be placed.
Building the $1 billion hospital will begin in 2012, and it is scheduled to open in 2015.

Queensland tycoon Ken Talbot may have built his fortune on coal, but there is more to the Talbot Group investment story than just the black rock.
 While the immediate plight of the self professed  humble coalminer  is still unclear, his ability for making profits buying and selling small- and medium-sized mining companies made him one of the most well-watched figures in the industry.
Accordingly, last year Mr Talbot took out the Dealer of the Year award at the annual Diggers and Dealers Mining Forum in Kalgoorlie for picking the top of the market in his sale of Macarthur Coal shares to steel giants ArcelorMittal and Posco in 2008. The deal netted him close to $700 million.
The profit from Macarthur made him one the country's richest men, but Mr Talbot invested most of it back into the resources sector, buying into a number of prospective energy and metals through his private investment vehicle, Talbot Group.
Though not all of his investments have matched Macarthur, Mr Talbot's name appearing on the share register has been a sign for many investors to buy in.
 He is a big name in the industry and once people see that he is on the register money follows him, [but] also follows him out,  Pengana Capital fund manager Ric Ronge said.  When he is on the register it has been enough to propel the share price,  Mr Ronge said.
Although the Talbot Group had established a reputation for investing in coal sector stocks, Mr Talbot has stakes in a number of exploration groups that hold potentially large-scale, long-life projects in key commodities.
The value of Mr Talbot's interest in Indonesian-focused gold company Robust Resources â€“ last reported at 16.7 per cent of the company â€“ has almost tripled since the group bought into the stock in June 2009.
Robust has a joint venture with PT Gemala Borneo Utama, which gave it access to the entire mineral rights for Romang Island, about 500 kilometres north-west of Darwin. The stock closed 4.7 per cent lower at $1.61 yesterday.
In March, he offloaded his 32.7 million shares in gold explorer Southern Gold at 10Â¢ each, pocketing close to $1 million profit after buying in nine months earlier. The stock closed at 8.5Â¢ yesterday.
While Mr Talbot's investment strategy was riding the ramp-up phase of prospective exploration companies, some observers commented that his move into Africa-based assets such as Sundance Resources based in Cameroon reflected a noticeable increase in the risk-return profile of his investment group.
Analysts contacted by The Australian Financial Review said major investments in high-risk African countries offered attractively sized assets, but were complicated by undeveloped infrastructure.
Late last year Mr Talbot sold his 16.3 per cent stake in Mozambique-based coking coal explorer Riversdale Mining to Brazil's third-largest steelmaking company Copmanhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) for $190.5 million. Riversdale, which is still a year off producing, has an estimated 13 billion tonnes of hard coking coal assets.
Despite Mr Talbot's successful track record, market watchers have suggested the success of some of his investments have become  self-fulfilling prophecies , afforded more by reputation than fundamentals.
The Macarthur Coal founder bought a stake in highly prospective Karoon Gas in May 2007 for $22.4 million. After a Browse Basin gas discovery, the stock quickly became a market darling, rising more than 580 per cent between October 2008 and July 2009. However, in the time since a spate of disappointing results from subsequent drilling results has prompted some investors to question the company's potential. Despite this, Mr Talbot's holding is now worth close to $170 million.
 He is obviously a guy who has a good nose for a deal and he has a following in the market and that has helped support his initial investment,  Mr Ronge said.
According to the Talbot Group's 2009 annual report, it had generated a three-year average return of more than 70 per cent on an annualised basis.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"RESOURCES ROW
The federal government is talking to mining companies about easing the impact of the resource super profits tax on the treatment of acquisition and capital costs for the coal seam gas sector.
 One option is for coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas projects such as that proposed by the BG Group for development at Gladstone, Queensland, to be taxed under a regime similar to the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) rather than the RSPT.
But at the same time resource companies are pressing for more generous valuation of existing projects at market rates rather than book value.
In a temporary cessation of their differences over the tax, senior Â­resource company executives joined Prime MinisterKevin Rudd, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson to welcome Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping, who is visiting Australia, and to witness the signing of over $7 billion in resource contracts.
The government seized on the contracts as a sign that the prospect of a new resources tax was not dampening investment in the sector, despite claims to the contrary by the opposition and some mining executives.
Some resource company executives were also expected to take the opportunity to meet Mr Ferguson to continue negotiations on the design of the tax, although others are understood to be unwilling to attend meetings unless the government agrees to discuss issues such as the 40 per cent headline tax rate.
Ministers believe the government will not be able to win the support of the big miners such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata to even a modified resources tax.
Trade Minister Simon Creanand Fortescue Metals Group chief executiveAndrew Forrest witnessed the signing of 10 agreements with Mr Xi.
 These agreements put paid to the exaggerated claims by some mining executives that the RSPT would Â­undermine Chinese investment in Australia,  Mr Crean said.
 As I have consistently said, the Chinese have been asking questions seeking clarification on the tax. There has never been any suggestion by the Chinese that the RSPT would harm investment in Australia. 
The Minerals Council of AustÂ­ralia released modelling by consultants KPMG showing that even if the government modified the RSPT to make it more like the PRRT, it would continue to disadvantage companies internationally.
 The modelling shows that a PRRT-style 'compromise' â€“ notably through an increase in the so-called uplift factor and more favourable Â­depreciation arrangements â€“ is not a sustainable solution,  the KPMG report said.
 Across five of the six commodities, Australian projects under a PRRT model would still be pushed well back in the global development pipeline, destroying investment, jobs and national income.
 And under a PRRT-type model, the effective tax rate on mineral commodities will range between 47 and 55 per cent, a quarter to a third higher than the global average.

One option is for CSG-fed projects to be taxed in a way similar to the petroleum resource rent tax.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,2,"TIMOR CANBERRA, June 23 AAP - Australia has no preference for the location of the Greater Sunrise gas plant, proposed for offshore East Timor, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says.
The fledgling nation's president, Jose Ramos-Horta, is visiting Canberra and met with Mr Rudd on Wednesday to discuss the liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant among other issues.
 The plant's developers, led by Woodside Petroleum, want the plant floating offshore, while Dr Ramos-Horta argues it must be built on East Timor.
Mr Rudd told reporters his government had no preference.
 Australia does not support any particular location for processing the LNG,  he said.
 We agreed that this matter should be settled in the processes consistent with our treaty obligations.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,2,"WOODSIDE Woodside said that, despite both illegal and protected industrial action that has occurred at the site since December 2009, it continued to target first gas from Pluto in early 2011.
 The project currently remains within market guidance, with a target start-up by end February 2011 and first LNG (liquefied natural gas) by end March 2011,  Woodside said in a statement on Wednesday.
  However, continued industrial action would delay mechanical construction activities and consequently impact the project schedule and cost,  the company said.
Last year, Woodside admitted the costs of the Pluto project had blown out from $11.2 billion to as much as $12.3 billion due to lower than expected productivity in both onshore and offshore construction.
Once complete, the project will process gas from the Pluto and Xena gas fields, about 190km north-west of Karratha in Western Australia.
The two fields are estimated to contain 4.6 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of dry gas reserves.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"A leading energy forecaster says Western Australia is well-placed to ride out low natural gas prices.
BP chief economist Christof Ruhl says an oversupply of gas on the market will only last for the next two to three years, and then prices will begin to climb back to normal levels.
 Mr Ruhl says Australia's importance as a gas and coal producer in the region is solid.
 I think it's important for three reasons, one is just strategic location, I think it's also important because, different from other large energy producers, it is a country with competitive structures and you are free to invest and thirdly it's important because by being different, it sets also an example,  he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE winds of a coal seam methane compromise continue to waft from Perth to Brisbane via Adelaide with speculation Kevin Rudd will confirm by the end of the week that Australia's newest energy industry will fall under a modified petroleum resources rent tax regime rather than his proposed resources super tax.
It needs to be said that some sort of broad concession from the Prime Minister and Treasurer Wayne Swan to Queensland's coal seamers is crucial to protect Gladstone's progress from a coal and aluminium port to a regional liquid natural gas hub.
 According to research by Morgan Stanley, forcing the super tax on a two-train LNG operation that converts coal seam methane into exportable frozen gas would cut the rate of return from almost 16 per cent to an uncompetitive 13 per cent and reduce the net present value of a project from $14 billion to $7bn.
A petroleum resources rent tax modified to meet the burgeoning industry's specific needs would reduce the internal rate of return to something like only 14 per cent and net present value to $9bn.
Morgan Stanley reckons investment in Gladstone LNG would be justified on those metrics.
The reason there is such a difference between the proposed super tax and the old rent tax is that the so-called ``uplift'' factors are so much more generous under the petroleum regime, and although the two schemes share the same headline rate of 40 per cent, a project is not liable to pay PRRT until all costs have been recovered.
Exploration costs are carried forward at the long-term bond rate plus 15 per cent and pre-production costs at the bond rate plus 5 per cent.
The current understanding of the super tax is that the uplift will be set at the bond rate, which is now 6 per cent, and as things stand, the pre-production capital expenditure will be recovered by depreciation. In other words, tax will leak to the commonwealth much earlier in the maturity cycle than it does under the PRRT.
And the situation is a little more difficult and precarious for existing projects because their tax liability would be assessed based on historical book values rather than market or replacement cost.
The lower the assessed value of the project, the sooner it would start producing what Treasury tech-heads like to describe as super profits.
And that is why the likes of Woodside's Don Voelte have been storming around Canberra over the past couple of days.
Woodside owns one-sixth of Australia's biggest resources project, the North West Shelf, which has been 30 years in the making and is still sucking in the investment dollars.
And back in 1985, when the Hawke government introduced the PRRT, the project was viewed as so important to the nation but so vulnerable to retrospective alteration of its investment settings that it was exempted from the new tax.
But, as things stand now, the NW Shelf will be hit by the super tax and the project's impost will be established on historical rather than market valuations.
The same can be said for existing onshore gas projects.
It should be recalled that the PRRT hits only production from fields in commonwealth waters. That means, for example, that Santos has historically paid state royalties only and income tax on profits generated by its Cooper Basin gas and liquids project.
Continued on Page 40
Continued from Page 39
But, barring compromise, that project will not fall under the super tax, although it would seem very likely that if the deal is done for east coast LNG aspirants, it will certainly be extended to the NW Shelf and the Cooper.
Interestingly, it is only now, about 25 years after the introduction of the PRRT, that we are seeing the second generation of offshore LNG projects that will actually end up paying the Hawke government's tax.
The second big reason why a compromise with the gas guys works for Rudd is that restoring the viability of Gladstone's LNG future represents excellent politics on at least two fronts, even though it further exposes the flaws of his super tax.
As The Australian's polling of three Queensland marginal seats suggests, Rudd is on the nose in his home state and his super-tax proposal must have had some influence on that.
And don't doubt Labor's internal polling is not pointing to the same sort of crisis in public confidence in Western Australia.
Any arrangement that has the coal seamers and the more mainstream offshore LNG sector slipping under the PRRT could underpin some sort of recovery in Rudd's standing and potentially put a consensus-busting wedge in anti-super-tax forces.
When the government launched the super tax on May 2, it did so in the belief its effective guarantee over losses would encourage those operators currently covered by the PRRT regime to jump ship and work instead under the RSPT. Wrong.
It should be noted that some in the gas sector are deeply aware of the broader ramifications of embracing compromise, and others could give a damn about the prospect of the energy sector leaving the miners to fight their cause alone.
The feisty Voelte is said to be in that second camp. And who can blame him? Woodside currently does not pay any sort of rent tax on income generated at its NW Shelf LNG project and the super tax, given its essential flaws, would seriously denude the investment metrics that support Australia's biggest resources project.
Voelte doubtless appreciates the mess the super tax creates for the miners, but he has his own shareholders to look out for.
A quirk of the deal
A QUIRK of Colin Barnett's royalty deal with the Pilbara Twins is that the re-drafting agreements promised as part of the settlement will relax secondary processing requirements.
The Premier agreed yesterday that the deal would result in a ``modernisation'' of secondary processing commitments installed by the political grandfather of Western Australia's iron ore industry, legendary premier Charles Court, who had dreams that the northwest would one day host a steel industry.
To that end, BHP blew $2.5bn by building and then blowing up the Boodari hot briquette iron plant at Port Hedland. BHP is said to be comfortable it has met the obligations under the state agreements. Rio Tinto, on the other hand, might not be so confident that its currently mothballed HIsmelt pig-iron plant at Kwinana satisfies requirements of some of its state agreements.
But Barnett is prepared to recognise that times have changed and aspirations need to match achievable realities.
Drafted agreements might, for example, allow for secondary-processing obligations to be transferred to third parties that might want to add value to the Pilbara iron ore. And they might recognise investment in community amenity as a means of settling the score.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,2,"Readers tell us what they think about the issues of the week
The intended expansion of open cut coal mining and coal seam gas extraction is becoming a very serious issue in many parts of Queensland particularly on the Darling Downs, one of the premium food producing areas of Australia. A recent statement by Michael Roche of the Queensland Resources Council suggested it is not all that important to protect the strategic cropping areas of the Darling Downs as in the future we will be able to import our food from China and India.
 What a ridiculous statement â€“ to suggest we should substitute our clean, green food with a very inferior product. Granting approval for coal seam gas projects with all the associated problems that can arise from this procedure is indeed a very backward step.
When questioned by Jane Patterson, rural presenter, a couple of weeks ago, Stephen Robertson and Michael Roche had no answers regarding the salt issue and the possible interference with the water level of the artesian basin.
Having lived and farmed in both southern New South Wales and Haystack, Queensland for over fifty years, I believe I have a reasonable idea of the far superior quality of the food producing capabilities of the Darling Downs. These strategic food producing areas should be left intact for the benefit of future generations and not permanently destroyed for a short term gain.
I strongly believe that any activity that damages such areas should be seen as a criminal act.

In support of Robert Williams' comment re increase in water charges Wandoan CN 10-6-10.
Wandoan, unlike other towns in Western Downs Regional Council is built on the precipice sandstone underground water formation with a huge supply of water (if the mining industry doesn't stuff it up).
Thanks to the foresight of previous councils (two) such bores were drilled to supply the town without the restrictions imposed on the residents of other towns in the Western Downs region.
With steel casing and concrete, the life of the bores could last up to 100 years.
Council water charges should be levied at cost plus a margine to allow for future repairs and maintenance.
If increased water supply is required for future expansion for the proposed coal mine then this should be paid for by the recipients of the tax royalties profit i.e. the Federal and State Governments and the mining companies, not the residents who have paid for the water infrastructure in the past.
Residents should be encouraged by council to grow trees to act as a buffer zone from the proposed mine a few kilometres west of the town that will create dust 24/7.

Customer service
I am writing in response to the article published in last week's issue (17/06/10) of Chinchilla News regarding the closure of Watson's Retravision in Miles.
The owner, Paul Watson, states the reason for closure is due to little support from the community.
I think that people find it hard to support a business when they get absolutely no customer service.
I have been into the shop on a few occassions, and every time have been totally ignored by staff.
I have found that plenty of other people around town have had similar experiences in the shop.
I have heard first hand of a situation where a customer was told that they could not buy an item because staff couldn't find a price for it! What a joke!
I'm also aware of staff refusing to discount display stock that was stained/ damaged.
They obviously weren't very interested in making a sale.
If local businesses want local customers, they need to provide competitive customer service, instead of blaming customers for their downturn.

No-one has looked at the tractor that fell in the sink hole yet. Maybe the mechanic is busy?

Wandoan water woes
I have lived in Wandoan for the past 50 years and at my present address for 40 years.
Our home was purchased new without a blade of grass, tree or garden.
In what has been a labour of love, my husband and I have brought our yard to what we consider a real asset in the beautification of the town.
Now, because of the huge increase in the cost of water, our backyard at least will revert to its original state â€“ bare dirt.
Over the years, the cost of lawn seed, trees and garden plants together with general upkepp has been very significant and it will be heartbreaking to watch it die.
Nothing will survive our summer temperatures of 40+ degrees without a fair amount of water.
I also wonder why we fall under the banner of other towns where the cost of supplying water is much higher than ours.
Another query is â€“ will the revenue collected from water costs in Wandoan stay in our town or will it be swallowed up in other projects of no benefit to us.
Our population consists of a majority of elderly citizens who will never be able to afford these charges, therefore the interest of a small garden or a few potplants will be taken away.
Our town will deteriorate further and facilities (which are now minimal) will be even less.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"KEVIN Rudd is edging towards a deal with the coal-seam gas industry over the resource super-profits tax, but the concessions are unlikely to satisfy Australia's biggest mining companies.
The Prime Minister signalled yesterday progress was being made with sectors of the mining industry, but an announcement is not expected until later next week, after his scheduled return from the G20 summit in Toronto and a trip to New Zealand.
 Wayne Swan has pulled out of this weekend's G20 summit to work with Resources Minister Martin Ferguson on a resolution to the row over the mining tax.
With further meetings with major mining companies expected tomorrow, the Business Council of Australia will warn the government today that the public doesn't want to see political leaders trying to pit one section of the business community against another.
In a speech in Canberra, BCA president Graham Bradley is expected to broaden the attack on the RSPT by saying it was damaging the whole economy and Australia's appeal as an investment destination.
Mr Rudd said yesterday the government wanted ``a profits-based tax, one levied at 40 per cent, a tax which applies to existing projects, and one which is capable of delivering the revenue to meet the government's policy priorities''.
But he warned that ``if we reach this balanced and sensible outcome, I can fully predict that a number of the major mining companies will still not be happy with it. But that does not preclude us from engaging those companies who wish to be substantively engaged in negotiations.''
For weeks the government has been expected to compromise on the proposed tax by exempting low-value quarry products used in housing and farming, doing away with a 40 per cent government guarantee for failed projects and raising the profit threshold for the tax from about 6 to 12 per cent.
Because the coal-seam gas industry involves all new projects which will get the full benefits of depreciation and establishment costs, the government has been more hopeful of settling with that industry, particularly in Queensland. The three biggest mining companies, which will pay the bulk of the proposed tax -- BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata -- are holding out for it to do away with taxing existing projects.
Meanwhile, the government's amended renewable energy scheme passed the Senate with Coalition and Green amendments. The government will have power to regulate the price of household renewable energy certificates if there is a new glut.

 Last November, Woodside warned that its original $11.2 billion budget for Pluto would increase by 6 to 10 per cent due to  lower than budgeted productivity . Since then, the project has been struck by two bouts of industrial action.
Earlier this year about 2000 construction workers went on strike over Woodside's  motelling  policy, which refused to guarantee workers the same accommodation each time they were on site. The action was later ruled illegal.
The current strike is believed to centre on demands for a 7 per cent pay increase.
While Woodside has to date managed to work around the stoppage, the company has almost exhausted the work it can do without the heavy-lifting cranes operated by the striking Mammoet workers.
The production delay means Woodside will struggle to meet its first LNG delivery commitments to the project, although Woodside chief Don Voelte has previously flagged the company already has contingency plans in place in the event it misses its deadline.
Woodside said it would make an application to Fair Work Australia to suspend the crane operators' strike.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the risks of another budget blowout at Pluto were  reasonably high .  If you can't get your heavy lift equipment on, you can't get the electricians and welders to do their work, so it has a real flow-on effect,  Mr Hirjee said.
Woodside's $2.5 billion capital raising last year meant the company's balance sheet should be able to weather any cost increase, he said, while the company could purchase spot LNG cargoes to meet their delivery commitments.  There's a fair amount of spot LNG in the market at the moment .â€Š.â€Š. given the US isn't taking as much LNG as initially first thought,  he said.
Pluto is the first in a wave of LNG plants either under construction in, or planned for, Australia.
Construction of the $43 billion Gorgon LNG project, also in the Pilbara, started last year, while up to three LNG projects in central Queensland could be approved for development by the end of the year.
In addition, the Papua New Guinea LNG project was given the go-ahead by its partners last December.
Mr Hirjee said the increasing pace of activity in Australia was adding pressure to labour markets and adding to the vulnerability of LNG projects to industrial disputes.
 As the labour force tightens up, the industrial relations risk tightens. This is an issue for all companies looking to develop projects in the LNG space,  Mr Hirjee said.
 The labour market for LNG Â­expertise is very tight, and your skilled workers are going to be highly valuable. There's a lot of pressure coming through. 
KEY POINTS
Woodside's Mammoet workers have been on strike since April 28.
The company may now not produce LNG at Pluto before next year.
The labour market for LNG is very tight due to a scarcity of skilled staff.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"He may have delivered the message in more measured terms than did his Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, but the sentiment from East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta was the same: East Timor wants its own liquefied natural gas project.
Mr Ramos Horta used his visit to Canberra yesterday to press the case for the Greater Sunrise gas fields â€“ which straddle borders between Australia and East Timor â€“ to be proÂ­cessed through a specially built LNG plant in East Timor.
 Woodside Petroleum and its partners in Greater Sunrise, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips, this year agreed to develop the field via a revolutionary floating LNG platform.
That decision immediately Â­atÂ­tracted the ire of the East Timor Â­government, which wants the LNG plant on its shores as a way of stimÂ­ulating the country's economic and Â­industrial development.
Although Mr Ramos Horta made it clear the developing country was still set on having an LNG plant on its own soil, he did speak in more conciliatory tones than some of his counterparts.
Mr Ramos Horta said he did not support a pipeline to East Timor  out of patriotic duty'', but was concerned about Woodside's floating LNG option and its costings for a subsea pipeline to East Timor.
 Let's sit down and scrutinise the costs of the various options and see what makes real commercial sense for all of us,  he said.  For Australia as a country.â€Š.â€Š. for Timor Leste and for those who are putting their money in it â€“ the companies.''
Promisingly, Mr Ramos Horta said the East Timor government was prepared to discuss the situation with the Greater Sunrise partners.
 Our government remains open to dialogue with the consortium,  he said.  The very first step that has to happen is for very frank transparent discussion about all options.''
Although Sunrise sits closer to the East Timor coast, a 3000-metre deep, seismically active ocean trench makes piping the gas to Timor costly.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte is in Canberra this week and it is believed he will have a brief meeting with Mr Ramos Horta.
However, Mr Ramos Horta's role as head of state carries less direct legislative authority than that of Prime Minister Gusmao, who has been vehement in his opposition to the option of a floating LNG project.
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he did not have a preference for where the gas from Greater Sunrise was processed.  We agreed this matter should be settled in the processes consistent with our treaty obligations,'' he said.
The Greens, meanwhile, yesterday released polling that showed 58 per cent of Australians supported the East Timorese plans for Greater Sunrise, compared with 28 per cent support for Woodside's plans.
Greens leader Bob Brown vowed to vote with the East Timor government in the Sunrise Commission and Joint Commission, which regulates the field.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said diplomatic talks were working towards resolving the issue.
 It'd be in everyone's interest to get those resolved and move the project forward, and that's certainly what Woodside will be working towards,  Mr Hirjee said.
Woodside has previously said the East Timor government's preferred development option for Greater Â­Sunrise would cost $US5 billion ($5.7 billion) more than the option of a floating LNG project.
Modelling by Woodside has estimated East Timor would collect roughly 40 per cent of the project's royalties, worth about $US19 billion over the life of the field, despite the country's having an effective 18 per cent share of the field in its waters.
Woodside's proposed floating LNG project will produce 4 million tonnes a year of LNG as well as condensate.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Some investors feel conned by the hype surrounding smaller coal seam gas companies and their share prices, Paul Garvey discovers.
Lee Jovanovski thought it looked too good to resist. On the morning of April 8, Gold Coast-based coal seam gas company Icon Energy lodged an announcement detailing an extraordinary deal with China.
 The company said it had agreed to sell $32 billion worth of liquefied natural gas to Chinese company SinoGas Group, starting with shipments in 2014.
Jovanovski, who has traded shares from his Perth home for the past three years, immediately got excited.
Here was a company, at the time valued at around $150 million, securing a memorandum of understanding to sell tens of billions of dollars of gas.
 I thought it was unbelievable. I read a little bit more and thought, 'okay, why isn't this stock at $3 or $4?',  he says.
Jovanovski bought 100,000 shares at 46.5Â¢, a price he believed was a bargain. Earlier that day the stock had risen from 32Â¢ at the opening to trade as high as 65Â¢.
Unfortunately for Jovanovski, the shares fell as quickly as they rose. Over the next few days they fell to the price before the announcement. Yesterday the shares were trading at 21Â¢, leaving Jovanovski down almost 60 per cent.
 I'm just an average investor, I'm not too sophisticated, I invest in a lot of stuff I read, especially [ASX] announcements, and I just feel like I've been taken for a big ride and I'm sure a lot of people are in a similar position to what I'm in,  he says.
The merits of Icon's gas deal have been heavily debated among investors and the industry itself. Some industry experts and analysts have warned that Icon is an example of a growing credibility gap in the coal seam gas sector generally.
Mining companies have been a hot news topic over the past month because of the planned resource super profits tax. But before the debate started, many investors were making big profits and losses trading gas explorers which were signing huge sales contracts with Asian buyers. Once the resource tax debate is resolved â€“ and there are reports a deal is likely to exempt Queensland's coal seam gas industry â€“ investors may shift back in to coal seam gas stocks.
Icon Energy illustrates the risks they face. How does a company with two tenements in the Surat Basin, which is yet to define any gas reserves and whose work in coal seam gas to date has suggested the field is uneconomic, sign a $32 billion deal?
There is incredulity among some observers over how a company in Icon's position could achieve a goal of shipping its first LNG by 2014, given it has no LNG development plans. Santos and Origin, much larger companies which have been working in coal seam gas for a decade, are also shooting for LNG production by 2014.
One senior coal seam gas executive said he was baffled Icon could sign such an agreement, given it is yet to demonstrate it can produce coal seam gas commercially.
 It doesn't mean the Chinese company they're dealing with isn't really clever and is getting in cheaply and is prepared to take a risk, but I do struggle to see how a company that is still drilling core holes and has minimal production is in a position to even contemplate the offtake the agreement would entail,  he says.
Another Melbourne-based fund manager described the Icon MoU as  a joke. I just think that gives everyone a bad name, that sort of thing,  he says.
Scepticism over coal seam gas is nothing new, having persistently dogged the industry in Australia even as it was transformed from a niche sector into a major industry courtesy of tens of billions of dollars in deals involving some of the world's bigger companies.
But the controversy surrounding Icon reinvigorated critics of the industry, fuelling concerns over what the future holds for the next generation of Australia's coal seam gas companies.
Pengana Capital portfolio manager Ric Ronge has long been circumspect about the coal seam gas industry. While the wave of major multibillion-dollar deals that swept through Queensland in recent years would suggest his concerns have been unfounded, he maintains the industry carries large technical risks not yet factored into company valuations.
 There really is going to be a day of reckoning in one way or another,  Ronge says.  It's a hot market and you've had some proponents in that industry who have been very good at selling themselves, and there's been money made out of nothing in the last few years, which has really surprised us. 
Fundamental to Ronge's concerns is just how much of the vast coal seam gas resources and reserves identified so far will be able to find buyers in Australia and overseas.
At a project level, Ronge warns that each field has its own set of technical risks and variables which can torpedo projects no matter how large any early-stage resource estimate may be.
 Coal seam gas itself will have a place in terms of alternative energy; the question is how much of the power mix could that make up,  Ronge says.
 Each play is individually different in terms of the field dynamics, permeability, porosity, water salinity, water handling issues and proximity to infrastructure. 
Much of the criticism within the coal seam gas sector has come from within the oil and gas industry itself. Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte has long been the highest profile and most vocal critic of the coal seam gas sector, arguing that he cannot see how the coal seam gas-fed LNG plants proposed for Queensland will be able to compete with the conventional LNG facilities being operated and constructed by Woodside and its peers in Western Australia â€“ and that was before the coal seam gas industry was hit by the proposed resource super profits tax.
The rift between coal seam gas companies and their conventional rivals has also been blamed for a new push to overhaul guidelines for calculating gas reserves and resources. Whether through concerns for the sector generally, through professional jealousy or a combination of both, some conventional oil and gas companies have privately expressed deep concerns over the methodology used by their coal seam counterparts in arriving at resource and reserve figures that vastly eclipse most of Australia's conventional fields.
For some, the coal seam gas sector has invoked memories of the tech boom, when the limitless potential of the internet allowed small companies to make bold predictions about future earnings.
In the case of coal seam gas, the abundance and predictability of coal seams throughout Queensland and New South Wales has allowed companies to calculate substantial resource bases relatively quickly and easily. Companies have been able to identify huge  contingent resources , quite often having used little more than historical coal exploration data and government surveys.
While those large resource estimates can capture the imagination of investors, critics and indeed supporters of the coal seam gas industry have expressed concerns the big numbers can lure in investors without fully realising the substantial steps and technical risks in converting such figures into real, profitable production assets.
Wilson HTM analyst John Young is generally positive on the coal seam gas industry, but says it is important to understand the technical aspects of each company's acreage and its likely ability to commercialise its gas.
 The location of coal seams is generally reasonably well known, and those coal seams generally contain significant quantities of gas. You can end up with large numbers in terms of gas in place, just by virtue of the extent of the coal and the physical characteristics,  Young explains.
 Just because a coal seam is out there and has gas in it does not necessarily mean there's going to be a commercial resource there that can be developed. 
On Young's estimates, more than 200,000 petajoules of coal seam gas has been identified on the east coast. Over the next 30 to 40 years, he estimates domestic markets will consume a total of about 40,000 petajoules, depending on the rate at which coal-fired power is phased out. The coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas facilities that are being planned for Queensland will â€“ depending on the final number of processing lines ultimately built â€“ consume between 60,000 and 110,000 petajoules.
Unless other markets can be found â€“ and Young believes they can â€“ that leaves between one half and one quarter of the coal seam gas that has been identified without a home for several decades.
Wesfarmers produces LNG from micro-scale facilities in Western Australia for use in its transport fleet and BOC Gas is proposing a network of micro-LNG stations along the east coast of Australia.
More immediately, there is a question over whether the major international raids on Australian coal seam gas plays, which has helped stimulate and fortify valuations in the sector, are over.
The string of big deals involving foreign oil and gas giants â€“ starting in early 2008 with Petronas' $US2.5 billion purchase of 40 per cent of Santos's coal seam gas assets and which continued through to the current $3.4 billion bid by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina for Arrow Energy â€“ has done more than anything else to put the industry on the map for investors.
It has also helped spawn more than a dozen new coal seam gas plays each hoping to cash in on the increased market appetite.
Wilson Asset Management portfolio manager Matthew Kidman says the acquisition frenzy of the past couple of years will likely grind to a halt with the acquisition of Arrow.  The big land grab is done,  he says. The majors now involved in the industry will set about proving the as-yet-untested process of converting coal seam gas to LNG actually works.
Kidman points to the experience of Australia's first LNG plant, the North-West Shelf project, as an example of how such industries can take a while to truly shine.  There was a time when its returns were terrible,  Kidman says.  That might be the case here; it might take longer and be a bit harder than people expected. 
Bell Potter institutional dealer Athol White sees the coal seam gas sector as an attractive one, but believes the really big dollars have already been made.  The smaller guys are proving up the reserves, but now they've got to figure out how to monetise it,  he says.
Simply selling any gas identified into one of the LNG projects being developed by the majors in Queensland is unlikely to be a winning strategy, he says, as the majors will prioritise their own gas over any minor parties and will likely offer only severely discounted prices to put third party gas through their facilities.  I still think there's money to be made by those smaller guys, but it's not just a free for all,  White says.
Given the question mark over how the next crop of coal seam gas companies will commercialise their gas, it becomes clearer as to why Icon Energy was so enthusiastic about its deal with SinoGas.
The return of Icon's share price towards its pre-announcement levels suggests investors are not convinced Icon will deliver on the agreement. Icon knows there are sceptics of its story. The company's managing director, Ray James, says the company's deal will generate the momentum to advance its assets.
 It's better to aim high and fail than aim low and succeed,  James said at a press conference in Melbourne which was called to explain the detail of its deal.  We are not ignorant . . . of the enormous task that is here, but rather than seeing this as a task, we see it as a great opportunity. 
Whether it's a task or an opportunity, Jovanovski hopes the scepticism that has surrounded Icon since its announcement will prove misplaced.
But he says he feels conned, not confident.  We need some sort of protection from statements like [that of Icon Energy]. They're big sucker statements they brought out, and a lot of people have now been burnt by this,  he says.  If they did it without mentioning the ridiculous numbers they did, it would've been a different story.
 They mention those big numbers â€“ a $32 billion contract â€“ it's a big statement to make. To me it feels like a con job.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"A multi-billion-dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) project for Gladstone in central Queensland has won approval from the State Government.
Premier Anna Bligh says the Government's coordinator-general has completed a review of Queensland Gas Company's (QGC) Curtis LNG project near Gladstone and approved it subject to strict conditions.
 Under the project, coal seam gas will be extracted from the Surat Basin and piped to Gladstone.
Ms Bligh says the conditions include the provision of affordable housing and other social benefits.
It will have to develop 250 houses for workers in Gladstone, as well as 280 on the state's western Darling Downs.
Under the project, coal seam gas will be extracted from the Surat Basin and piped to Gladstone.
Ms Bligh says up to 8,000 jobs will be created.
Premier Anna Bligh says the approval of the project is a great step forward for the LNG industry and will benefit a large part of the state.
 Something like $5 billion per project - that is a lot of work for workers in the region,  she said.
 It's also a lot of business for all of those companies that supply materials and goods and services from as far away as [Rockhampton], down to Chinchilla and Dalby.
 It's going to be great, particularly for that south-west region as well. 
The company is expected to make an investment decision later this year and start shipping gas out of Gladstone by 2014.
Ms Bligh says a resolution between miners and the Federal Government on tax would reduce uncertainty about major Queensland projects.
She says she has spoken to Julia Gillard about the resource super profits tax, and she is confident that there will be a resolution.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Queensland is a step closer to a new natural gas industry after the Curtis LNG project received state environmental approval.
It comes with strict conditions on project owner Queensland Gas, including the provision of affordable housing for Gladstone and the The Western Downs.
 Queensland premier Anna Bligh says the project had questions marks because of the resources super profits tax, but the outlook is now much brighter.
 When you're making an investment, a multi-billion dollar investment, with all of that infrastructure commitment, of course you want to have certainty about the taxation arrangements going forward because you want to know what your rate of return is going to be,  she says.
 I think the rise of Julia Gillard into the Prime Ministers roll signalled very clearly yesterday that there is some room to move and resolve some of these outstanding issues on the mining tax. 
The proposed Curtis Island gas plant, off Gladstone in central Queensland, will have the capacity to export about 8.5 million tonnes of LNG per year, worth over $6 billion.
It will be linked by a 340 kilometre pipeline from gas fields in the state's western Darling Downs.
The Curtis LNG projects still has to gain Commonwealth environmental approvals and a final investment decision.
Many Gladstone residents have welcomed the news saying it means more jobs.
But a local conservation group has concerns about the development.
The Capricorn Conservation Council's Ian Herbert hopes parts of the island away from the gas works can be turned into a national park.
 We would like to remind the government that this does involve a huge loss of habitat of natural areas in that area  he says.
 We would like something serious done about turning the whole of the rest of Curtis Island apart from the south end (where the export facility is earmarked to be built) into a national park, lets get serious about reserving some big areas.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,2,"Friends of the Earth tours Cecil
Brisbane's Friends Of The Earth and the Basin Sustainability Alliance are bringing environmental activists from Brisbane and Toowoomba to Cecil Plains and west of Dalby on Saturday to give them more information about how proposed coal and coal seam gas mining may affect one of the country's major food bowls.
 The group will also visit New Acland where coal mining has begun and more has been proposed.
Veteran environmental campaigner Drew Hutton said the visit would further cement friendly relations between urban-based environmentalists and rural people, both of whom share serious concerns about the likely impacts of coal and coal seam gas on agricultural land, the Great Artesian Basin and health.
â€œWe could have filled three buses with the number of city people interested in making this trip,â€? Mr Hutton said.
â€œWe will soon see the development of a green/farmer alliance that will force the State Government to re-assess its too-hasty commitment to these destructive mining projects.â€?
Mr Hutton believes that agriculture and environmentalists need to bridge the gap that has traditionally existed between the two schools of thought.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,2,"Exploration company says it's a positive finding
TESTING of coal seam gas near Casino has revealed the future energy source is environmentally and financially efficient.
 Gas exploration company Metgasco tested the gas source rec-ently and was pleased to find it had no carbon content.
The absence of CO-2 meant that gas as an energy source created significantly less carbon emissions than coal-fired electricity, the company said.
Metgasco was recently given the go-ahead to build its gas-powered Richmond Valley Power Station 4km south-east of Casino after discovering the largest conventional gas resource in NSW history.
When functioning, the power station will produce enough electricity to power 30,000 homes on the Northern Rivers.
Metgasco chief financial officer Glenda McLoughlin is delighted with the test results.
â€œIt is a very positive finding,â€? she said. â€œWe have tended to find most of the reservoirs we have tested are quite low or have no CO-2.
â€œCO-2 is not worth anything and you do not want to try to handle carbon. When carbon is in gas usually you need to strip it.
â€œGas also has lower carbon emissions than coal when it is burned as electricity. It can bebetween 30 and 50 per cent less than coal.â€?
The test results were ann-ounced to investors through the Australian Stock Exchange on Tuesday, pushing the Metgasco share price up by 1.1pc yesterday to $0.46.
The public company also underwent an internal reshuffle with board members recently.
Board chairman Peter Power is retiring from July 1, handing over the reins to deputy chairmanNicholas Heath, and the boardalso appointed a new non-executive director, Leonard Gill.
Despite the internal changes and an improving ASX price, the proposed $50 million power station and use of the local gas source is still a way off.
â€œWe are still waiting for ourproduction lease to be granted by the NSW Government,â€? Ms McLoughlin said.
â€œI think the current uncertainty under the mining super profit tax creates an element of uncertainty. We don't know what it is going to look like, and it makes decisions about investment difficult.
â€œWe are now talking to people about buying the power. We have some parties interested.â€?

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"UK gas giant BG is poised to snatch the lead from Santos in the race for Queensland's first liquefied natural gas project after securing key state environmental approvals for its multibillion-dollar venture.
Premier Anna Bligh will today announce the approval of BG's Queensland Curtis (QCLNG) project, with federal government clearance likely to follow within weeks. Although Santos and partner Petronas have already secured state approval for their Gladstone LNG project, they are still seeking more customers for their gas, while BG has all its planned capacity earmarked for customers in China, Japan, Singapore and Chile.
 With the principal government approvals tidied away, the government's resource super profits tax will be left as the sole obstacle to a final investment decision on QCLNG, estimated by Deutsche Bank to cost $20 billion. Incoming Prime Minister Julia Gillard yesterday pledged to directly negotiate with industry on the RSPT in an effort to end the stand-off with resource companies over the tax. TheyÂ have warned it threatens theâ€ƒviability of the coal seam gas-based LNG industry.
Under conditions imposed by the government BG will have to provide affordable housing to offset the expected impact of rent increases due to the scale of the project. The Queensland government expects the venture to earn more than $6 billion a year in exports and employ up to 8000 people.
In May, Catherine Tanna, managing director of BG's QGC subsidiary, said the company is still targeting this year to sanction the QCLNG project, while underlining the need for a  supportive  fiscal regime.
Santos and Origin Energy, developer of a separate LNG venture at Gladstone, have warned of potential delays to investment decisions on their Queensland LNG projects due to the potential impact of the RSPT,
BG, which already produces LNG in Egypt and Trinidad, has been the most successful of the crowd of proposed gas export ventures in Gladstone in attracting customers.
Santos and Petronas have been seeking a second customer for more than a year, while Origin's venture with ConocoPhillips has yet to attract any buyers.
Royal Dutch Shell's Gladstone project with PetroChina, while following a later timeline, also benefits from the backing of Shell's LNG portfolio.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"LEADING mining accommodation owner/operator The MAC Services Group has launched plans for a new village near Gladstone.
The publicly listed company will initially build 300 accommodation units on a 50ha site at 149 Stowe Rd in Calliope. It is about 15km south of the industrial city, which expects to provide up to 23,000 new jobs for the building and operation of the multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas and coal export industries.
 ``We realised that Gladstone was a place we should be in about three, four years ago and it took that time to find the right location,'' The MAC Services chief executive Mark Maloney said.
``We will probably look at starting full construction (at Calliope) very soon.''
Mr Maloney said The Mac Services Group aimed to invest up to $100 million in the Gladstone area.
``The first phase will be about the $20 million mark (for the) 300 accommodation units and over time we will be working with council to expand those numbers. We are also looking at a second site in Gladstone as well.''
The group already has about 5000 rooms under management with five villages in Queensland's Bowen Basin and one in Western Australia.
Mr Maloney said, as well as the Calliope Accommodation Village, there were plans to build another five villages in Australia's resource precincts.
The Calliope Accommodation Village will be similar to other MAC villages and will comprise fully furnished one or two-bedroom units, recreation areas, a kitchen and other facilities for a mixture of fly-in-fly-out and long-term tenants.
Mr Maloney said the group aimed to ``help those who work in the resources and related industries to be their best
at work''.
``We look after them, provide them with a good bed to rest in, good food, recreation, whether it be in one of our taverns or in one of our gyms,'' he said.
``Our business is based around people and people in the resources industry.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"BG's chief flew in this week to make a deal with the former PM
RESOURCES
 FRANK Chapman has had better weeks.
The BG Group chief executive flew in from London under the radar this week, confident there was a deal to be signed off with the Rudd government that would let his $10 billion-plus Queensland coal-seam gas export project go ahead under a certain tax regime.
He left on Thursday evening disappointed and frustrated.
Although BG's proposed Curtis Island LNG facility won state government approval for the project following a meeting with Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, Chapman still has no confidence at all on how the massive project will be taxed.
The tough and blunt East Ender landed in Brisbane on the BG corporate jet after dusk on Monday. He dropped into his local head office before trekking to Canberra to meet the prime minister on Wednesday alongside Shell Australia chairman Ann Pickard and other senior representatives of the LNG industry.
In an attempt to drive a wedge between the miners and Queensland's burgeoning liquefied natural gas industry, Kevin Rudd was poised to agree to a very generous deal for the gas companies to transition coal-seam gas projects. The same deal would have applied to the North West Shelf with the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT).
The plan had been for a deal to be finalised and then announced yesterday.
The Weekend Australian has confirmed from several sources that the transition arrangements were proposed to last for five years.
The deal entailed a far higher hurdle rate at which any tax kicked in compared with the controversial proposed resource super-profits tax (RSPT), which stands at the commonwealth bond rate, or just under 6 per cent.
One source says the rate would have been more than twice that figure for the gas producers -- in fact, even more generous than the PRRT, which is about 11 per cent.
Even more importantly, unlike the RSPT, development and acquisition costs could have been written off during the transition, further significantly lowering the point at which any tax kicked in.
The Rudd plan had been resisted ferociously by Treasury Secretary Ken Henry, the architect of the RSPT, who feared the consequences of making concessions with segments of the broader industry.
But Rudd needed to take back control of the negotiations from Henry and Treasurer Wayne Swan.
It was too late.
News of the leadership spill against Rudd broke that evening and Julia Gillard was installed as Prime Minister the next day.
Any hopes the LNG executives had of wresting the concessions and gaining investment certainty were dashed -- at least temporarily while Gillard decides her next moves.
BG refused to confirm any details of Chapman's discussions with Rudd or the broader government bureaucracy.
``We have been engaged with the government and Treasury since the proposal was announced and will continue to do so,'' a BG spokesman says.
Perth-based Woodside chief Don Voelte was also in Canberra this week, trying to sign a deal that would have seen the North West Shelf LNG project, which Continued on Page 26
Continued from Page 25
would have fallen under the RSPT, operate under a sweetened PRRT.
Sources confirm the deal would have been neutral, possibly even positive, for the project.
Voelte has also headed back to Perth disappointed, with no certainty on the future tax regime under which his biggest earning project will operate.
Certainty is more important for the CSG players, who are not only trying to make final investment decisions this year but are also trying to secure buyers for the gas under long-term contracts and, in the case of Santos, sell a stake of up to 19 per cent in their projects.
Both CSG projects and the North West Shelf (the only offshore project not subject to the PRRT) would come under the RSPT in its current form.
Rudd wasted no time using the concession as a wedge.
On Monday night, before many big oil and gas players knew they had won a compromise, miners in consultation with the government were told that a concession was on the way. They were told the CSG players and the North West Shelf partners, who had been quietly negotiating while the mining industry railed loudly against the new tax, would both be getting a favourable deal.
In truth, they already knew. Top executives from mining heavyweights BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata had been pressuring their LNG brethren the week before to not ``break ranks''. They accepted that the CSG to LNG players deserved special treatment but they feared a situation in which the government favoured one sector to the significant disadvantage of another.
They probably sniffed victory and a potential change of government, so did not want to allow Rudd any wins in front of the electorate. That dynamic led Swan last weekend to make an outburst, claiming that ``some companies are not behaving in an honourable way'' in the debate and were using ``strong-arm tactics to silence other companies both in the mining companies and more broadly in the economy''.
Industry sources say they believed it was a direct reference to the mounting tensions between the big miners and the gas producers.
A major difference between the PRRT and the RSPT is that the former kicks in at 5 per cent above the long-term bond rate (of about 6 per cent), while the RSPT, which is also a 40 per cent tax, applies to profits above the bond rate.
Oil and gas producers are unclear where the deals stand now but see no reason why the proposal should not go ahead.
But if Gillard can negotiate with the miners, she might not be so keen to do a deal with the oil and gas players.
There is not even certainty there, however.
The mining industry, while publicly optimistic about Gillard's tax plans, has reasons to be worried.
In her first televised speech as Prime Minister, she said Australians needed a fairer share of the nation's mineral wealth and the government intended to have the budget in surplus by 2013.
In parliament, she said the miners had agreed they could pay more tax, something no miner has said publicly.
Earlier this month, Minerals Council of Australia chief Mitch Hooke was asked whether this line, which had also been used
by both Rudd and Swan, was accurate.
``The mining industry has made no secret of the fact that as you profit, you pay more tax; history has shown that, today shows that and the future will show that,'' was all Hooke would say.
Rio chief executive Tom Albanese has also said that he believes the company pays a fair amount of tax.
If Gillard and Swan are still prepared to give the oil and gas players concessions, they could be told of the outcome next week.
But if Canberra only made the deals to drive a wedge between the miners and the oil and gas industry, it may take longer to work out whether the miners and Gillard are really able to enter genuine negotiations.
It might be best for the coal seam gas industry if they are not.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"QUEENSLAND'S booming LNG industry could have serious cumulative social and environmental impacts, the Co-ordinator-General has warned.
In a report giving conditional approval to Queensland Gas Company for its multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas scheme in central Queensland, Co-ordinator-General Colin Jensen admitted that not enough was known in some areas about the impact of all the planned projects.
 Mr Jensen has also warned that cropping lands and state forests could be damaged and ``a number of potential negative impacts are also identified relating to housing, health and safety, social infrastructure and traffic and transport''.
In a pointer to how serious the issue is, Mr Jensen has banned using water that is a by-product of the gas extraction for dust-suppression on roads because it would cause ``widespread, irreversible, serious environmental harm''.
Mr Jensen said he was concerned the impacts and costs to the environment and future generations of Queenslanders would be substantial if large areas of land - and potentially water - became contaminated as part of CSG-LNG activities.
``My conditions are clear and will not allow salt from coal-seam gas water to leach into the environment,'' Mr Jensen said.
Environmentalists and local farmers from the western Darling Downs are outraged that approval has been given to two major LNG projects without what they claim is any knowledge of the long-term impacts on important agricultural land and underground water.
QGC has said it was confident it could address all of the concerns raised in the report, although environmentalist Drew Hutton said the Co-ordinator-General's report showed that the scheme was an ``uncontrolled experiment''.
QGC must still get federal government environmental approval and Mr Hutton and farmers are planning a Traveston Dam-style campaign to fight it.
The big issue for QGC is that it would produce more water from coal seam gas extraction than the Tugun desalination plant and that water would contain 5.5 million tonnes of salt over a 20-year period.
The company plans to sell that salt. If it can't sell it, the last option is to bury it in strictly controlled landfill, which has raised concerns among farmers.
Mr Jensen also demanded QGC take into account the Tara Blockies, a group of socially disadvantaged landowners whose land is likely a target of the gas companies. But a spokesman for the residents, Michael Bretherwick, said locals were outraged.
``If they start to drill here they will have the mother of all confrontations. We will lock them out and lock them in,'' he said.
Farmers have also threatened blockades.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,2,"BG Group, whose Curtis Island liquefied natural gas project was cleared by the State Government yesterday, will want a speedy resolution to the resource super profits tax debate to meet its export deadlines.
The State Government yesterday gave conditional approval for BG subsidiary Queensland Gas Co to build an LNG liquefaction and export site at North China Bay on Curtis Island, near Gladstone.
 QGC is hoping for federal environmental approval ``around mid year''.
But QGC, and the three other major LNG proposals in the wings, still need ``clarity'' on the Federal Government's proposed RSPT if they are to finally commit to investments likely to run to around $15 billion each.
And that is something BG/QGC hope to do before year's end, so as to meet a tight timetable to deliver their first LNG into export markets in 2014.
BG's Australian head Catherine Tanna reiterated in a statement it would consider a final investment decision later this year ``subject to acceptable fiscal terms''.
BG's project is considered by analysts to be leading the LNG pack in Queensland, followed closely by Santos.
BG has Japanese and Chinese customers for the LNG it produces and it is considered to have better coal seam gas reserve coverage than Santos, at least at the moment.
Santos has agreed to sell some LNG to its partner Petronas but is still hunting for another customer.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,2,"The federal opposition has tipped the government will do a deal on the controversial resource profits tax with the coal-seam gas industry, excluding the big miners from negotiations and painting them as extremists.
The opposition also says any backdown on the resources tax will require an emergency mini-budget to redraw budget projections.
 The government is not tipping its hand, although it is reportedly prepared to move on the previously off-limits rate of 40 per cent.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said any decision on changes to the tax would be driven by what is in the national interest.
 I'm not going to play a rule in, rule out game,  she told the Nine Network.
The damaging row between the mining industry and the government contributed to the unease within Labor that culminated in the dumping of Kevin Rudd and the rise of Ms Gillard.
Showing the government's concern over the issue, Ms Gillard used her first media conference to call a truce, announcing an end to TV advertising promoting the tax.
Ms Gillard said on Sunday that gesture of goodwill was a big step forward.
 We asked the mining industry to reciprocate and in an act of goodwill they have,  she said.
 That's given us a terrific foundation to now have the genuine negotiations we need to get to a conclusion here. 
Ms Gillard said the government would work with the mining industry to get a fairer share for Australians.
 The mining industry generally says yes, we can pay more tax, so the central question before us is the how question, how do we get this done, and I believe we can work together to answer that question. 
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said he expected Ms Gillard to strike a deal with the coal-seam gas industry.
 There will be a big announcement shortly about a deal with the coal-seam gas people. She'll then say problem solved, let's have an election,  he told ABC Television.
 Now of course there won't be a deal with BHP, with Xstrata, with the main miners, who are the main foundation of our export income. She'll try to dismiss them as being extremists, that'll be her style. 
Opposition finance spokesman Andrew Robb said projected combined surpluses of $6.4 billion in 2010-11 budget years three and four unambiguously depended on $12 billion in mining tax revenue.
He said Treasurer Wayne Swan's  absurd  claim at the G20 Summit that the federal budget did not hinge on mining tax confirmed the budget was a  house of cards . Claims the budget would return to surplus in three years could not be believed, he said.
 If the mining tax revenue is not there the budget collapses, major programs will need to be slashed and Wayne Swan's reputation will be in tatters,  he said in a statement.
 Consequently, Labor will have no alternative but to bring down an emergency mini-budget. 
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh backed Ms Gillard in making the mining tax her top priority.
 The mining tax is important to get right. Here in Queensland we want to see more investment in the mining industry and we want to see Queenslanders and Australians get their fair share for the resources that are being mined,  she told reporters.
 Right now, we know there is a problem, and I'm very encouraged to see that the mining companies and the new federal government have called a truce on the war of words.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,2,"Housing group Queensland Shelter has welcomed the strict conditions imposed on a multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) project through southern and central Queensland.
The State Government's coordinator-general has approved the Queensland Gas Company's (QGC) Curtis LNG project.
 But the company will have to build 530 houses for workers in Gladstone in the central region and on the Darling Downs in the south.
The project will extract coal seam gas from the Surat Basin which will be piped to a production plant in Gladstone.
Queensland Shelter spokesman Adrian Pisarski says mining companies should also contribute to a building fund.
 That trust can then be used as a bit of a capital bank for community,  he said.
 Housing providers [could] come into these areas and look at a range of community housing types of provisions, so that we actually have a discounted market rent being offered to a range of low income workers. 
Mr Pisarski says it is good to see governments and mining companies addressing the problem of housing affordability.
 We've been pressuring governments and energy companies and mining companies and whatnot to have a look at this issue for at least five years now,  he said.
 So it may be a little too late but at least government recognises there's an issue and is putting conditions on some of these developments.

AGEE,The Age,2010,2,"THE Gillard government is days away from unveiling a reworked version of its resource rent tax.
The redesigned tax will cut the impost that would have faced coal seam gas and also liquefied natural gas produced from the previously exempt North West Shelf.
 Low-profit industries such as sand and gravel will remain outside the net, paying royalties as at present.
The changes will boost the level at which the new tax cuts in, and modify the plan to carry the industry's losses â€” both of which are expected to appeal to the big miners.
It is unclear whether the government will cut the 40 per cent rate.
Pressed yesterday to confirm Mr Rudd's position that the 40 per cent rate was a core element of the tax, Prime Minister Julia Gillard left open the issue.
 Each and every decision I'll take, as we genuinely negotiate, will be driven by what is in the best interests of the nation,  she told the Nine Network.
 I'm throwing open the door of the government . . . I think we are well on our way to seeing an opening of the minds and a respectful, genuine negotiation. 
The package to go to cabinet today is not final: it will leave out details still to be negotiated â€” perhaps for months â€” with the miners. The companies say they have heard nothing new from the government, with one big miner saying it is yet to be invited to a meeting.
The reworked tax is likely to be unveiled later this week after Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan returns on Wednesday from the G20 heads of government meeting in Canada.
It will be sold as raising much revenue, making use of higher forecast commodity prices for petroleum, iron ore and coal.
On ABC Radio's Sunday Profile, Resources Minister Martin Ferguson would not say if the change would be a  tinkering with  or a  wholesale rewriting  of the tax, but it would remain  profits-based .

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Australia's budding liquefied natural gas industry can withstand souring market conditions and more than double in size over the coming Â­decade, says one of the world's leading energy economists â€“ but only if the country's reputation for fiscal Â­stability survives.
Speaking exclusively to The Â­Australian Financial Review's new Resources Daily website, InterÂ­national Energy Agency chief economist Fatih Birol said that, despite a looming short-term global LNG glut, Australia had a golden opportunity to dramatically expand its LNG Â­industry.
 More than a dozen LNG projects representing over $200 billion in Â­investment are either under construction or proposed for development in Australia.
But the outlook for LNG markets has been tempered in recent months, with mounting concerns of an imminent oversupply.
While Dr Birol said gas markets were heading for a major glut in the short term, China's continued growth should ensure healthy demand for Australian LNG by the time most LNG projects come on stream, from 2015 onwards.
Dr Birol said the sharp, unexpected growth of the United States' shale gas industry into a major source of supply had been akin to a  silent revolution  in gas markets, causing the swift reversal of the US from an importer of gas into a self-sufficient market.
At the same time, new LNG developments already underway around the world are set to double global LNG supplies within three years.
 Plus, some major traditional gas-consuming countries are going through economically difficult times. Europe's gas demand today is back almost 10 years because of the economic crisis, and there is not enough demand,  Dr Birol said.
 Putting all these things together, there is a major gas glut coming. 
But Dr Birol said a moratorium on new LNG developments from the world's biggest producer, Qatar, coupled with the continued growth of the Chinese economy and falling LNG exports from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia meant there was still a window of opportunity for Australian LNG companies.
The IEA expects China's power capacity to grow over the next 15 years by the equivalent of one United States, with increasing government desires for cleaner burning sources of power likely to ensure much of that new capacity is met with gas.
 So who in that region is going to meet that growth in demand? I don't see any obvious country except for Australia,  Dr Birol said.
 There is a very good case for Australia, if the country gets its investment framework right, to be â€“ especially after 2015 â€“ the rising star of gas markets and capitalise on that substantial growth. 
The IEA expects Australia's LNG export capacity to grow from 40 billion cubic metres to 90 billion cubic metres by 2020 as China's energy demands continue to grow.
Dr Birol said he did not want to go into detail about the government's proposed resource super profits tax given the system was under negotiation, but said Australia's history of fiscal stability was part of its competitive advantage as an LNG producer.  These projects are very long lead-time projects, their capital costs are very high, and therefore one needs a stable investment framework here,  he said.
 Investors would know what are the rules of the game. They are large-scale projects, and once you push the button you cannot turn back. 
Despite the uncertainty created by the tax, he said Australian LNG projects had an edge over potential gas competitors. Iran, he said, was unable to attract investment, Nigeria had security issues and Malaysia and Indonesia were directing their reserves into domestic markets.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"RESOURCES ROW- LNG
The coal-seam gas sector believes it has won key changes to the proposed mining tax, but needs quick confirmation to secure the planned $50 billion of liquefied natural gas projects in central Queensland.
 Industry sources said a deal to switch the coal-seam gas sector to a petroleum resource rent tax model was nearing completion before Kevin Rudd was deposed.
The sector was hopeful the Prime Minister Julia Gillard could agree to a compromise in a matter of days.
 The coal-seam gas deal is basically done,  one source said.
 The coal-seam gas guys have got major decisions to make and cannot wait that long. 
The companies behind the Queensland LNG developments â€“ which include Adelaide-based Santos, Origin Energy and England's BG Group â€“ collectively need to secure tens of billions of dollars in project finance for their proposed developments.
Three coal-seam gas-fed LNG projects proposed for the region had been targeting final investment decisions this year, but none is likely to get board approvals to go ahead until the tax argument has been settled.
Discussions over project finance and long-term sales agreements have stalled since the new tax was announced, with the sector pushing for a speedy resolution.
 They cannot cast [the tax] off into the tall grass until after the election and hope no one notices,  another source said.  They've got to get something done. 
The Queensland LNG industry had shaped as a likely stage for a compromise on the tax, given its ability to deliver major expenditure commitments to politically sensitive electorates in the build-up to a federal election.
Sections of the government are understood to be willing to offer concessions on its controversial tax but want to push its final decision beyond the coming federal election.
BG Group last week received environmental approvals from the Queensland government for its proposed LNG project on Curtis Island, leaving it needing only federal environmental approval before it can make a decision.
The International Energy Agency has warned that a stable fiscal regime was crucial to Australia's growth as an LNG exporter. Speaking exclusively to The Australian Financial Review's new Resources Daily website, IEA chief economist Fatih Birol said the long lead times and high capital costs of LNG projects meant any changes to the investment framework could hurt investment.
 Investors would know what are the rules of the game. They are large scale projects and once you push the button, you cannot turn back,  DrÂ Fatih said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Natural gas infrastructure business APA Group plans to move further into power generation through a potential acquisition of assets from ailing utilities player Alinta Energy.
In an interview, APA managing director Mick McCormack confirmed the company was looking at Alinta assets, and said it was interested in more than Alinta's stake in the Goldfields Gas Pipeline.
 Alinta owns 11.8 per cent of the Goldfields pipeline; APA owns the rest. Mr McCormack agrees it is a natural fit. But looking over the Â­Alinta portfolio of assets, final bids for which are due in August, APA has a wider brief.
 Our first priority will be to look at assets that are either on, or related to, our core skill which is gas transmission and gas distribution,  Mr McCormack said.
 Related to strategy could be some power generation, for example. Power generation hooked up to our own pipelines means that we can invest in power generation directly and have the secondary benefit of that power generation increasing demand for gas on our own pipelines. 
APA owns some gas-fired power generation through its 19.9 per cent owned Energy Infrastructure Investments vehicle with Japan's Marubeni Corp and Osaka Gas.
Power generation facilities hooked up to APA's pipelines were of interest because the company wanted to ensure those facilities continued to use gas, and could be expanded if needed, Mr McCormack said.
But APA would not seek to take on market risk in terms of gas or electricity, he said.  We would prefer to have tolling arrangements where we set the power station up and the electricity is sold on a long-term contract to somebody. 
Mr McCormack wouldn't be drawn on whether APA might be particularly interested in the Port Hedland and Newman power stations in Western Australia, which are among Alinta's assets, saying it would be interested in any opportunity that might relate to its business.
Alinta declined to comment.
Elsewhere, APA would be interested in increasing its holding in natural gas distribution outfit Envestra. APA owns 31.7 per cent of the business, which has gas distribution networks and pipelines. Envestra could not be reached for comment.  If the opportunity presented itself, we'd certainly consider that, but equally we're very happy with our interest in that business,  said Mr McCormack.
APA also has a 16.8 per cent stake in infrastructure player Hastings Diversified Utilities Fund, which owns pipelines business Epic Energy.
Hastings has a strategic review under way, which could potentially lead to the sale of Epic.
A Hastings spokesman said the strategic review was on track and when completed, it would communicate it to all security holders.
Mr McCormack said APA hadn't heard anything about the process from Hastings, and hadn't been approached on a deal for Epic Energy.
 They've been very quiet,  he said.  Irrespective of what comes out that, we'll watch with interest.

 Australia's budding $50Â billion coal- seam gas industry is set to emerge as the key winner from the resources tax compromise expected to be Â­announced as early as today.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard will be in Queensland, where four major coal-seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas projects are planned.
There are expectations that the government has struck a deal to allow the coal-seam gas companies' projects to be taxed under an adapted version of the petroleum resource rent tax, which has governed Australian offshore oil and gas projects since the 1980s.
While the PRRT carries the same 40Â per cent tax rate as the government's contentious resource super profits tax, it has more generous Â­uplift rates before it applies.
A PRRT-style tax would allow companies to recoup their full capital costs before they had to pay the tax, as opposed to the RSPT, where companies would have to depreciate their capital costs over the life of the project and pay the tax immediately.
By being able to recoup sunk capital costs up front, companies would be able to pay off debts earlier and significantly reduce the cost of Â­financing projects.
And a PRRT would ensure coal- seam gas projects were subject to the same tax regime as offshore energy projects, creating a level playing field in the industry.
Coal-seam gas projects involving Santos, Origin Energy and England's BG Group have been targeting final investment decisions as early as this year, although the tax debate has caused uncertainty.
If a PRRT model is adopted, analysts believe the projects â€“ which represent potential investments of tens of billions of dollars each â€“ could be approved for development relatively quickly.
Macquarie Research analyst Adrian Woodsaid a PRRT for the sector made  complete sense , as it was already well understood, not just by oil and gas companies but also by their existing and potential customers. While coal-seam gas companies would  take a hit  under a PRRT, the damage would be much less than that from the RSPT.
 It's definitely a workable compromise,  Mr Wood said.  Buyers understand and know the PRRT; it's an Â­established regime, so you don't have to wait for the dust to settle and iron out the details. 
Buru Energy executive directorEric Streitberg, who is also on the board of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said the PRRT was  the lesser of two evils .
 We're not welcoming any change to the tax regime, but if there is going to be one, we'd prefer it to be a PRRT,  he said.
 It's been a long, hard 20-year battle to get the PRRT into a form that works reasonably effectively, and we'd be hoping any extension of the PRRT would keep those principles. 
Full details of the tax compromise are unknown, though some sources suggest the 40Â per cent rate could be lowered.
There is also uncertainty about the treatment of state royalties on production, with the government having pledged to reimburse miners for their royalty payments. The sometimes lengthy window between a project coming into production and having to pay PRRT taxes could lead to the federal government reimbursing state royalties for years before it starts receiving tax revenue.
There have been suggestions the government could allow companies to add incurred royalties to the capital costs that can be claimed before the PRRT tax applies, while other sources suggested state governments could strike a deal to scrap royalties in favour of an annual payment from the federal government.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,2,"Chevron has signalled that Asian liquefied natural gas customers are unlikely to snare a stake in the expected expansion of the $43 billion Gorgon project in Western Australia as part of any deal to buy fuel from the venture's next two production units.
The United States oil major has stepped back from its initial strategy of attracting Asian gas buyers by allowing them the opportunity to purchase a direct interest in the giant project, with only its first three Japanese customers for Gorgon getting equity stakes in the initial three production trains.
 Many Asian LNG buyers typically seek to become partners in projects as well as customers, but depending on the strength of the market and of the production venture, those equity interests may be hard to come by as gas producers are hesitant to give away value.
Santos is seeking to sell a stake in its Gladstone LNG venture to a customer, while BG has sold an interest in its Queensland Curtis venture as has Chevron in its separate Wheatstone project. But stakes in less risky, more profitable expansion projects are more rarely available.
Chevron's executive vice-president of global upstream, George Kirkland, said in March the company's attention was beginning to turn to expansion of Gorgon now that construction has started on Barrow Island on the first phase, a three-train, 15 million tonnes a year LNG project.
While it is  premature  to start marketing the extra gas, signals in the market offer some confidence about demand, said Colin Beckett, Chevron's general manager for the Greater Gorgon area off the north-west coast, while declining to speculate on future commercial discussions.
 Gorgon has a certain brand value,  Beckett said.  There's a certain respect for Gorgon in the market so IÂ think if we expand that will be demonstrated in terms of people will be interested in taking more gas fromâ€ƒGorgon. 
Growing confidence in the market about the first phase of the project, its 40 trillion-plus cubic feet of gas resources and the strength of its shareholders will all play in Chevron's favour. Each of the partners, which include ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, markets its own share of LNG from the venture, Australia's biggest single resources investment, which got the final go-ahead for construction last September.
Chevron's three Japanese foundation customers, Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and Chubu Electric Power, took equity stakes in Gorgon as part of their LNG purchase contracts, reducing the US operator's original 50 per cent stake to about 47 per cent. Customers that signed up more recently, such as Korea Gas, Kyushu Electric and Nippon Oil, will not have direct holdings.
Chevron, Exxon and Shell may reach a decision in 2013 or 2014Â whether to add one of two more trains, potentially adding another 5Â million or 10 million tonnes a year of capacity. The venture has long envisaged the final capacity of the Gorgon venture would be 25 million tonnes per year of LNG, from five production units. That compares with 16.3 million tonnes per year at the North West Shelf venture, Australia's biggest LNG producer.
KEY POINTS
-Chevron has rethought is strategy of attracting Asian gas buyers by offering them a direct interest in the Gorgon project.
-Chevron is thinking about expansion.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"THE Gillard government's expected tax compromise on coal seam gas projects and the North West Shelf should pave the way for rationalisation of four $10 million-plus gas export plants planned for the port city of Gladstone.
CSG industry sources involved in talks with the Rudd government confirmed the federal and Queensland governments had been looking at ways to encourage consolidation of the four projects through talks on the proposed overhaul of resource industry taxes.
 All proponents have been saying their Gladstone liquefied natural gas projects are good enough to move ahead with on their own, but analysts say all four projects can not proceed together on existing timeframes to begin producing in 2014 or 2015.
It is believed the state and federal governments have discussed ways to encourage consolidation.
Macquarie analysts have suggested the government could offer a tax compromise as a carrot, while the approvals process could be used as a stick.
In the approval process governments are limited to imposing conditions on the projects, but commitments to provide infrastructure if some projects merged could be used to encourage consolidation.
The proponents of two of the projects, British giant BG Group and oil major Royal Dutch Shell (which has teamed up with PetroChina), met with Kevin Rudd the day before he was ousted by Julia Gillard.
They were expecting a deal to be announced last week.
The other proponents -- Santos-Petronas and Origin Energy-ConocoPhillips -- were not aware of any deals that were to be announced.
It is believed BG, whose chief executive Frank Chapman flew in to speak to Mr Rudd last week, is ready to give a final investment decision on its project once a suitable tax regime has been announced.
This could have made it, politically, a more important player for the government to deal with.
Santos, while as advanced as BG in project development, needs to strike more supply deals and sell an equity stake in its project.
It is understood Mr Rudd was about to announce generous concessions for the onshore oil and gas projects to transfer from existing state royalties.
Under the Rudd government's planned resource super-profits tax, coal-seam gas projects and the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project would have been taxed under the same regime

as miners. The compromise that was to have been announced would have moved them to the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax, which has applied to all offshore oil and gas projects, except those on the North West Shelf, since the 1980s.
It was reported Ms Gillard was taking a compromise to cabinet yesterday and that a deal could be announced today.
Yesterday, all four proponents declined to comment on the prospect of a deal being released.
One CSG source said there was a ``sense of inevitability'' about consolidation occurring in the industry.
Rationalisation is seen as necessary for a number of reasons, including savings that would be made by the proponents, Gladstone port logistics and a lack of availability of construction labour to build four LNG plants at the same time.
``A compromise is likely to be a precursor to consolidation in the coal-seam gas industry,'' RBS analyst Jason Mabee said.
``Despite what proponents say, we expect the projects to consolidate, but that won't happen until you get some of the uncertainty (about the tax rate) sorted out.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,2,"COMMENT
RESOLUTION of the taxation uncertainty surrounding the Queensland coal-seam gas sector would be a battle won for both the industry and the Gillard government.
 It would be, however, far from a conclusion to the super-profits tax war. Equally, it must be said the agreement would benefit the respective gas producers to varying degrees, including Woodside Petroleum, which is set to strike a separate peace deal for the North West Shelf.
The likely compromise appears to have been struck in government talks with foreign rivals BG Group and Shell, rather than Santos and Origin Energy.
For Santos chief David Knox, it is a moment of truth. Knox and his marketing team had all but sealed a long-term sales contract with Korea Gas that would have underpinned the economics of a second LNG train. Then the resources tax bomb exploded on May 2.
Since then, Santos has re-engaged with KoGas and talked to China's Sinopec to generate some competitive tension.
Through its 60-40 joint venture and sales agreement with Malaysia's Petronas, Santos has sufficient forward sales to justify a single 3.6-4 million tonne per annum LNG export facility.
But Knox desperately needs more sales to underpin a second train, which would lift capacity to 7-8mtpa, and improve project returns through scale.
In talks with possible buyers, Knox has said Santos is willing to sell a 9 per cent stake in GLNG worth between $400 million and $500m. But buyers may prefer a 20 per cent stake, which -- if Santos were to agree and Petronas approved it -- would reduce the likelihood of a capital raising.
With upward pressures on capital expenditure costs to build the LNG conversion facility on Curtis Island, the market has been fretting that Knox would tap shareholders again in a multi-billion-dollar dilutive capital raising.
It raised $3 billion in June last year at $12.50 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $12.59, and shareholders wouldn't be thrilled with another rights issue -- this time likely sub-$10 a share. If a tax compromise is reached, Knox will be racing with Origin Energy to sign sales agreements.

 The project, expected to cost $16 billion, is due to begin production in 2014 and will see PNG's natural gas sold across Asia.
Energy giant ExxonMobil has a 33.2 per cent stake in the project and operates it via its subsidiary Esso Highlands Ltd, while Oil Search Ltd has a 29 per cent stake in the project and the PNG government owns 16.6 per cent.
 The LNG project is vital to Papua New Guinea's economic well-being, with the potential to put Papua New Guinea on a sustainable economic growth path,  Mr Smith said in a statement following the meeting.
Other key stakeholders in PNG LNG include Santos Ltd with 13.5 per cent, Nippon Oil Exploration with 4.7 per cent, PNG landowners, who hold 2.8 per cent, and Petromin PNG Holdings Ltd, with 0.2 per cent.
 Australia is working closely with Papua New Guinea, providing technical and advisory support as Papua New Guinea establishes sovereign wealth funds,  Mr Smith said.
 Australia is in a particularly good position to assist Papua New Guinea using our recent experience with the Future and Nation-building Funds,  he said.
Mr Smith took over the trade portfolio this week after a reshuffle prompted by Julia Gillard taking over the federal Labor leadership and becoming prime minister.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"LNG SYDNEY, July 1 AAP - An agreement by Arrow Energy to acquire Gladstone liquified natural gas project Fisherman's Landing from joint venture partner Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd (LNG) has expired without renewal.
No progress has been made under the agreement since Shell and PetroChina made a takeover bid for Arrow.
 As a result, there was no value to shareholders in pursuing an extension in the term of the agreement, Perth-based LNG said in a statement on Thursday.
LNG said the expiry of the heads of agreement removed an element of uncertainty for other potential gas suppliers.
The Fisherman's Landing project could be the world's first coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas facility.
LNG managing director Maurice Brand said the company had been actively evaluating gas supply alternatives for the project and would select a strategic partner once plans were finalised.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"Any resource tax deal between Canberra and the big miners will create a playing field that is less than level.
IN THE final days of Kevin Rudd's reign he finally came to grips with the fact that he would have to do more than cut a deal with a small section of the mining industry (the coal seam gas operators) to get enough negotiating traction to even look like he was going to get some broad-based industry support.
 He appears to have chosen the high-profile mining entrepreneur Andrew Forrest (below) as someone who might be able to represent the interests of the rest of the industry. The points that the two men nutted out and were revealed by Forrest on Tuesday was not the final solution.
It was more a first draft that could be picked over by the various companies in the industry. It was not even one that Forrest would necessarily sanction. The exercise was more a recognition that many of the major elements of the tax were negotiable.
However, the guts of this blueprint contains elements that would not be acceptable to the likes of BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata.
Julia Gillard has wiped the slate clean. She is not looking at an industry-wide solution. The fact that the big end of the industry walked away from meetings with her yesterday happy-ish, at least with the fact that there is a genuine desire to find a solution acceptable to them, suggests plenty about where this is going.
It will send a message that profits from existing mineral projects will be grandfathered from the new tax regime and that the 40 per cent rate to be applied to super profits can be watered down either by lowering it or increasing the threshold at which it will apply â€” known as the uplift rate.
Treasurer Wayne Swan has also made plenty of noise over the past week that the revenue that would have been derived from this tax is not necessary to fill the budget hole because promised injections to areas such as superannuation, lowering the overall corporate tax rate and mining infrastructure can be revisited.
So there is an expectation that tomorrow an announcement will be made about some broad agreement about the shape of this tax â€” and one that will be palatable to the big end of town.
The question then arises about whether this will be acceptable to the rest of the industry â€” the thousands of small mining companies whose interests are not necessarily aligned with BHP or Rio.
The problem arises if projects are grandfathered from a more stringent tax rate that a two-tier tax system would emerge. Any tinkering with tax rates will, by its nature, produce aberrations.
The companies with prospective mines, which account for the overwhelming majority, will be subject to some kind of additional tax and those with established operations will operate under the old and more benign tax regime for most of their asset base.
Thus, those with producing mines and potentially without a super profit on existing earnings, will pay less tax than prospective players whose earnings will be subject to whatever new tax is imposed. The established players will have better access to cheaper finance. The playing field will not be level.
Gillard appears to be targeting the large and well-funded industry participants in order to get a compromise that the government may believe will rid it of the detractors.
It's the big players that control/fund the Minerals Council that have been making all the noise.
The focus on keeping the big players happy is just another move to divide and conquer â€” whether deliberate or not.
She has followed Rudd's lead of taking the coal seam gas players, such as BG, Origin and Santos out of the equation. From all accounts they will be happy enough with a tax similar to that applied to offshore petroleum projects.
Meanwhile, for the rest of the mining industry if existing projects are to be grandfathered the bulk of the revenue from this initiative will disappear and other promised goodies will be compromised.
But even a more electorally popular Gillard will not want to have the well-funded end of the mining lobby working against her in an election campaign.
She can afford to abandon much of the originally proposed super tax because it is not seen as her baby. All she needs to do as far as the electorate is concerned is to impose some new tax to claim a victory.
The unknown element is how vigorous the emerging miners will fight to ensure they are not disadvantaged by a less level playing field.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,3,"The State Government's approval of the Queensland Curtis Liquefied Natural Gas project will see 280 new houses will be constructed across the Western Downs.
Queensland premier Anna Bligh confirmed last week that coordinator-general Colin Jensen had accepted the environmental impact survey under strict conditions.
 These stipulations included the QGC run project facilitate the construction of the new dwellings in the Miles and Chinchilla districts.
Premier Bligh said that the project could be of great benefit to the region.
â€œThe Queensland Curtis LNG project could create up to 8,000 jobs and boost economic benefits in key gas fields and industrial regions,â€? she said.
â€œAs part of the Coordinator-General's conditions, project proponent QGC will develop an Integrated Project Housing Strategy to address the need for additional affordable housing.â€?
A spokesperson for QGC said that they would not be building the houses themselves while using as much local labour as possible for the project.
â€œIt's part of out job to facilitate the project,â€? he said.
â€œWe won't be starting up a construction arm to build the houses.â€?
However, environmental groups have declared the approval of the QCLNG project a potential disaster.
Environmental activist Drew Hutton said that the EIS had been approved despite the coordinator-general pointing out a number of severe environmental concerns.
â€œThe key criticism in Mr Jensen's report is that it is highly likely there will be degradation of the state's underground water system through the inter-connectivity of aquifers.â€?
The report states that long term affects of CSG extraction on the artesian basin are largely unknown, and the processes impact must be continually monitored.
â€œAll the monitoring in the world will be no good if the massive extraction of water from the Great Artesian Basin by the CSG companies leads to the degradation of the Basin itself,â€? Mr Hutton said.
Queensland Greens party lead senate candidate Larissa Waters expressed similar concerns, saying that projects approval was an environmental disaster waiting to happen.
â€œThe Queensland government is gambling with the future of our groundwater and the future of our food production for the short term royalties from gas exports,â€? she said.
Ms Waters said that QCLNG and expanded CSG would be detrimental to local communities and agriculture.
â€œOnce again the community and the environment come last, and the resource companies continue to run this state.
â€œThe state government's shortsightedness (sic) will be the death knell for local farming and for our water supplies.
â€œThat the Coordinator-General could approve the expansion of the gas fields in the Western Downs without knowing the impact on groundwater and farmland shows how pro-development, anti-environment and anti-community Queensland's infrastructure laws are.â€?
The QCLNG project proposes to pump coal seam gas from the Surat Basin to Gladstone's Curtis Island for liquefaction.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The head of Origin Energy's and ConocoPhillips's $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project, Todd Kreeger, is leaving it after 18 months in the job.
Mr Kreeger, who was appointed after ConocoPhillips struck its $9.2Â billion deal to join Origin in the project in late 2008, has been promoted to head ConocoPhillips's broader operations in Australia.
 He has been replaced by another American, Page Moxson, who was deputy CEO at ConocoPhillips's Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi until the group's surprise decision to pull out of the field earlier this year.
The change at APLNG comes at a delicate time, with a deadline to approve the development having slipped into 2011. Origin and ConocoPhillips are still waiting on government environmental approvals for the project and are also yet to secure any long-term customers.
The federal government's proposed resource super profits tax has also put a cloud of uncertainty over the project.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Woodside Petroleum has announced its replacement for outgoing chief financial officer Mark Chatterji, with Lawrie Tremaine winning the promotion.
Mr Chatterji, the architect behind the financing of Woodside's $12 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas development, announced he was stepping down earlier this year to return with his family to the United States.
 Mr Chatterji had previously been seen as a potential successor to Woodside chief executive Don Voelte and proved his credentials by ensuring Woodside was well financed through the global financial crisis,Â but his at times hard-nosed andÂ aggressive style put him at odds with some members of the financial community.
Mr Tremaine has been promoted from within Woodside, where he was previously one of two vice-presidents beneath Mr Chatterji in Woodside's treasury.
Mr Tremaine joined Woodside in 2006, having previously spent 17Â years in a variety of roles with aluminium company Alcoa.
With Mr Chatterji set to remain with Woodside until the end of the year, Mr Tremaine will spend the next six months serving as deputy CFO.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said Mr Tremaine would have  big shoes to fill .
 Chatterji was tough, exactly what was needed during the GFC when billions of dollars of funding was required,  Ms Brookman said
 The market thought he could not do it â€“ he did. 
Mr Voelte has been full of praise for Mr Chatterji, who helped Woodside secure $3.3 billion in debt while the global financial crisis was raging. Woodside also last year carried out an underwritten $2.5 billion equity raising.
With the company spending $5.7Â billion in capital and exploration expenditure in 2009 and committing another $4.7 billion for expenditure this year.
Given the recent strong record of Woodside's financing team, it was of little surprise that one of the senior treasury members beneath Chatterji was promoted to the CFO post.
Mr Tremaine will have some hectic years in front of him, with Woodside likely to need to raise billions of dollars more to develop its LNG project portfolio.
Beyond Pluto's current stage, Woodside is hoping to develop over the coming years up to three more LNG projects collectively worth tens of billions of dollars.
Woodside last month warned that the first stage of its Pluto LNG project would be subject to schedule delays and cost blow-outs if a strike by crane operators continued.
The company admitted late last year that the project was likely to cost 6 to 10 per cent more than originally forecast due to  lower than budgeted productivity .
Shares in Woodside closed down 1.71 per cent to $41.84 last night.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"RESOURCES ROW- Alternatives
The major oil and gas companies behind Australia's coal-seam gas industry could be better off under a petroleum resource rent tax, a leading analyst has found.
 JPMorgan's Ben Wilson said the net present value of Adelaide-based Santos's proposed Gladstone liquefied natural gas project could be $182 million higher under such a Â­regime than it was under the current royalty-based tax system. The coal-seam gas sector is rumoured to be closing in on a deal with the government to move to a petroleum-style tax regime to end the impasse on the proposed resource super profits tax.
Though the petroleum scheme â€“ which has applied to Australia's offshore oil and gas producers since the 1980sâ€“offers the same headline 40Â per cent tax rate as the proposed super tax, it also offers more generous allowances in cost deductions on building new projects.
Sunk capital costs can be fully Â­recouped before additional tax is paid under the petroleum tax, lowering the cost of project finance by Â­allowing for the rapid repayment of associated debt. In contrast, under the resource super tax, advance costs are depreciated over the life of the Â­operation.
Mr Wilson's estimates assume the government maintains its commitment to cut the company tax rate to 28 per cent from 30 per cent, a concession that may not survive the present round of negotiations.
His modelling suggests the net present value of Santos's Gladstone LNG project could rise from $3.9 billion under the present system to $4.1Â billion under a petroleum-type tax. Santos would also be slightly better off under an adjusted resource Â­super tax if the government agreed to lift the point at which  super  profits applied, from the long-term bond rate (currently about 6 per cent) to the long-term bond rate plus 5 per cent.
Under the original super tax proposal, the net present value of Gladstone LNG would fall to $3.5 billion.
The findings would probably also apply to other coal-seam gas-to-LNG developers in Queensland, including Sydney-based Origin Energy, multinational oil and gas giants Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group and Chinese state-owned PetroChina.
Mr Wilson said the LNG developers would be worse off under either of the proposed tax compromises if the government left the corporate tax rate at 30 per cent.
The industry's familiarity with the workings of the petroleum tax meant it was likely to be welcomed by oil and gas companies and their customers and backers.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"HENRY BRISBANE, July 2 AAP - Queensland Premier Anna Bligh says changes to Canberra's mining tax regime are a relief and will help the state's fledging liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry.
Ms Bligh, who was critical of aspects of the Rudd government's resource super profits tax, said the compromise brokered by new Prime Minister Julia Gillard was good news for Queensland.
 Ms Gillard on Friday announced the new regime, scrapping the Rudd government's 40 per cent tax on the mining industry and replacing it with a 30 per cent levy that will affect a smaller number of companies.
The new tax will affect just 320 companies instead of 2,500, and will be confined to iron ore and coal.
Ms Bligh said the new arrangements, and the application of the petroleum resource rent tax for gas projects like LNG, would see taxpayers get their fair share while ensuring the resources industry remained strong.
 Today's decision by the Prime Minister Julia Gillard to recognise the special position of the fledgling LNG industry is certainly welcome in Queensland,  Ms Bligh said.
 Since the mining tax was proposed by the federal government, the Queensland government has consistently highlighted the fact that the LNG industry in Queensland is at a crucial stage of its development.
 The fact that it has received special attention as part of the negotiations is a great result for Queensland. 
She said she was relieved the tax stoush had been resolved.
 Frankly, it's a relief to have this issue behind us. We can now move full steam ahead with projects like LNG in Gladstone and Ernest Henry copper mine in Mt Isa. 
Earlier, in response to Ms Gillard's tax compromise, Xstrata said it would resume its $400 million expansion of its Ernest Henry mine.
The mining giant suspended the project in response to the Rudd government's original tax plan.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"The Federal Government has agreed major concessions with the mining industry in a redesign of its controversial super profits tax.
The changes, announced by Prime Minister Julia Gillard this morning, include reducing the headline rate of the tax from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.Tax renamed the Minerals Resources Rent TaxWill only apply to iron ore and coalIron ore and coal will now be subject to a new tax at a rate of 30pc instead of the original 40pcTax will kick in at the government bond rate plus 7 per cent, which would be around 12 per centOil and coal seam gas to be rolled into the existing Petroleum Resources Rent Tax and taxed at 40pcChanges mean the Government loses $1.5 billion of expected revenue
  We've been stuck on this question as a nation for too long,  Ms Gillard told a press conference in Canberra this morning.
 Today we're moving forward together... It's also essential we have a stable and a coherent Government and a positive basis for trust, and I believe we have established that this week. 
Today's agreement, after intensive discussions with Rio Tinto, Xstrata and BHP Billiton in Canberra this week, ends a two-month brawl with the resources sector which contributed to Kevin Rudd's ousting as prime minister.
Ms Gillard was keen to distance the rebranded tax regime from the old resources super profits tax.
 There will be a Government profit-based tax regime, but there will be no resources super profit tax,  she said.
 It will maintain Australia's standing as a competitive and attractive destination for investment. 
Treasurer Wayne Swan was quick to heap praise on Ms Gillard for securing the deal.
 I think it's fair to say that her intervention changed the tone of this debate and has led to this breakthrough,  he said.  It is a better tax for the consultation, it is a better tax for the negotiation. 
The revamped tax will now only apply to a few hundred companies instead of the thousands that would have been liable under its predecessor.
Former BHP chair Don Argus will head a consultation panel with Resources Minister Martin Ferguson to hammer out the final details of the deal.
BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have issued statements welcoming the new tax proposal, but they say there is still much work to be done on its design before it takes effect.
Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Mitch Hooke called a the deal  a positive outcome for Australia and the Australian minerals industry  but said there was still unfinished business  to be worked through.
The CFMEU mining union has applauded the deal, with national president Tony Maher calling it a  huge win  for the community.
The Government says the price of iron ore has increased by 400 per cent and black coal by 200 per cent since the beginning of the mining boom.
The exploration rebate has been scrapped as has the measure that would have seen the Government share 40 per cent of the risk of projects.
Companies can also use the market value for their assets in assessing their taxable income, an area which was a key concern for the miners.
The tax was supposed to fund a 2 per cent cut in the company tax rate, but the changes now mean there will only be a 1 per cent cut.
However the boost in compulsory superannuation contribution from 9 to 12 per cent will remain.
The resolution of the stand-off with the big miners is likely to increase speculation that an election will be called soon.
The legislation for the tax still needs to go through Parliament but will not be introduced until after the election, and the tax is not due to start until 2012.
The Federal Opposition has vowed to block the tax but the deal with the industry is likely to put it under pressure to state whether it would repeal the tax if it came to office.
Deputy Opposition Leader Julie Bishop has accused the Government of a backflip.
 What was most disturbing about that press conference was seeing the co-authors of the original bad tax policy still spinning the same lines about getting the balance right and consulting further,  she told ABC2 News Breakfast.
 This just adds to the uncertainty. Nothing has been achieved at all other than the Government's backflipped on a number of core issues. 
Queensland mining magnate Clive Palmer was unmoved by the change to a 30 per cent tax rate and urged the opposition to stand firm in its opposition to the tax.
 These people just don't seem to learn, that's not how you grow the economy,  he told Sky News.  A tax never created any jobs or provided an income for any family. 
Greens Leader Bob Brown says the Government has made a  monumental backdown  which has served the interests of the big miners.
 In the future this is going to strip billions out of budgets, which would be going to the welfare of all Australians,  he said.
Senator Brown says the Greens will scrutinise the legislation when it comes before Parliament.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,3,"SHANE MCLEOD: As we mentioned earlier the tax changes also cover the burgeoning coal seam gas industry.
Companies will receive the same tax treatment as offshore oil and gas projects.
 The industry is expected to be worth $50 billion in Queensland and that state's politicians had warned that much of the economic boom would be in jeopardy if the planned tax increases had taken effect.
Our reporter Simon Santow has been speaking to the Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser.
SIMON SANTOW: Coal seam gas, it's obviously a very important industry to Queensland, Treasurer are you satisfied with the Federal Government's decision to transfer coal seam gas as far as tax is concerned to operate under the existing petroleum resource rent tax?
ANDREW FRASER: Well we support this decision and what it does is provide equity between oil and gas operators both onshore and offshore and in different parts of Australia. And so that allows the Queensland proponents to have certainty and therefore proceed towards making their own commercial decisions.
That's the critical point. We certainly welcome the issue being resolved. I understand that the industry views this as something which does provide equity, it does provide certainty and therefore allows the projects to proceed on their commercial merits.
We've been really clear from the start from day one and before in fact that the criticality for us as a Government was providing the ability for the world first coal seam gas to LNG industry that's growing up here and rapidly, to be able to move ahead and not be cruelled at the last hurdle.
SIMON SANTOW: Now even though under the regime of the petroleum resource rent tax the tax stands at 40 per cent, it's still a fair amount you believe?
ANDREW FRASER: Well the design that I've seen and that industry has been party to that I'm aware of makes a number of arrangements to ensure that that allows them to remain whole and to move forward. And so what we've always said as a Government, what the Premier and I have always said is that profit-based taxation can work. The evidence of that is Gorgon off the North West Shelf.
And certainly the design needed to be right and what we've got now is design that has the support of industry and therefore should be welcomed.
SIMON SANTOW: Now as far as the response from the coal seam gas industry is concerned would you expect them to honour all of the projects that they've been planning?
ANDREW FRASER: Well they've obviously got to make their own commercial decisions. And the critical point here is that they're moving at different paces and at different stages of moving their projects forward.
But the point to this whole debate was we didn't want to see taxation changes at the last being the reason that projects couldn't proceed.
Now there's obviously eight proponents. I don't think anyone in the industry believes that eight projects are going to proceed. But everyone does believe that the industry does have merit and that projects will be built.
And this means that we've cleared the hurdle rather than being cruelled at the last hurdle.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"IN the central Queensland town of Gladstone, booms and busts rest on the back of the resources industry. Smokestacks rise over the city skyline and, at the huge port, Australia's coal is loaded and transported to the world.
Gladstone is also the site of Queensland's fledgling $40 billion liquefied natural gas industry, which the state government expects will generate 18,000 jobs across the city of 55,000 people.
 But the federal government's proposed resource super-profits tax has led to an uncertainty about whether the anticipated massive growth of the town would actually happen. The expected announcement today of a compromise agreement between the big mining companies and the federal government has been a long time coming for the town's residents.
Last night, Gladstone councillor and chamber of commerce member Rick Hansen said he hoped the compromise would mean an end to the impasse and the beginning of a better future for his city.
``I'm happy it will all be cleared up,'' he said. ``My biggest priority is that we make sure we get that money into the areas that need it most -- that is the resource towns themselves.
``They need social and hard infrastructure.''
Gladstone Industry Leadership Group chief executive Kurt Heidecker said he would not speculate on the possible outcome of the talks. ``There's a lot of effort going into it -- government and industry,'' he said.
Local real estate agent Kathy Sladek said the uncertainty generated by Kevin Rudd's announcement of the proposed tax in May had given investors the jitters.
``He made the announcement on the Labour Day holiday (weekend). By Wednesday, all our enquiries just stopped,'' said Mrs Sladek, the principal of Gladstone's Property Down Under. ``(From March) up until then, I had to put on extra staff, it was so busy, then after that it just stopped.''
She welcomed the LNG industry, which would provide more and diverse employment in the town, and said it deserved special concessions as a burgeoning industry.
``The best way to put it is, if Rio (Tinto) sneezes, we all end up with a cold. More projects would get us out of this boom-bust cycle,'' she said.
``I just want it resolved quickly so we can just get back on with it.''
A spokesman for Gladstone Mayor George Creed said the proposed LNG project would have a ``massive impact'' on the town, but declined to comment on the politics of the resource super-profits tax. ``You can't put a construction project for 5000 people in a town without a major impact,'' he said.
He said regardless of the outcome of the mining tax, it was vital funding for infrastructure was returned to the resources centres.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"PAT Dodson has joined other law men and hundreds of native title claimants in court action against the Kimberley Land Council over Woodside's proposed liquefied natural gas precinct near Broome.
They have signed on to a proposed amended claim by the gas hub's most vocal opponent, Aboriginal leader Joseph Roe, challenging the land council's right to negotiate on behalf of traditional owners.
 According to court documents, Mr Roe is seeking leave from the Federal Court to amend his claim to include 16 other law bosses from the northern and southern traditions of the Dampier Peninsula song cycle.
It would also include more than 300 Goolarabooloo-Jabirr Jabirr native title claimants and people linked to those groups.
They claim the KLC had no right to negotiate with Woodside and the West Australian government on the development of the gas hub because in 2005 law bosses had made a unanimous decision against the precinct being anywhere on the peninsula.
They argue the land council did not therefore have their consent to sign a heads of agreement with the Barnett government and Woodside, which would deliver $1.5 billion in compensation to Aboriginal people. And the KLC should not have entered into a heritage protection agreement either, they say.
Under the amended claim, Mr Roe would be the sole applicant as a representative of the group. But in submissions to the court, the KLC has argued Mr Roe does not have the legal standing to sue the land council on his own.
Last month, the KLC suspended all negotiations with Woodside and the state government on an indigenous land use agreement while it dealt with the legal action.
Premier Colin Barnett said he was disappointed at the lack
of progress after a fourth dead-
line for Aboriginal groups to reach agreement passed on Wednesday.
Mr Barnett has said he would not grant further extensions for negotiations and would now consider whether to compulsorily acquire land at James Price Point, 60km north of Broome.
A spokesman for the land council said compulsory acquisition would take away the right of traditional owners to free and informed consent on the issue.
Mr Dodson refused to comment yesterday.

Professor Dodson is not an applicant in the court action. He is identified in court documents filed by an opponent of the project, Joseph Roe, as a ``law boss'' of the Yawuru people who was entitled to be consulted on the possible impact of the LNG gas hub on Aboriginal songlines in the area.

AS director of the University of NSW Indigenous Policy, Dialogue and Research Unit, professor Pat Dodson has a better job than most indigenous men and women in remote areas. While entitled to act on his views, it would be unfortunate for the unemployed and poverty-stricken families in the Kimberley if Professor Dodson, a Yawuru man from Broome, and others succeed in their legal challenge to the Kimberley Land Council's right to negotiate with Woodside and the West Australian government over development of a liquefied natural gas precinct near Broome.
 Faced with high unemployment in a region where three-quarters of indigenous people are aged 16 to 26, the KLC and its executive director, Wayne Bergmann, have taken a sensible, pragmatic approach to the proposed project, which would deliver $1.5 billion in compensation to Aboriginal people and create jobs.
But opponents of the hub, including Professor Dodson and hundreds of native title claimants, have signed on to an amended claim by a vocal opponent of the gas hub, Aboriginal leader Joseph Roe. The claim challenges the KLC's right to negotiate on behalf of traditional owners. It also argues that the KLC should not have entered into a heritage protection agreement.
The KLC has suspended negotiations with Woodside and the state government while it deals with the legal action. And the issue has not been helped by the meddling of affluent celebrities such as Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst, singers Missy Higgins and John Butler, retired judge Murray Wilcox and green groups such as The Wilderness Society.
WA Premier Colin Barnett's frustration is understandable after a fourth deadline for Aboriginal groups to reach agreement passed on Wednesday. It would be unfortunate if the government was compelled to compulsorily acquire the land for the project at James Price Point, 60km north of Broome. But the project, which would process at least 30 years' supply of offshore LNG reserves from the Browse Basin, is needed to strengthen the nation's economy. Well managed, it should transform the lives of local people from the margins of the economy to the mainstream, improving housing, health and education. If the gap between remote Aborigines and other Australians is to close, such projects need to proceed.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,3,"ENERGY
AGL ENERGY has unveiled a $123 million takeover proposal for small producer Mosaic Oil, which it hopes will create a gas storage business supporting the coal-seam gas industry.
 Mosaic shares yesterday soared 67 per cent, to 13Â¢, after AGL announced its indicative offer of 15Â¢ a share of 1.01 AGL shares for every 100 Mosaic shares.
Mosaic said it would talk to AGL - which is proposing a scheme of arrangement - but also advised shareholders to take no action.
AGL has already secured 12.8 per cent of Mosaic's register after entering into agreements with some of its biggest shareholders. AGL said these agreements were conditional on the Mosaic board supporting the takeover bid by July 14.
The managing director of AGL, Michael Fraser, said its offer was final and the takeover was designed to allow AGL to create a gas storage business from one of Mosaic's depleted gas fields called Silver Springs.
AGL has already entered into an agreement with
the Queensland Gas Company to turn the field into a gas storage facility, funded by AGL with some help from QGC.
QGC was bought by British giant BG Group for $5.5 billion in 2008 and is considered a front-runner in the race to export liquefied natural gas from the east coast.
Besides the Silver Springs field, Mosaic has several producing oil and gas assets in the Surat and Bowen Basins, also in Queensland.
A spokeswoman for Mosaic said its board had been locked in meetings for most of yesterday and takeover advisers had not yet been appointed.

The strategic value of Mosaic's Silver Springs fields for providing storage for ramp-up gas for the handful of liquefied natural gas projects in Gladstone has been recognised across the industry, with Credit Suisse yesterday suggesting other LNG ventures may also seek to secure the asset.
 Mosaic has been aware of the potential of the storage project for more than 18 months and has held talks  with all the parties that you would assume are interested,  chief executive Alex Parks said yesterday.
 It's certainly something that we have seen as a value proposition,  Mr Parks said in an interview.
In addition to BG, Santos, Origin Energy and Royal Dutch Shell are among companies planning LNG projects in Gladstone that need to manage the flows of coal seam gas that will start up well before the liquefaction plants are completed.
Under the non-binding proposal announced yesterday AGL is offering Mosaic 15Â¢ cash per share or 1.01 AGL shares for every 100Â Mosaic shares. It has secured pre-bid acceptances of 12.8 per cent of Mosaic shares, conditional on the target's board agreeing by July 14 to recommend the offer.
Mosaic shares, which had previously closed at 8.7Â¢, surged 67Â per cent to 13Â¢, just below the offer price. AGL shares edged up 2Â per cent to $14.99, valuing the stock offer at 15.1Â¢. Goldman Sachs JBWere is advising AGL, while Mosaic yesterday hired UBS.
Under the agreement with BG, AGL would develop a gas storage facility at the Silver Springs fields, to be operating by April 2011. The site, which would be partly funded by BG, would enable the UK firm to store gas from its coal seam gas fields before its Queensland Curtis LNG plant is ready to start up in 2014. The storage agreement would last for up to seven years.
Under an associated gas swap deal, AGL would use the gas from the storage site for its own domestic purposes and supply BG's LNG plant with an equal volume of coal seam gas on demand. The contracts between BG and AGL are subject to AGL successfully buying Mosaic. AGL declared its offer as final.

Australian coal-seam gas companies fear they will wind up with an inferior super profits tax deal to their international counterparts.
 As the industry continues to Â­finesse details of its settlement with the government over the contentious tax, local companies such as Santos and Origin Energy are concerned the industry's international players will win multibillion-dollar concessions to which the Australian companies won't be entitled, sources said.
Industry sources suggested foreign companies such as BG Group and Royal Dutch Shell â€“ key players in talks with the government â€“ have won agreement for acquisition costs to be included in deductible expenses under the new tax.
Such a concession would be worth billions to BG Group, Shell and other foreign coal-seam gas producers, such as ConocoPhillips, PetroChina and Malaysia's Petronas. Those companies would be able to deduct the $20 billion they have collectively spent on Australia's budding coal-seam gas industry, plus their development costs, before they would have to pay the new tax.
The concession would be near-meaningless for companies such as Santos and Origin, which have built their coal-seam gas businesses largely through exploration and do not have substantial acquisition spending to claim.
Unless a resolution is found, these Australian companies will end up paying the higher tax rate much earlier than their foreign peers.
The coal-seam gas industry has been on the cusp of a tax deal with the government for weeks. It is set to agree to a tax system similar to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, which covers offshore oil and gas production in Australia. The PRRT offers the same headline 40 per cent rate as the government's RSPT, but allows all capital costs to be recouped before the tax kicks in.
The ability to claim deductions for acquisition costs would be new to the PRRT, which does not allow for such deductions.
BG Group, which owns the most advanced coal-seam gas project, is expected to announce a final decision on its coal seam gas-fed Queensland Curtis liquefied natural gas project almost as soon as the new tax arrangements are confirmed by the government.
Analysts including Citigroup's Mark Greenwood and JPMorgan's Ben Wilson have suggested coal-seam gas companies such as Santos could be better off under a PRRT than the current royalty-based scheme, as long as the government maintains its commitment to trimming the company tax rate from 30Â per cent to 28 per cent.
Making acquisition costs deductible would be likely to make the value of the international companies' coal-seam gas to LNG projects substantially higher than they were before the tax reform plans were announced.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"LNG
ANALYSTS are divided on whether the new tax regime will be a boon to Woodside Petroleum and the owners of the nation's biggest working resource project, the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project and, in turn, see a dip in taxpayers' share of its profits.
 While sources close to the partners are presenting the changes as being tax neutral, some analysts have said if the project is able to use the market value of the project, calculated at about $60 billion, as its starting base for depreciation, no tax would be payed until around 2018.
Because it was not included in the Hawke government's offshore petroleum resource rent tax in the 1980s, the North West Shelf has operated under a separate tax regime and would have fallen under Kevin Rudd's resource super-profits tax.
Under Julia Gillard's compromise, the minerals resources rent tax, it will fall under the PRRT and have the option of a starting base for depreciation of either market value or book value.
Operator Woodside Petroleum, which owns one-sixth of the project, lists the book value of its stake in the project at $3.9bn, putting the book value of the whole project at about $23bn.
(Woodside owns more of the shelf's oil-producing assets, meaning its stake is not exactly one-sixth.)
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said that of the energy players, Woodside would benefit most from yesterday's tax announcements, which he said would add 7 per cent to the net present value of the project.
Woodside paid about $350m tax on its stake in the North West Shelf last year, meaning total tax on the project may have been close to $2bn.
One analyst at a major investment bank said that if Woodside could use $60bn as its starting base, the project would not pay tax for five years after making the transition to the PRRT.
``It is complicated to work out, but it is hard to see the government allowing that sort of hole in its revenue,'' he said.
Another analyst at a different investment bank said he believed company indications that the tax would be neutral.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE Federal Government put Queensland's coal seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas industry back on track yesterday by deciding to base the industry's new tax regime, an amended version of the petroleum resources rent tax, on the ``market value'' of the industry's assets rather than book value.
And the oil and gas majors welcomed the new approach, despite some analysts' caution.
 Under the tax changes, all oil and gas projects will be covered by the existing 40 per cent petroleum resources rent tax.
They will essentially be able to include the cost of buying assets - as in BG Group's $5 billion coal seam gas buying spree - when calculating capital allowances that can be offset against the tax, as such purchases will be covered by the ``market value'' of such assets.
At the same time, though the valuation methodology is yet to be spelt out, groups such as Santos and Origin Energy - which sold part of their assets to Petronas and ConocoPhillips respectively - should be able to value them by reference to selling prices rather than the cost of exploration and development.
``That will provide all the CSG groups with a level playing field,'' Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said.
Mr Roche said had the tax regime not been changed: ``We had been assured by the coal CSG-to-LNG players that their big projects would simply not have been viable The feedback from LNG companies is that these arrangements keep them in the game.''
Deutsche Bank analyst Damian Pearson said from the Government's statement it appeared a tax concession given to North West Shelf projects where Woodside has its major developments, had been abandoned.
But in a statement, Woodside said the Government's plan would provide certainty and would have ``no negative impact'' relative to its existing tax arrangements.
Queensland's LNG hopefuls, Santos, Origin and BG Group, all backed the tax changes.
``Now we're on exactly the same playing field we can compete evenly, and that was really important to us,'' Santos chief David Knox said.
``We pay between 40 and 50 per cent tax every year,'' Mr Knox said. ``We believe that to be a fair rate of return of tax and we will continue to do that in the future,'' he said.
Credit Suisse analysts said: ``Our valuation of Origin improves by 30 per share by moving from the RSPT regime to the PRRT type regime.
``Our view is that BG will announce a final investment decision on its Gladstone LNG project soon. We expect Origin to be able to pursue negotiations with potential buyers, with an equity selldown expected. We believe the quality and quantity of ORG's gas means it will be used in its own or someone else's LNG project.''

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"MINING PEACE DEAL - ASSETS
Coal-seam gas companies, including Santos and Origin Energy and mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, will benefit from a major concession to the new resources tax over the way existing projects are valued.
 Labor has widened the criteria for measuring how to value profits generated by old assets by allowing mining and energy companies the choice of measuring existing investments either by book value or market value.
Under the original resource super profits tax (RSPT) rules, old assets could only be valued at the accounting book value level, which had the potential to severely underestimate the price of investments, including BHP and Rio's ageing Pilbara iron ore assets.
BHP said it was encouraged by the change of design on the prospective tax issue, with companies able to transition projects into the minerals resource rent tax (MRRT) â€“ the compromise tax deal announced on Friday â€“ at the market value of the business with depreciation over 25 years.
 This is particularly important for the iron ore and coal operations which have been in existence for many years,  it said.
Being able to use a market rather than a book valuation for existing assets will be particularly important for projects such as Santos's Gladstone LNG venture, where there is a large discrepancy between the two valuations, analysts say.
Santos has a book value for its 60 per cent stake of GLNG of about $1.1 billion, but valuing it based on gas reserve multiples from recent merger and acquisition transactions could increase that figure to anywhere from $3 billion to more than $8 billion, substantially pushing out the date when PRRT would become payable. In contrast, the book value of Santos's Cooper Basin assets could be higher than the assessed market value.
Santos emphasised the importance of sorting out how existing assets are valued as the basis for taxation under the PRRT.
 Some of the detail is important, including determining the value at which projects will enter the new tax regime,  said spokesman Matthew Doman.
Origin Energy, which is also planning an LNG venture in Queensland, said it  particularly supports  the change in the government's valuation methods.
Looking for value
How valuations will work for existing resource projects
Companies can value their assets with either a market value or accounting book value.
Under the market option, companies can calculate past investments through a credit that recognises the market value of an investment written down over a period of up to 25 years with no uplift rate. The market option includes the value of the resource.
Alternatively, companies can opt for the written down book values of the project assets but this option excludes the value of the resource. The rate will be depreciated at accelerated rates over five years.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"MINING PEACE DEAL - OIL & GAS
Australia's fledgling coal-seam gas industry would benefit from the decision to apply the existing petroleum rent tax on the sector, which would clear the way for progress on over $50 billion of projects in Queensland.
 BG Group's $20 billion Queensland Curtis liquefied natural gas project appeared set to go-ahead now the threat of the resource super profits tax has been removed. And Santos, which was on the cusp of signing up a major customer for its Gladstone LNG project before the RSPT was announced, was expected to rapidly ramp up negotiations again.
Santos chief executive David Knox said yesterday the move would help the company move forward on its Gladstone project, which would now be on equal fiscal footing to the successful Western Australian projects.
 So now we're on exactly the same playing field we can compete evenly,  he said, adding that overseas investors would also benefit. Korea Gas, the world's biggest LNG importer, and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation were among companies considering signing up for fuel from the Gladstone venture, in which Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Berhad has a stake and which was due to be approved this half.
BG said the new tax arrangements  keep us on track to recommend the QCLNG project to the BG Group board for sanction later this year after we have Australian government environment approvals . BG has already secured Queensland state environmental clearance and federal approval is expected within weeks, potentially allowing for a final investment decision in July or August.
Yesterday's announcement confirmed growing speculation that the uproar from the coal-seam gas industry about the RSPT would be addressed by uniting the whole petroleum industry under the petroleum tax, which currently only applies to offshore projects.
The petroleum tax, while levied at 40 per cent, offered more generous allowances in cost deductions than the RSPT and immediate expensing for all expenditure.
Placing the coal-seam gas industry under the petroleum tax was  a significant step forward in fiscal certainty  for Santos, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch commented.  While not quite as attractive as the current royalty regime, [the petroleum tax] is still far superior to RSPT. 
Merrill estimated the petroleum tax regime would reduce Santos's net present value by about 2 per cent and cut the rate of return on the Gladstone project by just 1 percentage point.
Origin Energy, which was planning a rival LNG project with US firm ConocoPhillips, would now be able to pursue customer offtake accords and the sale of a stake in the project, Credit Suisse analyst Sandra McCullagh said. She estimated Origin would not start paying tax for its LNG project until the 14th year after start-up.
The news of the petroleum tax improved Credit Suisse's valuation of Origin by 30 cents per share.
Moving the onshore petroleum industry to the PRRT  provides a level of certainty that was not provided by the proposed RSPT regime , Origin managing director Grant King said on Friday. He added that  important details  on how the petroleum tax would apply to onshore projects had still to be resolved, including valuation methods.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"As Santos ponders a final investment decision on its liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone, the switch from the proposed resource super profits tax regime to the petroleum tax should provide more certainty for potential new joint venture partners such as Korea Gas and Sinopec.
But even if Santos sells down a 19 per cent stake in that project to a new partner, it will still face some funding uncertainty.
 JPMorgan estimates Santos will need to spend $8.1 billion on the capital costs at its Gladstone project, assuming it keeps a 41 per cent stake after the sell-down.
Selling the stake in Gladstone alone could bring in more then $732 million, while a fully underwritten dividend plan would add $1.7 billion and debt another $4 billion. But the broker thinks another $700 million in asset sales and $1 billion from a rights issue will be needed to plug the funding gap.
There has been market speculation it is close to striking a deal worth up to $1 billion to sell some or all of its assets offshore in Western Australia. Street Talk hears nothing is imminent but the process is certainly still under way.
Santos has been testing the market on its 28.6 per cent stake in the Barrow Island oilfield operated by Chevron and also in the nearby Chevron-operated Thevenard Island oil project which it bought from Royal Dutch Shell for $240 million in 2000 (ExxonMobil is also a partner in those projects).
Santos's other WA holdings on the market are said to include its stake in the Mutineer-Exeter and Legendre oil operations.
Its partners in those projects include Woodside Petroleum, Kufpec and Nippon Oil.
Macquarie Equities values Santos's WA assets now in production at $1.5 billion, or $1.82 a share, but that would also include its stake in the Apache-operated John Brookes gas field. The broker thinks its stake in the Apache-operated Reindeer gas project under development offshore in WA is worth a further $420 million.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Australia's rich natural gas reserves won't be exploited without government resolve for a carbon price, writes Andrew Clark.
'We have to start the journey and we have to start it bloody now.  No, this is not Prime Minister Julia Gillard announcing a minerals resource rent tax, but the managing director of natural gas major Santos, David Knox, referring to the political constipation that has blocked progress on energy policy.
 The stakes could not be much higher. Australia is the worst emitter of greenhouse gases in the world on a per capita basis, has potentially the biggest reserves of natural gas and yet is one of the lowest users, on a percentage basis, of natural gas as a fuel for power generation.
And, notwithstanding the new minerals tax, if the current impasse over an emissions trading scheme continues, a potential $220Â billion natural gas development and export bonanza, plus 55,000 jobs, for Australia in a world of ailing, debt-laden economies, could be undermined.
One shoe has dropped to break this impasse with the announcement of a new minerals tax. The government has excluded all commodities apart from iron ore and coal from the tax, scheduled to be introduced in 2012. Under the revised deal, the petroleum resource rent tax will be extended to cover all oil, gas and coal-seam methane projects onshore and offshore, and will apply at a rate of 40 per cent. The minerals tax will be levied at 30 per cent.
For Australia to move into an era of low-polluting electric power generation, gas industry promoters want a price on carbon. As the chief executive of Australia's peak gas body, Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, Belinda Robinson, said recently, climate change  has not gone away and Australia is still in need of an efficient and effective national policy that puts a price on carbon .
The Gillard Labor government wants to put a price on carbon, but not before a  consensus  emerges.
A carbon tax, depending on the rate, could support the construction of new baseload power stations that use gas, rather than coal.
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson says because gas is  a versatile and low-emissions fuel , it is  expected to play an increasing role in Australia's energy supply mix . But in the changed political environment now Julia Gillard has replaced Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister, discussion about that energy supply mix must broaden.
Local energy policy debate has, until now, been confined to a two-track affair. On one track is the argument that a mainly coal-fired electricity generating system can be cleaned up by  carbon capture , where poisonous carbon dioxide (CO2) fumes from burning coal are entombed beneath the Earth's surface.
This scenario is heavy on promise but weightless in reality because there is no proven technology that provides an economic mass system of carbon capture.
The Rudd government put all its energy eggs in the non-viable carbon-capture basket. This partly reflected concern about the fate of a number of federal seats sensitive to coal industry issues in the Illawarra and Hunter Valley regions of NSW and the Bowen Basin in Queensland, in the coming federal election, more than a rational energy policy.
The other track in the debate has been switching to renewables â€“ geothermal, wind, tidal, biomass, solar â€“ or nuclear. The first, renewables, cannot provide reliable baseload electricity. The latter is, despite powerful lobbying from uranium and nuclear power industries, not on the Labor government's agenda because of concern about cost, waste disposal, availability of the latest technology, public anxiety about the siting of nuclear power stations, and nuclear weapons proliferation.
That leaves natural gas. Australia has bundles of it â€“ so much that, according to some forecasts, Australia could leapfrog from sixth to first place in proven world reserves. Further, there is well-tried technology for generating baseload electric power using natural gas as a fuel. And it is far less polluting than coal â€“ according to some claims, 60 per cent less polluting.
Natural gas promoters say any significant shift to natural gas as a fuel for electricity generation would more than satisfy Australia's pledge to reduce CO2 emissions by 5 per cent to 25 per cent by 2020.  We are absolutely in a position to respond. We are ready to go,  says Santos's Knox. The time frame depends on political decisions.
First, the carbon price issue must be clarified. Last year the Tony Abbott-led Coalition and the Greens blocked enabling legislation for a carbon pollution reduction scheme that incorporated a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme.
According to Energy Supply Association of Australia CEO Brad Page, the industry needs  stable policy  and  we have got to resolve this in the next two to three years. 
The local outlook depends on  emissions constraint. As soon as you put in carbon constraints, the situation changes quite quickly . If there is no emissions constraint, coal-fired electricity is  significantly cheaper , although there is a higher capital cost for coal-fired plants, Page says.
Modelling carried out by industry players indicates that, under the current tax, pricing and policy regime, most of the forecast increase in electricity power generation will be taken up by renewables, which are mandated to account for one-fifth of power generation in 10 years' time. Gas-fuelled electricity generation becomes economic when it performs a topping-up role during periods of peak loading  to meet higher demand , as Page puts it.  There will still be gas [powered generators] built for very special purposes , but not to fill baseload capacity while coal remains significantly cheaper.
As the time between ordering a new gas-powered plant to commissioning the facility is normally six years, gas  is not likely to turn up in a hurry . Natural gas will definitely not dominate in the foreseeable future. It will continue to be back-up generator fuel.
 We really need carbon constraints  for the situation to change, Page says.
Industry figures normally cite a necessary tax of $20 on one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. This is what they mean by  putting a price on carbon . A carbon price could notionally bridge a gap of coal versus natural gas fuel pricing of $45 a megawatt hour of electric power generated versus $55 to $60 a megawatt hour.
Another contentious area is the role of natural gas exports versus domestic needs. The industry, not unnaturally, does not see it as an either-or situation, but a win-win, with positive implications for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
According to a Santos submission to the government,  abundant  natural gas reserves combined with reliable gas-fired power generation technology puts Australia in an  enviable position  to  maintain long-term clean-energy security. The opportunity is to transform baseload power generation away from high-carbon coal to low-carbon gas.
These  transitional  arrangements, which could last for more than a century, will  buy time  for advances in renewable technologies. They will also support the integration of renewable power generation, supply growing Asia-Pacific region demand for liquefied natural gas and emerge as a  major domestic economic driver , generating investment, jobs, export revenue, taxes and royalties.
Santos's Knox claims the natural gas sector is planning projects that will create 55,000 jobs and deliver more than $220 billion in investment. Natural gas, according to industry promoters, is Australia's NBT â€“  next big thing . Stretching in an arc from WA's Burrup Peninsula across northern Australia down to Gladstone on Queensland's central coast, is an array of possible LNG projects that could redefine Australia's role in global energy.
The International Energy Agency forecasts world energy demand will increase by 45 per cent over the next 20 years. Countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development account for 87 per cent of that growth. The gas share of that demand growth is expected to increase as the world becomes more carbon conscious. While Qatar's production growth will absorb much of that market, there's a strong appetite for Australian gas. And the rapid emergence of Queensland's coal-seam gas industry could mean a strong export industry for natural gas on both sides of the continent.
Australia's LNG exports in 2008 totalled $US9.9 billion, placing the sector fifth behind coking coal ($US34.5 billion), iron ore ($US33.7 billion), thermal coal ($US17.6 billion) and gold ($US17.5 billion). A near trebling in exports could see natural gas jostling with iron ore and coking coal as Australia's largest export.
But the industry's win-win claims â€“ income from gas exports will help fund a strong domestic sector â€“ warrant closer scrutiny. WA has an established LNG export industry, but Page says,  gas is almost impossible to buy in any form of contract in WA.  In fact, the state is host to the only new proposed coal-fired electric power plant in Australia. One explanation for this export-rich, home-poor gas scene is lack of a compulsory diversion plan, a prospect the industry abhors. Another is inadequate pipeline connection, as Australia still lacks a transcontinental gas pipeline â€“ something first envisaged by the Whitlam government's minerals and energy minister, the late Rex Connor, in 1973.
Ferguson says Australia has abundant gas reserves  to serve both international and domestic markets  and  through facilitating investment in the gas sector, the government is confident that Australia's domestic gas needs will continue to be met. Likewise, the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] has a role to play in ensuring competition in the sale of gas to the domestic market''.
 Australia's pipeline grid has expanded a long way towards Rex Connor's concept already and it will continue to expand over time in response to the market. 
No one in the Gillard government was forthcoming on details of a carbon tax last week. But this is not the only issue that could thwart the industry's vision. Despite widespread ridicule in traditional industries, renewables are staking a claim as the long-term answer to the looming power generation crisis.
The head of the school of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering at the University of NSW, Richard Corkish, says Australia  might want to aim for something better  than transitional arrangements for gas-fuelled electric power, although he acknowledges that renewable energy sources, including wind and solar, cannot generate reliable full baseload electric power.
Corkish calls for massive public investment and changes in the pricing system to turn the situation around. Australia, he says, has abundant sources of renewable energy â€“ wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, waves and tidal. He acknowledges that conversion to natural gas as the fuel for electric power generation would be  preferable to the existing regime  but it is still a fossil fuel, with a finite life. He says there's an argument that as oil peaks,  gas will also peak .
In the short term, however â€“  unless we take a serious decision to rapidly develop renewables  â€“ Australia  will need a transition  fuel, and that is natural gas.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"MINING PEACE DEAL- Oil and gas
Taxpayers will effectively subsidise some of the world's biggest energy companies for their $20 billion-plus in recent coal seam gas acquisitions under concessions made by the government to win industry support for their tax amendments.
 Changes to the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) allow companies such as England's BG Group, multinational oil major Royal Dutch Shell and Chinese state-owned company PetroChina to recoup the market value of their acquired coal seam gas assets through upfront tax exemptions when they bring them into production.
While the government is yet to clearly define what constitutes market value, tax experts said the figure was likely to be broadly in line, if not higher, than the acquisition prices paid during the oil majors' raids of the past two years.
The companies transitioning to the PRRT will then be able to fully recoup that market value, along with the capital costs sunk into the development of their assets, before they have to begin paying the new 40 per cent tax.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said the market value condition seemed to be at odds with the tax overhaul's original intentions.  It discriminates in favour of the foreigners that came in late and didn't take the risk [of exploration],  Ms Brookman said.
Acquisition costs were not deductible under the PRRT that currently operates in Australia's offshore oil and gas sector. The new allowance will only extend to those current projects moving onto the tax system.
Foreign companies have rushed into Queensland's coal seam gas fields in recent years, with deals including the $9.2 billion US company ConocoPhillips paid for 50 per cent of Origin Energy's coal seam gas acreage, Malaysia's Petronas $2.5 billion purchase of 40 per cent of Santos' Gladstone LNG project, Shell and PetroChina's current $3.4 billion offer for Arrow Energy's Queenland assets, and the $6.2 billion BG spent acquiring Queensland Gas Co and Pure Energy Resources.
Australian coal seam gas companies Santos and Origin Energy are also likely to benefit from the market value decision, due to the project values implied from the deals with their joint venture partners.
PKF tax consulting partner John Murray said it was likely that acquisition prices would be used as the market value of the coal seam gas projects.
 Until they clarify the rules on market value we're at a bit of a loss, but where you've got a third party buying in . . . the Treasury will have a hard time arguing that isn't a market price,  he said.
Mr Murray said that despite the upfront concession, in the longer term the government was likely to come out on top.
 If you rely on the government estimates, they are saying they will get $10.5 billion out of the combined PRRT and MRRT. That to me sounds like a win to taxpayers. 
Analysts have estimated that the coal seam gas companies are unlikely to be more than slightly worse off under the new tax regime than the old royalties system, thanks to the 1 per cent cut in company tax rate to 29 per cent and the market value concessions.
Pengana Capital portfolio manager Tim Schroeders said the concessions were understandable, given the government's interest in Queensland's potential coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas industry going ahead.
 I understand the motivation for doing it. The question is whether you see a disproportionate transfer of tax advantage to offshore companies,  he said.
 I would not mind seeing the tax advantage increase for Australian companies, but when it moves to offshore hands it's problematic.

PORT MORESBY, July 7 AAP - Australia and neighbour Papua New Guinea have reached a turning point in their relations as PNG begins to benefit from a massive Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project and an overhaul of aid effectiveness is launched.
 Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Stephen Smith made the remarks on Wednesday in Alotau in PNG's Milne Bay Province, where he leads an Australian delegation meeting PNG counterparts for a two-day talk session.
PNG, formerly an Australian administered territory until Independence in 1975, is booming from a prolonged resource boom and unprecedented political stability.
But PNG is going backwards in terms of social indicators in health, education, corruption, law and justice issues.
Australia's attempts to get PNG on track with a $450 million a year aid budget has been hammered by reports of ineffective and highly paid Australian consultants.
An independent aid review called for a rethink and this issue is one of the meeting's main agenda items.
 We are potentially at a turning point where we do need to take the opportunity to fundamentally reconsider the things that we've done in the past,  Mr Smith said.
 The Development Cooperation Treaty review is something we jointly need to consider.
 It draws out attention to trying to do too much, of stretching the budget too thin and we do need to focus on areas we make (aid) most impact,  he said.
PNG's ExxonMobil-led LNG project is hyped to double GDP with more than 30 years of gas sales to Asia. This has given PNG newfound confidence to move away from relying on Australian aid.
 It is quite clear the LNG project has the potential to transform PNG economic and social circumstances,  Mr Smith said.
PNG's Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Abal said Australia has a role in helping PNG but he wanted an end to what is known as  boomerang aid .
 If they want to help us build the Highlands Highway, fine, but we are asking that to be reflected in the PNG budget and for that money to be brought on-shore and spent here.
 A good aid policy is one that renders itself obsolete at some time in the future.
 We would be a very irresponsible government if we did not push this direction,  he said.
Mr Smith is accompanied by Assistant Treasurer Nick Sherry and Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance Bob McMullan.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ENERGY: Beach Energy is hatching plans to export as liquefied natural gas some of its shale gas in the Cooper Basin in South Australia and Queensland.
The Adelaide oil and gas producer yesterday signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Japanese trader Itochu to study the potential to develop and supply shale gas to a potential LNG project.
 It is understood one area the joint venture will target is the Gladstone market, where a host of majors are planning four LNG plants to export Queensland's coal-seam gas reserves. But the Cooper Basin is linked to all of the eastern states through pipelines, so there are other opportunities.
Beach managing director Reg Nelson said the joint venture was looking at mid-sized plants that could produce 1-1.5 million tonnes of LNG a year.
Shale gas was previously hard to release from the shale in which it sits, because the gas is unable to flow through shale to well bores.
But recent technological advances have changed that, in the process turning a gas shortage in the US into a surplus.
Beach believes its Nappamerri Trough shale ground, which straddles the Queensland and SA borders, could hold about 200 trillion cubic feet of gas -- or double the combined CSG reserves of Queensland and NSW.

CSG environmental impacts
What compensation can the Government offer for the permanent and irreversible alienation of our Great Artesian Basin?
The Basin is one of the natural wonders of the world and an integral part of life in the interior of Australia.
Our Governments have no right to potentially destroy this magnificent asset and I don't believe Australians would want this to happen.
No amount of money will right the wrong.
The Basin will, for all intents, be extinct and the native wildlife of this country which the Basin helps to sustain will be gone forever. So will the human presence.
The Aboriginies who populated this country for so long and relied on natural springs and wells should be horrified that the government is happy to allow coal seam gas extraction while it has not a clue as to the effects of this industry on the basin and the aquifers.
Every present day Australian needs to be aware of the insidious way in which our country is being handed, on a platter, to overseas concerns.
We fought two World Wars to keep this country for Australians and yet now we can't sell it off quickly enough or cheaply enough and at any environmental cost.

Taroom local risks all to save beloved hound
Taroom grazier Russel Hawkins dived fully clothed into water to distract a large buck kangaroo trying to drown his dog â€œ Yellaâ€?.
The incident happened at his home property â€œSpeculationâ€? while checking waters, his dogs had disturbed the roo who decided to hop into the turkey nest (earth tank) and deal with the offending dogs by grabbing them and drowning them.
This is common practice as their defence against dingoes.
Russel was unaware of the incident until he arrived at the top of the bank and spotted the roo in about a metre and half of water trying to drown Yella.
Realising he had little time to save his dog and without regard for his own safety flew into the water. He splashed water at the roo's head, yelled and traded blows until the roo finally let go.
Yella drew a few deep breaths and headed for the bank followed by Russel who did the crocodile slide up the bank.
Russel headed for home to change into dry clothes and other boots.
Once outside Yella acted as if nothing had happened but the other dog had injuries to his rear end. This occurs when the roo grabs the dog tips it upside down, holds it head under water and proceeds to bite the offending dog.
On hearing the story I thought how lucky Russel was not to have been ripped open by the roos hind legs. This story has a good end though, two dogs saved and I believe Fred Brophy from the boxing tent in Cracow is keen to sign him up

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"US oil major Chevron has announced its fifth gas discovery off Western Australia in the past year, boosting potential supplies for its planned $US20 billion-plus ($23.bn) Wheatsone liquefied natural gas development at Onslow, 1400km north of Perth.
Chevron said its Clio-3 exploration well, 150km northwest of Onslow, had returned 79m of net gas pay. ``We expect this discovery, together with our previous discoveries in this permit area, to underpin expansion opportunities at the Wheatsone liquefied natural gas hub,'' Chevron Asia-Pacific oil and gas president Jim Blackwell said.
 Wheatstone, from which Chevron plans to produce 8.6 million tonnes of LNG a year from 2016, is targeting a final investment decision in the second half of next year.
The permit the Clio structure sits in, WA-205-P, is two-thirds owned by Chevron, with Royal Dutch Shell owning the rest.
The find announced yesterday is the third from three wells drilled on the permit.
The first, Clio-1, was found in 2006 and the second in August last year.
The finds are part of the same structure, but classed as discoveries because they are separate reservoirs. The discovery was in 971m of water and drilled to a depth of 4.3km.
Chevron vice-chairman George Kirkland said the discovery underlined the quality of the company's Australian portfolio and the oil major's competence.
``We are continuing to invest in a significant exploration program to underpin the long-term growth of our Australian business,'' Mr Kirkland said.
The other recent discoveries were from the Yellowglen well in January, the Satyr-1 well in December, the Achilles-1 well in October and the Clio-2 well in August.
The finds, if they can be converted to reserves, would be used to feed both the Wheatstone plant and any expansion of the $43bn Gorgon development on WA's Barrow Island.

 Yesterday, Osaka and Shell signed a binding sales and purchase agreement for the supply of five years' worth of LNG.
``The remaining 20 years are linked to the final investment decision of the Prelude LNG project currently under development by the Shell group,'' Osaka Gas said.
A Shell spokeswoman said it was the first time a supply deal included the Prelude project.
Shell would not place a value on the deal, but previous deals suggest it would be worth about $17bn. The supply deal starts in April 2012.
Shell is targeting first LNG from Prelude, about 450km northwest of Broome, in 2016.
Analysts estimate it would cost about $US11bn ($13bn) to develop.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Chevron's latest exploration success in Western Australia has again turned the spotlight on the drilling campaign of its bitter rival, Woodside Petroleum.
Both companies are pursuing competing liquefied natural gas projects in WA's Carnarvon Basin, with Chevron's Wheatstone project fighting with Woodside's plans for a second and third train, or processing line, at its Pluto LNG project.
 The two projects are both competing for skills, equipment and customers, but Chevron's latest Clio-3 discovery has added to Wheatstone's momentum.
Clio-3 is Chevron's sixth discovery in the past year, a near embarrassment of riches given it had already agreed to incorporate Apache Energy and Kufpec's Julimar and Brunello fields into Wheatstone.
Woodside, led by chief executive Don Voelte, baulked at the terms being chased by Apache and Kufpec, and instead backed itself to find the gas it needs to expand Pluto with an unprecedented 20-well exploration campaign. That is now half complete, and the gas picture is still cloudy.
Woodside had four wells scheduled for the June quarter, the first of which had already been recorded as a failure when Woodside last updated the market.
Woodside's next quarterly update will be released two weeks tomorrow, and the fact it hasn't made any announcements about the progress of the wells suggests it is still waiting for the knockout discovery that will underpin Pluto's expansion.
If that's the case, it tightens the screws on Woodside to cut a deal on the gas assets of its neighbour and partner Hess, who is aware its bargaining position is improving.
Before Chevron's discovery was announced, JPMorgan analyst Ben Wilson had already noted he would need more certainty on Woodside's next set of growth projects â€“ namely the Pluto expansion and the Browse and Sunrise projects â€“ before he could justify an  overweight  recommendation on the stock.
And there are several factors outside Woodside's control that could hinder its progress on those fronts.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"US oil giant Chevron has made Â­another major natural gas strike off Australia's north-west coast, fuelling expectations of a fast-tracked expansion of its $20 billion-plus Wheatstone Â­export venture and increasing pressure on Woodside to agree to a gas supply deal with Hess for its rival Pluto liquefied natural gas expansion project.
The Clio-3 find is Chevron's sixth gas discovery in less than a year from its intensive exploration campaign in the prolific Carnarvon Â­Basin, where it is developing the giant Gorgon and Jansz-Io fields for the $43 billion Gorgon LNG project.
 Royal Dutch Shell has a stake in Clio-3 and said it was considering joining the Wheatstone project.
Woodside has also had some success in its record drilling program Â­under way in the Carnarvon Basin but is widely regarded as needing more gas supplies from third parties to meet its target of approving an Â­expansion to its $13 billion Pluto project at the end of the year.
US Â­independent Hess has been in talks with Woodside for months about gas from their jointly owned fields and from a separate cluster of discoveries held solely by the New York-based firm.
Chevron's string of discoveries leaves it well placed to start considering expansions of both Gorgon and Wheatstone many years before the ventures are due to start shipping gas to markets including Japan.
Chevron's Asia Pacific exploration president Jim Blackwell yesterday pointed to the potential for Clio-3 to underpin an expansion of Wheatstone, even though that project's first phase is still at least a year away from a Â­final investment decision.
Craig McMahon, lead Australasia energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Perth, said:  Chevron is in a pretty advanÂ­tageous position because they have Â­options in front of them, albeit none of them are that straightÂ­forward. 
Being able to move forward rapidly with expansions would leave Chevron better placed to capture LNG market opportunities in Asia and enable it to tie up labour and Â­engineering Â­reÂ­sources for years if workers and contractors could move seamlessly from the initial projects to the expansions.
Although Wheatstone is running Â­behind Gorgon in timing, it should be easier to expand because of the Â­environmental sensitivities of further construction on the Barrow Island Â­nature reserve, where the Gorgon Â­onshore facilities are being built. Gorgon is due to start LNG deliveries in 2014, and Wheatstone in 2016.
Chevron will need new environmental approvals to expand the 15 million tonne-a-year LNG plant it is building on Barrow, but will seek clearance from the outset for the full 25 million tonnes a year of capacity planned at the Ashburton North mainland site near Onslow that will host the Wheatstone project.
The first, 8.6 million tonne-a-year phase of Wheatstone also involves Apache and Kuwait's Kufpec, which will supply gas to the plant, and customers Tokyo Electric Power and Â­Kyushu Electric of Japan.
Shell is, however, clearly considering its options on Wheatstone.
Woodside has so far reported gas discoveries at the Martell, Eris and Noblige fields and is about to start drilling at the high-impact Claudius hub area further to the west.
The deep-water Clio-3 well in the WA-205-P permit found a 79-metre gas column.
Chevron has also made finds at Kentish Knock-1, Achilles-1, Satyr-1 and Yellowglen-1 since Â­August.

PERTH, July 9 AAP - Santos Ltd says it remains in talks about potential transactions for its $7.7 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project, amid speculation it is close to deals with Dutch, Chinese and Korean energy giants.
 Shares in Santos jumped $1.24, or 9.72 per cent, to $14.00, the highest since April 21 this year.
Analysts said the reports also boosted the broader energy sector.
Eastern Star Gas was up five cents, or 6.17 per cent, at 86 cents and Liquefied Natural Gas gained 1.5 cents, or 4.29 per cent, to 36.5 cents.
 Other energy plays benefited on the view that we're likely now to see more consolidation in the space,  CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said.
They also benefitted from federal government last week excluding coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas (CSG-to-LNG) from its new mining tax, leaving them subject to the existing Petroleum Resources Rent Tax.
Santos on Friday said it remained in talks with several entities about the Queensland project, which will convert CSG-to-LNG.
However, it said discussions were incomplete and there was no guarantee deals would be done.
 GLNG remains in detailed ongoing discussions with a number of parties in relation to potential LNG sales, equity in the project and collaboration between projects,  Santos said in a statement.
 These discussions are incomplete and there is no certainty that definitive agreements will be executed by the parties. 
A report in The Australian Financial Review (AFR) on Friday claimed Royal Dutch Shell was close to agreeing to buy a stake in GLNG of up to 35 per cent in a deal worth an estimated $2 billion.
An article in The Australian said Shell was competing with China's Sinopec and Korea Gas, which sought to buy an interest in the project of between nine per cent and 20 per cent in a transaction that could be worth up to $1 billion.
The AFR said Santos' talks with Sinopec and Korea Gas regarded long-term LNG purchase contracts worth tens of billions of dollars.
Both articles cited  sources .
Santos, which is developing GLNG in partnership with Malaysia's Petronas, has for many months said it was in talks with Asian parties about potential offtake and project equity sales.
Korea Gas was reported in June last year to be in early-stage talks with Santos about both matters.
A move by Shell would be unsurprising given it also plans to develop a large CSG-to-LNG project at Gladstone.
Shell is poised to fuel these plans by acquiring CSG producer Arrow Energy Ltd in a $3.4 billion joint deal with PetroChina that requires Arrow shareholder approval at a meeting on Wednesday.
Australia was central to Shell's plan to increase its LNG capacity by about 40 per cent to 26 million tonnes per annum by 2015, chief executive Peter Voser said in March.
Britain's BG Group and an Origin Energy Ltd/ConocoPhillips joint venture are also planning multi-billion dollar CSG-to-LNG developments at Gladstone, so it's widely expected consolidation will occur in the space, meaning less infrastructure may be required.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"IT'S no secret that Santos boss David Knox is pushing to sell up to 20 per cent of the Gladstone LNG project in Queensland as part of a major gas offtake agreement. The two known parties it has been speaking with are Korea Gas and Sinopec. To date it has appeared more likely that Knox would strike a deal with Sinopec, but last night there was speculation that Royal Dutch/Shell would be the buyer. The multinational recently jointly bid for coal-seam gas player Arrow Energy with PetroChina. The speculation was greeted with bemusement by some industry watchers but others are adamant there was some form of dalliance, with Shell proposing to merge the Arrow and GLNG projects. Through its 60-40 joint venture and sales agreement with Malaysia's Petronas, Santos has sufficient forward sales to justify a single 3.6-4 million tonne per annum LNG export facility.

Banpu last week used a similar move on Centennial Coal and GSJBW analysts reckon OZ could too, tipping the cashed-up miner to possibly make an offer of about $800m for the rest of Sandfire by year's end. The tip came after OZ last week paid $100m, or about $3.88 a share, for its stake. But GSJBW says OZ could offer $7.68 a share -- an 85 per cent premium to Sandfire's soaring share price -- for what it doesn't own. After Sandfire's 6.4 per cent rise yesterday, OZ has booked a profit of about $7m from its investment. But Stock Resource believes OZ could have other uses for its cash, tipping it as one of six bidders alongside Chinese parties to be shortlisted by Teck and private prospector Rudy Gomez for the Carrapateena copper project in South Australia.
First day of trade
BORAL'S new institutional investors had a tough first day at the office yesterday, losing about 5 per cent of their investment. Boral this week sold 5.5 million new shares after 92 per cent of its institutional backers took up their rights at $4.10 as part of the building supplier's $490m equity injection underwritten by UBS. The new guys got in at $4.65 after a bookbuild of the leftovers. CEO Mark Selway cheered the news; unfortunately, the market did not, with Boral slumping more than 10 per cent to $4.40 in its first day of trade since Tuesday's announcement. That is some 6 per cent below the theoretical rights price (TERP), which is perhaps an indication of hedge funds shorting the stock ahead of the retail component that is likely to deliver a significant shortfall.
All aboard for QR
THE state economy may be moribund but at least there's a little fillip from all the bankers, miners and financiers fighting for a piece of the privatisation action. Australian Rail Track Corp yesterday confirmed what The Australian's Matt Stevens revealed a couple of months ago: it had joined the mining consortium's $4.8bn bid for Queensland Rail's below-track network. On Monday, indicative bids were lodged with RBS for Port of Brisbane, the nation's third-busiest container port. It's a great asset but one unlikely to be sold for the book value of $2.5bn. The 2010 EBITDA is likely to be $125m-$135m and even a generous 15 times EBITDA multiple produces a $2bn figure. The three main bidders are the Credit Suisse-advised team of Global Infrastructure Partners, Queensland Investment Corp and Macquarie Capital, and then a syndicate of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and UniSuper. The third is NZ investors HRL Morrison and Infratil.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Santos is on the verge of a multibillion-dollar deal with Royal Dutch Shell, Sinopec and Korea Gas that would usher in the long-awaited consolidation of Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas sector.
According to industry sources, Santos and Shell are close to inking a deal that will result in the international energy giant picking up a 30 to 35 per cent stake in Santos's Gladstone coal seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas project, worth an estimated $2 billion. Sinopec and Kogas, meanwhile, would agree to long-term contracts to purchase LNG worth tens of billions of dollars from the project.
 It is one of the first major resource deals struck since the federal government last week resolved its long-running dispute with the industry over the resource super profits tax.
Santos is understood to have Â­recently closed a data room over its projects, and negotiations between the companies are believed to be Â­ongoing.
According to the sources, Shell would become the operator of the downstream components of the Gladstone project â€“ which will process the coal seam gas into LNG â€“ and incorporate its own Curtis Â­Island LNG project into it.
Of the two projects, Gladstone is considered to have the superior site for an LNG processsing facility.
Santos, meanwhile, would retain operatorship of its coal seam gas fields.
Santos now owns a 60 per cent stake in Gladstone LNG, with Malaysian energy giant Petronas having purchased its 40 per cent share in 2008 for $US2.5 billion.
The Adelaide-based company has been trying to sell another 19 per cent stake in the project for more than a year, in a bid to secure a new customer for its LNG and reduce its funding requirements for the development.
Petronas is believed to have become concerned about the cash burn rate at Gladstone and the slow progress to date in securing another customer for the project.
Assuming the Santos and Shell projects were brought together, it would reduce the number of LNG projects planned for development around Gladstone from four to three and deliver on the Queensland and federal governments' desire to see consolidation in the industry.
There would then be three LNG projects planned for development at Gladstone: BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG project, the Shell-Santos development, and Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG development.
A deal with Shell would alleviate several of the concerns that have been hanging over the company and its project.
The deal would ease the burden on Santos to carry out another equity raising to meet its share of development costs at the project.
Analysts have widely been tipping Santos to have to raise around $1 billion, in addition to taking on debt financing, in order to meet its share of capital expenditure on the project.
Santos has been in talks with potential offtake partners for more than a year, without managing to secure the sales agreement that would underpin the development of a two-train, or processing line, LNG project.
Petronas has already agreed to buy up to 3 million tonnes a year of LNG from Gladstone, underpinning the development of the first train at the project. Shell has already partnered with one of the world's largest companies, PetroChina, over its Curtis Island project.
The pair formed a partnership earlier this year to acquire coal seam gas company Arrow Energy for $3.4 billion, with Arrow shareholders set to vote to approve the sale this Wednesday.
As part of the consolidation, Shell would introduce its own LNG processing technology to the project, replacing the Cascade LNG process, which had originally been earmarked for the project.
Santos had earlier been rumoured to be closing in on a deal with Kogas which would have resulted in the Korean company making a long-term commitment to purchase gas from Gladstone LNG and take a 19 per cent equity sale.
During the debate over the RSPT, Santos chief executive David Knox pushed out the final investment decision on the project from the middle of the year to the end of 2010 Analysts have estimated that stake could have fetched up to $1 billion.
That deal, however, was derailed by the government's announcement of the resource super profits tax.
The coal seam gas industry appears to have emerged largely unscathed from the tax debate. While it has been moved on to the petroleum resource rent tax, which charges a 40 per cent headline rate, the government has agreed to generous upfront concessions that will limit the new tax's impact on the projects.
The combination of the projects will ensure that the partners can go ahead with at least a two-train development, extracting added efficiencies and economies of scale.
The larger reserve base of the combined projects would likely be able to support a three- or even four-train development capable of producing up to 14 million tonnes a year of LNG.
That would put the development on a similar size to Western Australia's North-West Shelf LNG project.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"THE MARKETS
ENERGY stocks fuelled gains for a second day amid speculation that Shell was close to securing a 30 to 35 per cent stake in a Queensland liquefied natural gas project.
 And analysts say the rally might spill into next week after two weeks of losses wiped $101.8 billion off the value of Australian shares.
The S&P/ASX 200 Index yesterday closed up 39.4 points, or 0.9 per cent, at 4396.3, after a further strong lead from Wall Street overnight.
The Dow Jones jumped 120.71 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 10,138.99, after surging nearly 3 per cent a day earlier. The turnaround in sentiment appeared to stem from US custody bank State Street predicting that the US second-quarter results season, about to start, would be better than expected.
Locally, energy stocks rose 2.84 per cent but gains were broad based, with all sectors finishing in the black.
City Index Asia Pacific's head of dealing, Michael McCarthy, said speculation that Shell would bring equity and customers to Santos's liquefied natural gas project in Gladstone lifted confidence.
The deal would lead to a long-awaited consolidation of Queensland's booming coal seam gas sector, media reports suggested.
 That optimism seemed to spread right across the market,  Mr McCarthy said.
 Some of the sectors I'd expect to underperform actually did quite well. Consumer staples stocks, which we would normally see possibly pull back on a day like this as people move into the growth-related stocks, actually went up. 
Santos surged $1.24, or 9.7 per cent, to $14, Origin Energy firmed 42Â¢, or 2.8 per cent, to $15.50, and Woodside climbed 44Â¢ to $42.53.
The consumer staples sector rose 0.34 per cent, with Woolworths and Coca-Cola Amatil the top performers, rising 9Â¢ to $27.11 and 19Â¢ to $11.89 respectively.
The market had a bleak start to the week, hitting 4182 points on Tuesday. But on Thursday better than expected employment data and reports that euro-zone banks might be in reasonable shape buoyed investor confidence, breaking a nine-day losing streak.
Mr McCarthy tipped the rally to continue next week. Tuesday's low had almost hit the flash crash trough of 4170 points made six weeks ago, he said.
 That sort of double-bottom effect gives technical buying real impetus. It's no surprise to see the bounce we have seen over the past three days, given that technical signal, which a lot of people are trading these days,  he said.
 The Australian dollar has bounced off a low US81.60Â¢ level to right back above US87Â¢ and yet the sharemarket has not bounced nearly as far. If we are still seeing that effect, where people went off risk and are now putting risk back on, it would suggest that the Australian sharemarket has some catching up to do. 
"
AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"Rumours boost shares 10 per cent
SANTOS has moved to cool speculation that it is close to striking a multibillion-dollar deal with Royal Dutch Shell to consolidate their Queensland coal seam gas projects.
 The Adelaide-based coal seam gas hopeful told the market that its $8 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project remained in  detailed ongoing discussions with a number of parties in relation to LNG sales, equity in the project and collaboration between projects .
 These discussions are incomplete and there is no certainty that definitive agreements will be executed by the parties,  Santos said.  We will update the market as appropriate. 
While the rumours sent Santos shares up almost 10 per cent, the message from those close to both companies was that any potential tie-up was still a way off.
 Santos is planning a final investment decision by the end of the year. Shell's project would be two years behind,  said one source.
 The problem with this deal is how do you consolidate projects like that without one party giving up a lot to the other? Is anything imminent? I don't think so. If it does come, it will be some way down the track. 
One gas industry source suggested Santos had several  irons in the fire , saying that you could never discount the possibility of Santos and Woodside consummating a long-mooted marriage.
 That has never been completely off the table,  said an industry source.  Santos has a number of options and has been spending a lot of time in Western Australia. 
The talk in the Queensland coal seam gas sector is that while the window had virtually closed on consolidation, all parties, including BG and Origin/ConocoPhillips and the Shell-PetroChina joint venture, were talking to each other about collaboration.
Korea Gas and China's Sinopec have previously confirmed that they are also in the hunt to buy gas from the project and a potential equity stake between 10 and 19 per cent.
During the furore over the now-dead resource super-profits tax, KoGas said  the biggest obstacle in the negotiation (with Santos) is the tax problem .
Santos chief David Knox has maintained for weeks that a potential deal was  very close .
Santos and its 40 per cent joint-venture partner, Petronas, need to find a customer to support a second LNG train.
The Gladstone LNG project is expected to start producing 3.5 million tonnes of LNG a year from 2014, if a final investment decision is favourable. A second train would lift capacity to about 8 million tonnes a year and improve the project's economics.
The company is also awaiting final environmental approval from the federal government after the environmental green light in May for its Curtis Island proposal from the Queensland government.
Deutsche Bank analysts said a tie-up between Santos and Shell made sense.
They said it would take the risk out of the gas-LNG project in several ways:
â– It would provide an experienced project operator in Shell.
â– Shell would bring customers, such as PetroChina, which would significantly increase the likelihood of the second train.
â– The equity sell-down from 60 per cent tackled equity issuance risks.
â– Shell could offer gas resources from Arrow, which would derisk reserves coverage for the second
Gladstone train.
Santos shares rose $1.24, or 9.7 per cent, to $14 yesterday.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,3,"SANTOS remains in talks about potential transactions for its $7.7 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project, amid speculation it is close to deals with Dutch, Chinese and Korean energy giants.
Shares in Santos jumped $1.24 to $14.00, the highest since April 21 this year.
 Analysts said the reports also boosted the broader energy sector.
Eastern Star Gas was up 5c, or 6.17 per cent, at 86c and Liquefied Natural Gas gained 1.5c, or 4.29 per cent, to 36.5c.
``Other energy plays benefited on the view that we're likely now to see more consolidation in the space,'' said CMC Markets chief analyst David Taylor.
They also benefitted from Federal Government last week excluding coalseam gas (CSG) to liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its new mining tax, leaving them subject to the existing petroleum resources rent tax.
Santos said yesterday it remained in talks with several entities about the Queensland project, which will convert CSG to LNG.
However, it said discussions were incomplete and there was no guarantee deals would be done.
``GLNG remains in detailed ongoing discussions with a number of parties in relation to potential LNG sales, equity in the project and collaboration between projects,'' Santos said in a statement.
``These discussions are incomplete and there is no certainty that definitive agreements will be executed by the parties.''
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The end game for Gladstone's burgeoning gas precinct is finally under way, write Paul Garvey, Yvonne Ball and Angela Macdonald-Smith.
Any eventual coal seam gas deal between Royal Dutch Shell and Santos is expected to be just the start of consolidation in the sector, with Origin Energy and BGÂ Group likely to be next in line for rationalisation.
 Adelaide-based Santos on Friday confirmed it was in  detailed ongoing discussions with a number of parties  after The Australian Financial Review reported that it was working on a potential coal seam gas deal with Shell.
Industry sources suggested the pair were examining a deal that would bring Santos's Gladstone liquefied natural gas project in central Queensland together with Shell and PetroChina's neighbouring Curtis Island LNG development.
The deal would see Shell operating the project with a stake of as much as 35 per cent. The sources also suggested the deal would see Korea Gas and China's Sinopec enter the project as offtake partners, with the overall deal bringing together the resources, customers and technical expertise to rapidly develop a larger project at Gladstone LNG than currently envisaged.
Santos said the discussions with the unspecified parties were incomplete and were no certainty to be executed. Shares in the company rocketed $1.24 to $14 in response to news of the deal.
Sources close to the discussions said there was little chance of a deal being finalised soon, with Shell and PetroChina unlikely to be able to agree to any deal until they have settled their $3.4 billion acquisition of Queensland coal seam gas producer Arrow Energy.
Arrow shareholders will vote on that acquisition on July 14, with the deal not expected to settle until August.
Analysts yesterday welcomed the strategic rationale of the potential deal.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said a union which saw Shell assume operatorship of the project would relieve market worries about Santos's ability to deliver the $16.4Â billion project, noting concerns that shareholders had been lining up to exit Santos stock once a final investment decision on the project was made.
 This would alleviate a lot of that and I think give the Santos investment case a lot more longevity because you can then have faith in the development. Shell obviously brings a lot of project management skills to the table,  MrÂ Wood said.
Reducing its stake in the project would also substantially reduce Santos's financing commitments, reducing the likelihood of it havingÂ to raise more equity.
There is also the possibility that a combination of the Shell and Santos projects could eventually involve different equity stakes in individual LNG trains, a structure that has worked on other LNG projects elsewhere in the world.
Santos is believed to favour selling no more than 20 per cent of Gladstone, and is confident it will be able to snare another offtake buyer shortly.
Its existing 40 per cent partner in the project, Malaysian state-owned giant Petronas, has already committed to buy up to 3 million tonnes a year from the project â€“ enough to underpin the development of a first train or processing line.
But the company has been chasing buyers for a second train for about a year without success.
Santos has advanced well on other fronts, having secured what is regarded as the premier LNG site on Curtis Island, with the project's wharf sitting in protected water with minimal dredging and jetty requirements. Santos has also received environmental approvals for its development.
Any tie-up between Shell and Santos would intensify pressure onÂ Origin to pursue its own consolidation strategies. BG GroupÂ looks set to be the first coalÂ seam gas-fed LNG project toÂ receive a final investment decision and the company has excess gas sales contracts already in place. with buyers from China, Japan, Singapore and Chile.
Any deal is almost certain to again push back Santos's delayed timetable as Shell's LNG technology replaces the original Cascade process technology incorporated into the project's design.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ORIGIN Energy claims that it is relaxed about possible consolidation elsewhere in Queensland's liquid natural gas industry despite industry speculation that it may be forced into a tie-up with the British-based BG Group.
The Australian reported last week that South Australia-based oil and gas producer Santos was in talks with Shell/PetroChina's Arrow business about a possible consolidation of their LNG projects, which could become the largest of those proposed for the central Queensland city of Gladstone.
 While Santos is the most advanced of the four projects in terms of its government approvals, its major problem is that it has fewer customers signed up than the other projects, and at the moment has only enough to justify slightly more than one train.
BG Group, which took over Queensland Gas Co, is not far behind Santos in terms of its government approvals and has already signed up enough customers to warrant a three-train plant on Curtis Island near Gladstone.
While a combination of the Shell/PetroChina project with Santos is only being discussed in the context of two trains, Shell/PetroChina alone has the potential to have up to four trains, largely because it has substantial reserves of coal-seam gas in the Surat Basin of western Queensland.
But Shell/PetroChina needs to finalise its $3.5 billion Arrow purchase, while Santos is still confident of making a final investment decision this year.
Origin has partnered with Conoco Phillips in the Australian Pacific LNG project. Origin also has substantial CSG reserves but it is well behind Santos and BG in its government approvals and is not likely to make a final investment decision until next year.
An Origin spokesman said yesterday that the company remained focused on its own project rather than what was happening elsewhere in the sector, but analysts have claimed that the Santos/Shell move could become a ``game changer'' for the entire sector.
A briefing note from Citi said that while at first glance the Santos/Shell/Arrow move would appear to have negative implications for APLNG in that there would be fewer customers to sign up, it may encourage APLNG and BG to discuss consolidation.
``Whilst BG would benefit from a much larger (and higher quality) resource base, APLNG would gain from BG's LNG marketing expertise and portfolio approach to managing LNG supply,'' the note says.
``For Origin, CSG to LNG is a means of maximising the value of their gas, not necessarily creating it per se. For this reason, we would not preclude Origin from entirely selling out their interest in APLNG, if that was an outcome that balanced risk and return, time value and opportunity cost for shareholders.''
While Origin has the best gas resources in the region, APLNG (a 50-50 joint venture with Conoco) has yet to sign any significant sales agreements. In contrast, BG has struck a deal with China National Offshore Oil Corp and Santos with Malaysia's Petronas. Santos is understood to be close to striking additional agreements with China's Sinopec and Korea Gas which may see it sell up to 20 per cent of the Gladstone LNG project.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"If Santos and Royal Dutch Shell do manage to strike a deal to combine their Queensland coal seam gas projects, then Origin Energy's own development in the region begins to look very lonely.
A deal between Santos and Shell would leave two of the three leading coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas plants proposed for Gladstone in central Queensland with the right combination of customers, clout and expertise. The odd project out would be the Australia Pacific LNG development of Origin and its American joint venture partner ConocoPhillips.
 APLNG is trailing its Queensland rivals, namely Santos's Gladstone LNG and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG, on several key fronts.
Both Santos and BG have already received key environmental approvals from the Queensland government, a key and largely uncontrollable Â­hurdle that APLNG is yet to conquer.
Arguably the most crucial difference is on the customer front. BG, which appears to be opening up a Â­decent lead over Santos in the race to develop Queensland's â€“ and the world's â€“ first coal seam gas-fed LNG plant, has exercised its LNG marketing credentials impressively. To date, it has locked in major sale deals with customers in China, Â­Japan, Singapore and Chile.
Santos already has its current partner, Malaysia's Petronas, committed to buy up to 3 million tonnes per Â­annum of LNG from Gladstone LNG. Other key supply deals are expected to be struck soon, with Sinopec and Korea Gas rumoured to be poised to sign up as Santos' latest customers.
While Origin insists it is comfortÂ­ably working to its own schedule when it comes to marketing the gas, the fact remains that Origin and ConocoPhillips are yet to secure a single buyer. Without firm long-term sales contracts in place, LNG projects â€“ which can cost tens of billions to construct â€“ simply don't get built.
With LNG markets having firmly swung in favour of the customers on concerns of a potential glut in supply, not having firm customers puts a huge question mark over APLNG.
Of all the foreign majors that have joined the Queensland coal seam gas party, it is ConocoPhillips who arguably brings the least clout. While it, like BG and Shell, has got decent LNG credentials, ConocoPhillips has not had the easiest time of it since consummating its deal with Origin.
A string of top-of-the-cycle acquisitions â€“ including the purchase of its APLNG stake â€“ left Conoco overloaded with debt during global financial crisis, and it has had to cut Â­heavily into its capital expenditure budget and has pulled out of projects.
It has, however, remained firmly committed to APLNG so far.
Origin does have an advantage on some fronts. One, its reserve base is by far the largest of any of the Queensland coal seam gas proponents, a key point of difference in the bigger-is-better world of LNG.
Secondly, it is in strong financial health. Unlike Santos, which raised $3 billion in equity last year and would probably need to raise another $1 billion in equity if it stays its present course, Origin is cashed up and likely to be able to sail through any LNG development without being forced down the equity path.
Those factors mean it does have some bargaining strength at the negotiating table. For now, though, the market seems to be attributing little value to Origin's share of APLNG.
Credit Suisse analyst Sandra Â­McCullagh last week estimated the value of Origin's base business, Â­excluding any of the company's coal seam gas-to-LNG potential, at $15.41 per share. Origin shares closed last week at $15.50 after rallying strongly when the Santos-Shell talks were Â­revealed.
Even if APLNG failed to get off the ground altogether, Origin would still be all but certain to eventually sell its sizeable reserve base into one of the region's other LNG projects.
Obviously the market needs more convincing that APLNG is real and deliverable, and the obvious way to wake up the market lies with Origin's former foes at BG.
BG and Origin famously came within a whisker of an agreed takeÂ­over in early 2008, before Origin used the $2.5 billion coal seam gas joint venture between Santos and Petronas to renege on the deal.
An angry BG took its offer hostile, the English only conceding after Origin struck its own landmark deal with ConocoPhillips.
Since then the pair have shown there's no lingering ill will â€“ or at least not enough to get in the way of a good deal â€“ with the companies earlier this year striking an agreement that will see some of Origin's coal seam gas sold into BG's LNG project over its first few years of operations.
BG is obviously a fan of Origin's coal seam gas assets, and is believed to be open to a deal with Origin.
A combination would solve Origin's most apparent problem, giving Origin immediate customers. BG currently has contracted sales for more gas than it expected to produce at QCLNG, with the company currently pledging to backfill the gap with excess capacity from its other LNG operations.
Origin would also be able to catch up in the approvals process by piggybacking on BG's more advanced project. In return, Origin's Â­unmatched reserves position would help BG expedite plans for a rapid expansion of QCLNG. Suddenly four or even five LNG trains at QCLNG would look very deliverable.
Of course, the logic of combining the respective coal seam gas projects has been apparent for the best part of two years, yet there's still next to nothing to show for it.
The LNG projects when running will generate billions of dollars in revenues for decades, so striking the right deal is a hugely delicate process.
So how to resolve the impasse? One theory starting to gain traction is for the development of a so-called Egypt LNG model at Gladstone. That would involve one of the LNG projects becoming an effective hub for the other players, with the different LNG trains, or processing lines, having different owners depending on who supplies the gas. Coincidentally both BG and Petronas are partners in the Egypt LNG project which employs that structure.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman has raised the possibility of Santos heading up such a development, and Â­believes the Shell approach to Santos could be the catalyst.
Santos is believed to be assessing the merits of an Egypt LNG structure in its ongoing negotiations with Shell.
 The proposed move from Shell would clearly open up the door for a hub on Curtis Island where different parties have different equity in different trains,  Brookman says.
Under the Egypt LNG structure, the project would be effectively managed through multiple companies. Â­InfraCo would build, own and manage the infrastructure associated with the LNG liquefaction facilities, such as jetties and storage tanks. TrainCo, meanwhile, would own the actual liquefaction facilities. A separate TrainCo would be established for each individual train, with the exact equity stakes in each to vary depending on which companies supply the gas. Each TrainCo would then pay a tolling fee to InfraCo for the use of the shared infrastructure.
 This means that although Santos may not be involved in the latter trains it could still receive a utility-type return on all molecules processed on the site,  Brookman says.
Santos's site, which is considered the pick of the bunch on Curtis Island, has room for up to five trains producing a total of 20 million tonnes per annum.
There's no way at this stage that Santos's own reserves could support such a development, but a partnership with Shell or an open mind from Origin could change all that.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"CERAMIC SYDNEY, July 13 AAP - An Australian company that develops energy-efficient electricity generation units has won an innovation award in Germany.
Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd develops solid oxide fuel cell technology to provide low-emission electricity from natural gas and renewable fuels.
 It won one of three awards from North Rhine-Westphalia's economic development agency NRW.INVEST, for innovation, expansion investment and new investment, to encourage investment in the German state.
Out of over 11,000 foreign companies eligible for the award, Ceramic Fuel was selected the winner for its new fuel cell production facility in Heinsberg.
Thousands of Ceramic's new BlueGen machines are expected to be manufactured at the facility annually, creating 80 new jobs.
The BlueGen machine is the size of a dishwasher and uses fuel cell technology to convert natural gas into electricity and heat.
NRW.INVEST managing director Petra Wassner told the award ceremony in Dusseldorf on Monday that Ceramic Fuel Cells was producing the technology of the future.
Ceramic managing director Brendan Dow said the award was recognition of the potential of the product to make a  significant difference to electricity production and climate change. 
Ceramic shares were up 0.5 cent, or 3.03 per cent, at 17 cents at 1230 AEST.

The stock has fallen 19 per cent in the past 12 months, and is down 32 per cent since hitting its 52-week high at $1.23 in August. The stock has suffered as investors have become increasingly risk averse in recent weeks.
Last month Tap was granted an application for an early Supreme Court trial to resolve a dispute with gas customer Burrup Fertilisers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"A deal between Korea Gas and Santos for the purchase of liquefied natural gas from Santos's Gladstone LNG project in Queensland seems  inevitable  given the demand needs of the world's biggest buyer of the fuel, according to Wall Street research firm Sandford C Bernstein.
An expected LNG off-take deal by Kogas of about 2 million tonnes per year with GLNG would give Santos 4 million to 5 million tonnes a year of contracted demand for the project, enough to underpin demand for the first processing train plus a  good base  for the second train, said senior Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge.
 Kogas is understood to have been close to signing up for LNG from the GLNG venture before being put off by the the proposed resource super profits tax. Speculation about LNG buying intentions by Kogas and Sinopec has been central to expectations of a consolidation of Queensland's overcrowded LNG sector, centering around Royal Dutch Shell and Santos.
The decision to scrap the proposed RSPT and place coal seam gas projects under the petroleum resource rent tax regime  provides certainty for both buyers and LNG developers with limited impact on overall project returns,  Bernstein said.
The announcement by Santos's GLNG partner Petronas of a plan to build an LNG import terminal in Malacca adds to confidence about its agreement to buy gas from the project, the firm added.
Bernstein calculates that a one-train project will cost $US7 billion and a two-train project will cost $US13 billion. It estimates Santos can fund the first train by selling down its equity stake in the project from 60 per cent to 40 per cent and taking on additional debt financing. The second train could be financed through a dividend reinvestment program and additional debt financing, allowing Santos to keep its BBB+ credit rating, said Bernstein, which upgraded Santos stock to outperform.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina have finally secured the blessing of the Chinese government for their $3.4 billion acquisition of coal seam gas company Arrow Energy, just 24 hours before Arrow shareholders vote on the deal.
The offer, which is expected to Â­receive strong support from Arrow Â­investors at a shareholders meeting in Brisbane tomorrow, has been conditional on receiving approval from China's National Development and Reform Commission.
 While Shell and PetroChina are yet to announce the receipt of NDRC Â­approval, a spokesperson for PetroÂ­China confirmed the approval had been formally received last week.
 Approval has been received so the vote can go ahead as planned,  the spokesperson said.
It is not the first time Chinese Â­approvals have been received at the eleventh hour of a takeover bid. Last year, NDRC approval was secured only five days before shareholders voted on Yanzhou Coal's offer for coal miner Felix Resources.
The bid for Arrow, which was lodged in late March, received Â­approval from Australia's Foreign Â­Investment Review Board in April.
Shell and PetroChina were unperturbed through the bid by the wrangling over the government's resource super profits tax, which in its original form looked likely to hit the coal seam gas sector hard.
The amended Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, put forward by the government as an alternative to the super profits tax, is expected to have only a slight negative impact on the value of Queensland's coal seam gas assets.
Arrow chief financial officer Â­Graham Yerbury said concerns over the impact of the tax on Shell and Â­PetroChina had been overplayed.
 A lot of people got pretty excited about the RSPT . . . but to be honest it was never discussed or raised by the bidder, and we never saw any action on that front,  Mr Yerbury said.
Currency markets have also worked in favour of Shell and PetroChina. The Australian dollar has fallen 6.6 per cent after peaking at US93.3Â¢ shortly after the bid was launched, shaving more than $US200 million off the amount Shell and PetroChina will need to source from their US dollar-denominated treasuries.
Assuming the deal is approved, Â­Arrow shareholders will receive $4.70 a share for their stock, plus one new share in Dart Energy for every two now held in Arrow.
Dart houses Arrow's early stage Â­international coal seam gas exploration assets and is being spun off as part of the deal.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee has estimated the net asset value of Dart at 54Â¢ a share, adjusted for the company's flagged, upcoming $75 million capital raising. But he said the company was unlikely to trade at that level in the near term.
 A lack of cash generation or Â­reserves makes Dart problematic to value,  Mr Hirjee said yesterday.  In addition, Dart's assets are located in geographic regions with limited visibility for Australian investors, which is likely to warrant a discount in the near term in our view.

BRISBANE, July 14 AAP - Billions of dollars of Queensland coal seam gas projects are on hold for three months so Environment Minister Peter Garrett can study their environmental impacts.
 Mr Garrett has sought an additional three months to complete his assessments of the Santos and BG liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Gladstone and offshore at Curtis Island.
The extension will allow for comprehensive assessments under environment laws, and the follow up of deficiencies identified in the Queensland Coordinator General's report, which included potential damage to the Great Barrier Reef.
Extension of the deadline means the assessments, which Mr Garrett received at the end of June, won't be handed down until October 11, his spokesman told AAP.
 These are the first coal seam gas LNG projects that have been assessed under national environment law, and it's important that the potentially significant environmental impacts of this project on nationally protected matters are properly assessed,  the spokesman told AAP.
 This is the same approach the minister has adopted for other major development proposals. 
The Coordinator General's report, obtained by AAP, has identified possible environmental impacts because of the significant amount of water and salt removed from coal seams.
 I consider the strategies for managing CSG water as critical, as there is the potential for ongoing risks to streams, soils and landscapes, through inappropriate use and disposal of CSG water,  the report said of BG's Curtis Island project.
 I am concerned that the cost to future generations will be substantial should rehabilitation works associated with CSG LNG industry activities be ineffectively undertaken.
 However, I am confident that the EP (Environmental Protection) Act administering authority will require the proponent to address these matters in an manner that will protect current and future generations of Queenslanders. 
The report, which also separately assessed Santos' Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), states the Gladstone LNG proposal was not acceptable to the environment department.
 I am concerned about the discharge of brine and effluent into Port Curtis,  the report said.
 The proponent has failed to consider the full range of utility infrastructure provision options including ... cumulative impacts to the World Heritage Area values as a result of associated with multiple LNG facilities on Curtis Island. 
Comment is being sought from Santos.

GOLD COAST, July 14 AAP - The federal opposition has called for Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett to be sacked over checks that will hold up coal seam gas projects in Queensland.
 The federal government has asked two companies, Santos and BG, to revise environmental impact statements for multi-billion dollar projects at Gladstone, and offshore at Curtis Island.
Opposition climate change and environment spokesman Greg Hunt said Mr Garrett was mired in  catastrophes .
 We've seen almost every day, whether it's pink batts, green loans, the solar debacle, and now the coal seam gas bungle - another example of chaos from Peter Garrett,  Mr Hunt told reporters on the Gold Coast.
 Julia Gillard must commit - if she won't sack Peter Garrett today - she must commit that she will not have him in the cabinet after the election. 
Mr Garrett will spend an extra three months assessing the environmental impacts of the Santos and BG projects.
The delay will allow the companies to revise their environmental impact statements and address deficiencies identified in a report by Queensland's Coordinator General.
Mr Hunt said Mr Garrett had botched the environmental protection process surrounding the projects, centred on plans to convert coal seam gas in southern Queensland's Surat Basin into liquefied natural gas and export it through Gladstone.
 The real question is why has Mr Garrett taken so long to put these requirements in place,  Mr Hunt told reporters on the Gold Coast.
 We have seen delays in the project, an absence of the protection of the environment.
 Mr Garrett must make a statement today why he has delayed, and taken so long to get these assessments done. 
He said the opposition wanted to see the projects go ahead, but with the right environmental safeguards in place.
 This should have been done months and months ago, the real impact is delaying jobs, delaying protecting the environment and uncertainty for investors and small business people in central Queensland who hope to get the flow-on jobs.

Chevron said the Sappho-1 exploration well, about 140km northwest of Onslow, encountered about 75 metres of net gas pay.
  This is the latest in a succession of back-to-back discoveries that underscore our exploration capabilities,  Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Co president Jim Blackwell said in a statement on Wednesday.
 These discoveries will underpin the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. 
The $43 billion Gorgon project on Barrow Island, Australia's largest resources development, is a joint venture with ExxonMobil and Shell, while Wheatstone, to the north of the island, is wholly owned by Chevron and is estimated to cost about $10 billion to develop.
Chevron vice-chairman George Kirkland said the latest discovery would support the company's long-term plans to build a natural gas business supplying Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
Chevron has a 50 per cent interest in the permit that holds the Sappho-1 discovery well, while Australian subsidiaries of Shell and ExxonMobil hold 25 per cent each.

SYDNEY, July 14 AAP - Shell and PetroChina have succeeded in their joint takeover of coal seam gas developer Arrow Energy Ltd for $4.70 per share, after Chinese authorities approved the deal.
 The majority of Arrow shareholders (99.26 per cent) voted on Wednesday to accept the offer of $4.70 a share from CS CSG (Australia) Pty Ltd, a 50/50 joint venture company owned by Shell and PetroChina.
The shareholders also approved the demerger of Dart Energy Ltd, which will hold Arrow's international businesses and selected domestic assets, and list on the ASX as a separate company.
Under the demerger agreement, shareholders will also receive one share in demerged entity Dart Energy Ltd for each two Arrow shares they hold.
Implementation of the demerger and acquisition schemes remains subject to approval from the Federal Court of Australia.
The Federal Court is expected to hear the demerger matter on Friday and the share acquisition matter on July 29.
If the acquisition is completed, CS CSG will own both Arrow's Queensland coal seam gas assets and domestic power business, as well as Shell's Queensland coal seam gas assets and interests in the LNG project on Curtis Island at Gladstone.
Arrow said on Wednesday the final bidder conditions were satisfied when the National Development and Reform Commission of China approved the takeover bid and a waiver was received from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China.
 Shell and PetroChina intend to invest the funds required to further develop Queensland's CSG to LNG industry and progress towards a world scale LNG plant on Curtis Island subject to a final investment decision,  the companies said in a joint statement.
Arrow's directors had unanimously recommended the deal to shareholders, saying it aligns with their intention to separate domestic and international strategies, mitigates risk in a balanced way and builds ongoing value into the future.
Arrow shares closed two cents higher at $4.99.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"THE federal government has called on Santos and BG Group to provide more information on the environmental impact of their projects, meaning almost $30 billion worth of investment in Queensland's coal seam gas sector could be delayed for months.
Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett has written to both companies asking for extra information on water management strategies amid concerns by Queensland's Coordinator-General and local communities about the effect on the Great Artesian Basin, one of the few reliable sources of fresh water in inland Australia.
 Mr Garrett has given Santos and BG until October 11 to submit revised environmental impact statements, potentially pushing out both companies' final investment decision.
The letter follows a site trip to Gladstone and Curtis Island by Mr Garrett more than a week ago and meetings with both BG and Santos about their projects, where he expressed concerns about giving the projects the environmental green light.
The delay on a decision means it is unlikely voters will know the fate of thousands of potential jobs in Queensland until after the election.
Treasurer Wayne Swan last night moved to reiterate the government's support for the $50 billion liquefied natural gas industry in Queensland, a battleground state that Labor needs to win.
 It is well known that the Minister for Resources and I are two of the biggest supporters of the LNG industry in Queensland,  he told BusinessDay.
 We are acutely aware of just how important this industry is for jobs, growth and the community â€” and recognise the need to get this resolved quickly.
 These are large and complex projects and, whether we like it or not, we need to operate within the confines of the rules,  Mr Swan said.
While BG and Santos say they still expect to make their final investment decisions this year, it is a setback, particularly for BG, which was the closest to a decision on its $20 billion project.
A spokesman for Mr Garrett said the extra time was needed to assess properly  areas identified as deficient in the Queensland Coordinator-General's report .
Last month, Coordinator-General Colin Jensen expressed serious doubts after reading BG's 9000-page submission.  I am concerned regarding the potential for widespread, irreversible, serious environmental harm associated with the widespread application of highly saline and sodic water,  he said.
 I am concerned that the cost to future generations will be substantial should rehabilitation works associated with coal seam gas LNG industry activities be ineffectively undertaken. 
The Coordinator-General had raised similar issues with Santos's 13,500-page submission into its $8 billion project.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"More than $35 billion in coal seam gas projects will be delayed after federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett demanded more time to study their potential environmental impacts.
Mr Garrett is now not expected to announce his decisions on Santos's $16 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project and BG Group's $20 billion Queensland Curtis LNG development before October 11, a time frame that is all but certain to fall after the federal election.
 Mr Garrett is believed to be particularly concerned about the long-term impact that the coal seam gas production will have on artesian water Â­basins and the possible threats the emerging industry may pose to the nearby Great Barrier Reef.
The delay will be a blow for the Bligh government, which was relying on the projects to provide significant jobs growth over the next few years.
It will also hurt federal Labor's election campaign as it attempts to hold onto crucial mining seats such as Flynn, based around Gladstone, with a margin of 2.3 per cent, and Dawson, based around Mackay, with a margin of 2.4 per cent.
 These are the first coal seam gas LNG projects that have been assessed under national environment law, and it's important that the potentially significant environmental impacts of this project on nationally protected matters are properly assessed,  a spokesman for Mr Garrett said.
Approval from Mr Garrett's office is the final requirement before BG can make a final investment decision on QCLNG.
While the Queensland government has approved the environmental Â­impact statements of both Santos and BG, the state's Co-ordinator-General has raised several concerns about the potential side effects of the developments. The LNG plants will be fed with coal seam gas from thousands of wells across Queensland's Surat and Bowen basins. The wells work by Â­extracting water from the coal seams, altering the pressure and allowing the gas to flow to the surface.
The wells are forecast to extract up to 420 megalitres a day of brackish ground water, only slightly less than the entire average daily water consumption of Brisbane.
To date, the companies have suggested using the extracted water on crops, or treating it via reverse osmosis for eventual disposal.
But the Co-ordinator-General's Â­report raised concerns about the long-term impact of such extraction on the water table and waterways.
 I consider the strategies for managing [coal seam gas] water as critical, as there is the potential for ongoing risks to streams, soils and landscapes, through inappropriate use and disposal,  the report says.
Analysts had previously predicted that Mr Garrett's office would Â­approve QCLNG before the election, allowing the government to claim credit for a major new investment in the election campaign.
Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan said that while he and federal Â­Resources Minister Martin Ferguson were  two of the biggest supporters  of Queensland's budding LNG industry, the government needed to be satisfied that the project satisfied environmental protection laws.
 We are acutely aware of just how important this industry is for jobs, growth and the community â€“ and recognise the need to get this resolved quickly,  Mr Swan said.
Mr Garrett, who has toured both BG's and Santos's projects in recent months, advised the companies of his decisions on Monday.
The delay adds further pressure to the development timetables of both projects, which had already come Â­under stress due to the recent Â­resources tax uncertainty.
Both companies are aiming to be producing LNG by 2014.
While both had originally been hopeful of making final investment decisions by mid-2010 pending government approvals, Santos earlier this year said its investment decision would slip until the end of the year, in part due to the recent tax Â­uncertainty.
Santos is also trying to secure long-term customers for its project, with the company believed to be deep in discussions with major international companies Korea Gas and Â­Sinopec.
Santos spokesman Matthew Doman said Gladstone LNG could still meet its revised timetable despite Mr Garrett's decision.
 The minister has asked for further information that we will provide promptly,  Mr Doman said.
BG Group spokesman Mark Todd said the delay was a normal part of the EIS process.
 We've consistently said we will consider a final investment decision later in 2010 after we've received the required environmental approvals. Our position has not changed,  he said.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the news was unlikely to help Santos in its efforts to secure new buyers for its LNG.
 It's another hurdle that has to be overcome, and there's been a few hurdles already,  Mr Hirjee said.

Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett asked for extra information yesterday from both companies.
The Federal Government has now given the developers until October to address water management issues in their environmental impact statements (EIS).

 The main problem is that none of the companies have been prepared to even give those guarantees,  he said.
 It seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable ask to guarantee that you'll not be polluting groundwater or you'll not be affecting groundwater - those are the simple questions. 
Mr Hutcheon says it was wrong for the Queensland Government to conditionally approve the project in the first place.

 Farmer Heath Webb says the company approached him six weeks ago asking him to sign an agreement to allow for testing on his property.
He says farmers are concerned that if drilling goes ahead in the future it will contaminate the soil and water.
 This water comes from great depths so it's salty, got high levels of minerals, got high levels of hydro-carbons and also carcinogenic elements, which of course cause cancer,  he said.
 This water is almost just dumped next to the gas well.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"A DAY after the federal government froze $30 billion worth of investment in Queensland's liquefied natural gas sector comes news that Royal Dutch Shell's $5.7 billion Prelude LNG project has also suffered an environmental setback.
Shell's floating LNG project had expected a decision from Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett on April 30 but it was pushed back because the federal Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts needed more information about the project's greenhouse gas emissions.
 Now another delay, this time until the end of July, has raised questions about whether Mr Garrett is dithering or exercising due care in granting environmental approval.
Santos and BG were given an additional three months to provide information on their separate plans to build LNG projects on Curtis Island in Gladstone.
Mr Garrett issued the extension amid concerns by Queensland's Coordinator-General and local communities about the companies' water management strategies and a potential threat to the Great Artesian Basin.
A spokeswoman for the Environment Department said Shell's Prelude project was complex, and that this was the first environmental assessment of a floating LNG proposal in Australia.
 This is brand new application of LNG technology, and therefore the assessment of its potential environmental impacts is not something that can be rushed,  she said.  It's not unusual to extend decision due dates for projects that require a thorough understanding of new approaches or technology that have not previously been assessed under national environmental law. 
Opposition environment spokesman Greg Hunt said it was  inconceivable that so many projects are subject to delay .
 This is the second major project delay that has come to light in two days,  he said.
Shell is hoping for a final investment decision by early 2011, with a view to producing in 2016.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"FEDERAL Environment Minister Peter Garrett's decision to postpone a ruling on Queensland's two most advanced coal-seam gas export projects is being viewed as partly political -- designed to avoid fallout ahead of an expected election.
While some involved with the Santos and BG Group projects feel blindsided by the three-month delay on a ruling they were expecting this month, others said that once Kevin Rudd had been ousted they felt a decision could be delayed until after the yet-to-be called federal election.
 On Tuesday, Mr Garrett said he was pushing back a ruling on the two projects, which are expected to cost a combined $35 billion, until he received more information about impacts on the Great Artesian Basin and the Gladstone harbour, which is part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.
Both projects plan to source their gas from onshore coal seams above the basin, releasing millions of litres of water. The gas will be piped to liquefied natural gas plants on Curtis Island in Gladstone harbour.
Santos said it would answer all queries promptly, indicating it believed the questions from Mr Garrett's office were not too onerous. It had also said it was expecting questions from the minister before approval.
It is understood BG and Santos have had informal, but high-level, talks about how to answer the queries. The delay comes after Queensland Premier Anna Bligh gave conditional approval for both projects earlier this year based on assessment of Environmental Impact Statements by the state's Co-ordinator General.
Mr Garrett is querying items in the assessment that the Co-ordinator General had said were not satisfactorily resolved.
BG, which has the most advanced project, had been ready to give a final investment decision on its plant once it obtained federal approval, meaning the decision will now be delayed three months. For Santos, the delay means it could have more trouble securing customers it needs to underpin investment and early-stage talks to merge its project with that of Shell and PetroChina.
``While the long-term environmental impacts of large-scale CSM production present a valid concern for regulators, we cannot help but think there is a strong political element to Garrett's deferral,'' JPMorgan analyst Ben Wilson said.
Mr Wilson said the extension may be designed to show that Mr Garrett was conducting appropriate inquiries after Greens Party accusations that he rubber-stamped the Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia.
Industry sources pointed out the October 11 date touted by Mr Garrett would allow the dust to settle, for whoever wins, after an election many are expecting to be held late next month.
Another issue raised in the Co-ordinator General's reports, and pursued by Mr Garrett, was that questions on the cumulative effects of multiple LNG plants had not been properly addressed.
It is understood this was not fully addressed because when the EISs were drawn up, there had only been two advanced projects -- those of BG and Santos.
The delay is expected to help Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips, which expect state and federal government approval by year's end, to sail through the approvals process easier and catch up with the other two projects. This could give them a better position in expected consolidation of the industry, which is something state and federal governments have been encouraging.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"Bligh government insiders believe Canberra is putting its needs before theirs
FEDERAL Environment Minister Peter Garrett has stoked tensions with the Queensland government with his decision to put the brakes on the state's fledgling liquefied natural gas industry.
 Mr Garrett has already caused problems for the Bligh government with his rejection last November of the Traveston Dam in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.
Mr Garrett said he would delay a decision on the LNG projects at Gladstone and Curtis Island in central Queensland until October 11. He is seeking more information on the environmental impact of the projects, which were approved by the state government earlier this year.
The owners of the projects, Santos and BG, said the delay would not affect the projects and they were happy to work with the government.
While the Queensland government was outwardly reserved yesterday about his move to delay for three months a decision on two LNG projects, within the government there was some consternation that Canberra was attempting to build its own environmental credentials at the expense of the state. A sore point was that, as with Mr Garrett's decision to stop the Traveston Dam, the state received no advance notice of his decision.
But one source told The Australian that there was unlikely to be any surface friction between the two governments as a federal election was imminent.
The imminent arrival of the LNG industry has become a big issue for the conservation movement, and Greens leader Bob Brown last week visited areas affected by the industry in Queensland, where he called for a moratorium on its growth.
The concern among ALP strategists is that the industry could become a wider concern and an issue for conservation-minded voters in marginal seats.
The Queensland government is relying on the billion-dollar industry to keep its economy kicking over, with the possibility of 18,000 jobs, investment of $40 billion, an increase of $3bn in gross state product, and $850 million in royalties alone each year.
Treasurer Andrew Fraser said he hoped the outstanding matters identified by Mr Garrett could be resolved quickly, and the government was ``determined to see this emerging industry flourish in Queensland, but not to the detriment of the environment''.
``This has already been a two-year-long rigorous assessment process to ensure the highest environmental standards are met,'' he said.
The LNG industry will consist of up to four plants at Curtis Island near Gladstone, but it will also involve the construction of between 10,000 and 30,000 wells, primarily on the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane.
Gladstone is in the marginal seat of Flynn but there is general support for the LNG industry in the area. However, there is strong local opposition on the Darling Downs, largely from farmers.
Farmers' main concern is that the production of coal-seam methane -- the raw material for LNG -- has the potential to deplete underground water supplies in the Great Artesian Basin.
Ian Hayllor, a farmer from near Dalby, said coal-seam gas development should be halted until the impacts were determined.
``If the companies are guided by sensible scientific policy, we can probably have an industry that doesn't leave us with massive environmental harm,'' said Mr Hayllor, the chairman of the Basin Sustainability Alliance. ``Otherwise, the massive multinational companies will leave when they've extracted the gas, and the communities could be left behind with no water, contaminated water or contaminated land.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"BG Group and Santos have played down the impact of the deferral of a Federal Government environmental decision on their multibillion-dollar plans to turn Queensland coal seam gas into liquefied natural gas for export.
With both facing a tight timetable to get gas out of their proposed Gladstone plants in 2014, they indicated yesterday that they still hoped to make final investment decisions by year's end - allowing them to meet that timetable.
 Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett decided this week to defer his decisions on the projects, decisions many had seen as imminent, for three months.
Mr Garrett's office said he wanted more information on the potential consequences of the proposed coal seam developments, which will require the disposal of millions of litres of brackish water pumped from wells to liberate the gas.
He would also seek further information from the companies on any potential effects of the LNG plant developments, on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour, on the Great Barrier Reef.
There is no doubt the two companies, which were almost certainly hoping to see a decision ahead of any federal election will be disappointed.
But Santos and BG pointed out they had always seen federal environmental approval as their next hurdle.
And with Mr Garrett now required make a decision by October 11, they said final investment decisions should be taken this year.
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said he hoped Mr Garrett's decision would come swiftly. ``This has already been a two-year-long, rigorous assessment process to ensure the highest environmental standards are met.
``The Bligh Government is determined to see this emerging industry flourish in Queensland, but not to the detriment of the environment.''
Queensland's Co-ordinator-General Colin Jensen ticked off the project's environmental impact statements some time ago but expressed misgivings, identifying possible impacts from CSG water and its salt content.
He said: ``I am concerned that the cost to future generations will be substantial should rehabilitation works associated with CSG LNG industry activities be ineffectively undertaken.''
That led some observers yesterday to suggest that Mr Garrett's decision was to get the LNG projects off the agenda ahead of the election.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Chevron has notched up another discovery in the prolific Carnarvon Basin, and added to the already vast resources earmarked for its huge Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied natural gas projects.
Sappho 1 is the second find reported by the United States oil major in eight days and its seventh in less than a year off North-West Cape, where resources for Gorgon and Wheatstone are estimated at more than 50 trillion cubic feet.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett's decision to further investigate the impact of Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas sector is likely to complicate Santos's sensitive liquefied natural gas sales negotiations.
The Minister this week advised the two leading coal seam gas-to-LNG proponents, Santos and England's BG Group, that he would delay his decision on the two developments until October 11.
 Mr Garrett is concerned about the potential long-term impact of coal seam gas extraction on the Great Â­Artesian Basin and waterways, and has requested further information from the companies.
The decision came despite the Queensland government approving both projects and federal Treasurer Wayne Swan's and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson's high-profile support for the plans.
The request and delay is understood to have blindsided the companies, with BG having been hopeful of receiving Mr Garrett's all-clear as early as this month. Federal environmental approval was the last condition facing BG before it could formally approve its $20 billion development. Mr Garrett's decision has less immediate impact on Santos, given the company had already pushed out its scheduled final investment decision on its $16 billion Gladstone LNG project until the end of the year.
However, analysts said the ruling would add further uncertainty to the project.
Macquarie Research analyst Adrian Wood said the decision  clearly doesn't help  Santos or BG.
 We're producing quite a bit of coal seam gas already,  Mr Wood said.  While the proposed LNG projects would add significant scale to current operations, it will be difficult for the federal government to change the rules of the game at this late stage, especially given the state's approval. 
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the delay would likely push Santos's final investment decision into 2011, harming investor sentiment.  While we do not see delays in federal government environmental approvals to be a show stopper . â€Š. â€Š. we believe uncertainty from the delays is not helpful in securing new offtake agreements with LNG buyers,  Mr Hirjee said.
However, the delay for Santos and BG could help the region's third LNG developer, Origin Energy, make up ground on its rivals, Mr Hirjee said.
The Western Downs Alliance, which has been protesting against the developments on behalf of farmers and land owners in southern Queensland, was pleased with Mr Garrett's decision.
 They have no idea what the impacts will be on the Great Artesian Basin,  alliance spokesman Drew Hutton said.  There's no efforts to quantify the cumulative impacts of the developments. 
Santos shares edged up 8Â¢ to $13.90 yesterday.

Santos and BG Group have been caught off guard by the environmental reviews.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"Tests have found natural gas resources off the New South Wales coast north of Sydney could be double the size first thought, rivalling the massive gas reserve in the Bass Strait.
Advent Energy has a permit to explore for natural gas 50 kilometres out to sea in the Offshore Sydney basin and is focusing on an area 25 kilometres off Newcastle.
 Seismic testing has been positive and the company says new technical data shows the estimated prospective recoverable resources are much larger than predicted.
Executive director David Breeze says the area was originally thought to have 6 trillion cubic feet of gas but that has been revised to 13 trillion.
 If we are successful in what we are looking at, then we could have as much gas as the Bass Strait,  he said.
 The Sydney Basin is a gassy basin. That could be extremely significant in terms of the capacity for the reduction of CO2 emissions. 
The company has secured a rig from the Bass Strait to drill an exploratory well later this year.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,3,"Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett may have lost a friend in Anna Bligh, but he has got some agricultural and environmental runs on the political scoreboard in the lead up to the election with his announcement on Wednesday that he needs more time approving Santo's and British Gas' proposed coal seam gas projects in Queensland.
Mr Garrett will not make a decision before October 11 and said the companies need to provide more comprehensive Environmental Impact Statements to provide better solutions and answers, particularly on the potential long term impact of Coal Seam Gas mining (CSG) on the Great Artesian Basin.
 The projects in question are Santos' $16 billion Gladstone LNG project and the British Gas (BG) Group's $20 billion Curtis Island LNG project which have both been approved by the State Government, but as they involve gas for export, they also need to be approved by the Federal Government.
Cecil Plains farmer Stuart Armitage welcomed the move, but questioned if the time frame was long enough to get the answers needed before an informed decision could be made.
â€œIt's good because we're pretty pleased to see a politician willing to come out and say what we've been saying for a long time now â€“ that there needs to be a moratorium - we just hope it isn't an election stunt,â€? Mr Armitage said.
â€œBut the time he's given is still too short â€“ I'd like him to extend it to have a look at all the gas leases, perhaps he thinks three months is necessary, but I think you need more time to look at the science.â€?
The Santos' EIS which was rejected by Mr Garrett is 13,500 pages long.
This leaves Mr Armitage and other landholders and environmentalists to wonder how if the companies â€œcan't produce answers in 13,500 pages, then were they hoping to just slip it under the rug?â€?
Environmental campaigner Drew Hutton described Mr Garrett's action as restoring his faith in the democratic process.
â€œI didn't quite expect Garrett to be as courageous as this, and it shows that the level of accountability created by having state and federal government is working,â€? Mr Hutton said.
â€œI suspect the people who are advising Mr Garrett have realised just how huge this issue is and how much it exposes the government to problems down the track, but I think the Bligh Government has become blind to all these dangers.
â€œMr Garrett has asked the companies to devise a complete water management plan, along with how they plan to mitigate the impact and how they're going to deal with the briny water by-product as well as the cumulative impacts and the size and the location of the disturbances.â€?
Mr Hutton believes landholders and concerned parties will now concentrate their efforts on lobbying at a Federal level because the Queensland government has failed to negotiate.
â€œAnna Bligh's government is banking on these projects going through to be able to say â€˜we created all these jobs, we've got all these royalties, aren't we good, now vote us in at the next election.'
â€œI've been around a long time and Joh Bjelke-Peterson was nothing compared to what the Bligh Government has become.â€?

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"Coal seam gas projects to proceed
HUNTER coal seam gas projects are under no immediate threat according to Queensland Hunter Gas Pipeline managing director Garbis Simonian.
 Almost $30 billion worth of coal seam gas projects have been put on hold in Queensland due to environmental concerns.
The federal government asked companies Santos and BG to revise and resubmit their environment and impact statements and Environment Protection Minister, Peter Garrett, requested additional information on their water management strategies.
The concern is over the effect on Queensland's Great Artesian Basin but Mr Simonian said there were no such concerns for the Hunter at this stage.
 Not at this stage, no,  Mr Simonian said.
 The matter in Queensland is a little bit more serious than the media are making out because there is a federal election coming up and the matter will get delayed even further. 
Mr Simonian said the pressing concern for the Hunter was how Macquarie Generation was going to fuel the proposed $2 billion, 2000 megawatt power station at Muswellbrook.
 The worrying issue for the Hunter is what is going to fire the power station, gas or coal?  Mr Simonian said.
 Coal leaves a much bigger carbon footprint and gas should be the logical answer.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Japan's Inpex is picking up the pace on its $23 billion liquefied natural gas project in Darwin, releasing an environmental impact statement for the Ichthys venture with the aim of securing approvals by March.
Inpex and partner Total of France have delayed the timeline for Ichthys several times over recent years but are targeting a final investment decision (FID) in late 2011 and start-up late 2016.
 Earlier this month, Inpex announced a Â¥587 billion ($7.6Â billion) capital raising to help fund the project, one of several proposed LNG ventures in Australia that are competing for customers in north Asia.
While the equity raising hasÂ helped build confidence inÂ Inpex's commitment to Ichthys, doubts remain whether theÂ partners will be able to stickÂ to theirÂ latest schedule with some engineering industry sources suggesting the unofficial timing forÂ a FID has already slipped to the first quarter of 2012.
Softer gas prices in Asia after the financial crisis may also have triggered a re-evaluation of parts of the project in a bid to cut costs, said IHS Global Insight. The venture has yet to announce any LNG sales contracts.
The draft EIS, which is open for comment for eight weeks, will be closely scrutinised as the project will involve one of the world's biggest floating processing platforms in pristine waters about 200 kilometres off the Kimberley coast. It also requires about 50 subsea wells and an 885-kilometre pipeline to transport gas east to an 8.4 million tonnes a year LNG plant in Darwin.
Inpex, along with other offshore operators in Australia, faces the prospect of tighter regulatory scrutiny of its drilling following the blow-out last August at a PTTEP oil well in the Timor Sea which triggered one of the country's worst oil spills.
The Varanus Island explosion in 2008 and the disastrous BP well accident in the Gulf ofâ€ƒMexico in April have contributed to what Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson describes as a  crisis of confidence  in the industry.
Mr Ferguson is due to release an independent report into the Montara spill and has warned he will act promptly on recommendations to toughen up oversight of offshore drilling.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Paul Henderson yesterday promised a  rigorous, thorough and transparent  assessment of the project, originally planned for Western Australia.
Hitches over environmental approvals are already affecting three other LNG projects in Australia. Environment Minister Peter Garrett this week delayed a final decision on coal seam gas-based projects by Santos and BG until October, while Shell's Prelude floating venture is also stuck at the approvals stage due to a dispute over plans for handling CO2 emissions.
Inpex, in its draft EIS, has also refrained from making specific commitments for the 7 million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide to be emitted by Ichthys on average over its 40-year life. It cites options such as planting trees, storing carbon waste underground and purchasing offsets.
Ichthys, 24 per cent owned by Total, will also be one of Australia's biggest oil producers, with an expected 100,000 barrels a day of condensates and 1.6Â million tonnes a year of LPG.
The offshore fields hold 12.8Â trillion cubic feet of gas and 527 million barrels of condensates, but the figures may be reviewed.
The indebted Japanese government is unlikely to take up shares in Inpex's equity raising, diluting its stake to about 18 per cent from 29.4 per cent.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The delay of some major Queensland LNG projects is causing concern in the northern state, Paul Garvey and Mark Ludlow write.
Peter Garrett has picked an interesting time to revive his inner eco-warrior. But the letter that the federal Environment Minister sent to energy companies BG Group and Santos last week, in which he demands more information about the long-term environmental impact of their proposed coal seam gas projects in Queensland, is causing rapid and widespread ramifications.
 The letter put a question mark over the immediate future of more than $35 billion in investment. It is causing political anxiety at both a state and federal level, and igniting debate over what environmental footprint the massive liquefied natural gas industry will eventually leave behind.
Garrett's approval is the hurdle between BG and a go-ahead at its $20 billion Queensland Curtis LNG project, and the minister's deferral of his decision to October 11 is believed to have caught the company by surprise.
There was expectation Garrett would wave through the project, allowing Labor to bask in the glory of a major investment commitment in the middle of an election campaign.
Those expectations were, it appears, well off target. Instead, BG and Santos will spend the next three months trying to convince Garrett his concerns can be addressed.
Santos had already delayed its final investment decision on its $16 billion Gladstone LNG before Garrett made his decision. It can still meet the revised timetable of project approval by the end of this year if Garrett's clearance is forthcoming.
Santos is impacted in other ways that are harder to measure.
The Adelaide-based company is in the middle of a long-running process to secure long-term commitments from LNG buyers.
LNG markets are firmly in favour of buyers right now and the new uncertainty from Garrett will not do anything to enhance the bargaining position of Santos, which has only just begun coaxing back potential buyers scared off by the government's controversial resource tax changes.
The sheer size of the proposed investments and their importance to Queensland's economy has fed expectations that an acceptable compromise will be found.
Garrett queries the long-term effects of the projects on ground water through southern Queensland and the broader Great Artesian Basin.
The thousands of coal seam gas wells that will support the LNG developments work by sucking huge volumes of water out of the seams. The resulting change of pressure then allows the gas to flow to the surface.
The three leading coal seam gas projects (Origin Energy and US company ConocoPhillips are behind the third) will at their peak produce an estimated 420 megalitres of mostly brackish water every day, the equivalent of only slightly less than the entire average daily water consumption of Brisbane. Finding a home for the water should not in theory be a problem, given Australia's historical problems with water supply, yet there remain concerns about the long-term impact of such volumes of water production.
Peter Williams, managing director Australia for water handling specialist MWH Global, believes the projects will eventually be approved but only with attached conditions relating to aspects such as required water quality and site rehabilitation.
 The regulators are right to ask questions to satisfy themselves that the concerns of the community and the state and the economy are being met,  Williams says.
 They're obviously motivated to enable what is going to be billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to go ahead, but certainly it's correct to stop and say 'are we answering all the questions?'. 
The Queensland government for its part is prepared to approve both projects despite the state's Co-ordinator General raising queries over the water issue.
The Bligh government sees the coal seam gas industry as the platform for significant job creation over the next few years.
Senior Queensland ALP sources play down the impact of the delay on the party's chances at the next election, but one ALP insider admits it will take the sting out of some of their campaigning in the key mining marginal seats of Flynn and Dawson.
With more than half-a-dozen marginal Labor seats in Queensland, Labor will be looking to use any means it can to ensure it minimises swings against it in the crucial battleground state.
Flynn, which Labor is holding by a margin of only 2.3 per cent, was at risk before the decision, but Labor strategists are hopeful it won't count against them in the impending election campaign.
 So far it hasn't played out negatively in those seats,  an ALP source tells the Weekend AFR.
 If anything, these sorts of things help to reinforce the key messages. It's not such a bad thing for Chris Trevor [sitting MP for Flynn] to say he is going to keep fighting for these projects but you have to make sure you get the balance right [with environmental issues]. 
During the week the state Treasurer Andrew Fraser said he was confident the federal minister's concerns would be addressed by the two companies and the LNG industry would become a reality.
 The Bligh government is determined to see this emerging industry flourish in Queensland but not to the detriment of the environment. I hope these outstanding matters can be resolved expeditiously,  Fraser said.
But privately, the delay is annoying the Bligh government. It believes the delay adds to uncertainty surrounding the projects during the protracted resource super profits tax dispute.
There is no requirement for Garrett to consult cabinet colleagues before making such decisions. That may explain the surprising statement of support for the sector from federal treasurer Wayne Swan shortly after Garrett's decision.
It is understood the Bligh government was not told about the delay until just before Garrett's announcement.
Although the state government is disappointed with the delay, given it is basing the economic resurgence on the LNG boom, it does not want to cause a rift with federal colleagues on the eve of a federal election. The fact the decision is only a three-month delay for BG and Santos to answer environmental questions â€“ rather than an outright blocking such as last year's controversial decision on the $1.8 billion Traveston Dam project â€“ is another reason for the Bligh government to keep its powder dry.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"FARMERS' concerns over an experimental coal-seam gas plant in southeast Queensland have spread to the town of Kingaroy, despite results finding no ``unsafe levels'' of any toxic chemicals in local water supplies.
Residents from Kingaroy, Queensland's peanut capital, 100km north of Brisbane, met yesterday after the closure of Cougar Energy's pilot project on Friday, to demand the project be shut down permanently.
 Underground water supplies close to the project site were found to have trace amounts of carcinogenic chemicals benzene and toluene, believed to have leaked from the Cougar Energy operation.
Last night, Queensland's Environment and Resource Management Department director-general, John Bradley, said results taken from eight bores found only two samples with a detectable level of the chemicals, both within drinking-water guidelines.
``These eight locations are not the limit of the testing which will be done in this area,'' he said. ``They will be sampled with additional frequency and a wider selection of bores will also be sampled this week as a precautionary measure.''
Cougar Energy yesterday welcomed the test results, saying it hoped to ``continue with its innovative UCG (underground coal gasification) pilot plant and power station project''.
Coal-seam gasification burns underground coal to convert it to a gas, which can be used to generate electricity. Last week, it was revealed that the Queensland government knew for two weeks about a chemical leak in June but did not alert locals.
An Environment Department official was stood down.
But Kingaroy Concerned Residents Group chair Gary Tessmann wrote to Queensland Premier Anna Bligh yesterday, saying the testing regimes and environmental requirements had been ``ignored''.
``We ask you as Premier to take affirmative action on this project and close down this experiment permanently, before any further pollution occurs,'' Mr Tessmann said. ``This is the only action that will give local residents the confidence that they deserve in not having further pollution occur.''
Residents are also gravely concerned at the policing of permits, which they say have been issued for land within the town.
Additional sample results are still being analysed and are expected this week. Rural property owners within a 2km radius of the UCG plant, and 2km of Plantation bore, are told not to use water from their bores for human consumption or stock watering.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE Bligh Government finds itself in a very bad political position over what is looming as a critical economic and environmental issue. The ruling last week by federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett to stall a decision on two massive central Queensland coal seam-to-liquefied natural gas projects by three months was one of two things: blatant politics designed to earn Garrett some Green kudos or a rejection of the State Government's environmental standards.
Either way the State Government looks the loser and the public is less informed about the issue than it should be.
 Garrett's decision came just days before a second blow to Queensland efforts to extract gas from coal, when, on Friday, the State Government shut down Cougar Energy's underground coal gasification trial near Kingaroy after toxic chemicals were found in water from nearby bores.
Cougar's project is unrelated to the projects examined by Garrett, and uses a different gas extraction process.
But the shutdown has highlighted the political risks of the environmentally sensitive issue of developing an LNG industry in Queensland.
Twice now, this Federal Government has jumped in on critical development issues in Queensland - first killing off Traveston Dam and then calling for more information on the water issues in the Surat Basin coal seams and raising key concerns first highlighted by the Co-ordinator-General, Colin Jensen, and reported widely in The Courier-Mail.
It is not so much about what is known about the projects but rather the unknown impacts. The fear is they could be considerable.
Environmentalists argue that the Government's decision to declare the projects ``of state significance'' and putting them in the hands of the Co-ordinator-General was nothing more than a fast-tracking that has allowed it to grant approval over the schemes without the more rigorous environmental assessment than normally occurs.
That may be something of an insult to Jensen and his team because his reports are scathing of the companies' plans and their lack of detail.
The projects could well be the biggest environmental issue in Australia, behind climate change, not because of the gas but the water and salt that is dragged out of the ground through the extraction process.
It is substantial and no matter what the proponents say, they have, as yet, limited understanding of what to do with it all.
Jensen even had his doubts about their ability to live up to their promises.
The water comes from underground aquifers and there are concerns about what this may mean for all the towns and farms that rely on that water for their personal and business survival.
The salt is another issue entirely.
Jensen used strong language when describing what we could be getting: ``I am concerned regarding the potential for widespread, irreversible, serious environmental harm associated with the widespread application of highly saline and sodic water . . . and hence long-term environmental impacts and economic loss consequences,'' he said.
Jensen also had big concerns about roads tracking over farming land and ecosystems and said the planned rehabilitation was not good enough and would have a severe impact on future generations if mishandled.
Even the department believes the current scheme by Santos's joint venture in this area is not acceptable.
And yet the two projects by BG and Santos-Petronas have been conditionally approved.
The public has the right to ask how and why this has occurred.
The fact that the state Opposition has gone missing entirely on this issue is just as troubling.
This is a debate that Queensland should be having and it isn't.
Minister Garrett has asked for more information on the groundwater issue and he may yet cause some real hardship for the industry by demanding stricter safeguards.
The LNG projects are unlikely to be completely scuttled, as was the case with the Traveston Dam proposal.
As keen as Garrett may be to win some Green kudos, he's not politically naive enough to kill off a massive new industry capable of investing up to $50 billion and creating as many as 18,000 jobs. In addition, this is not like Traveston, which was arguably a poorly thought-out scheme to begin with.
The gas projects have real and lasting benefits for Queensland and could underpin our economy for 25 years or more. They could change our skills base and allow the state to make a seamless transition to a lower-carbon future.
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser says his Government is hoping for a swift decision from Garrett. ``This has already been a two-year-long, rigorous assessment process to ensure the highest environmental standards are met,'' he says, adding that: ``The Bligh Government is determined to see this emerging industry flourish in Queensland, but not to the detriment of the environment.''
But if Garrett imposes extra conditions on the projects it will be another embarrassment for the Bligh Government and raise more questions about its ability to handle the state's economic and industrial growth.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"BHP Billiton and partner Apache Energy are rapidly closing on a final investment decision for their $1 billion Macedon natural gas project in Western Australia, which is set to add another supply source for the state from early 2013.
Engineering firm Clough completed front-end engineering and design work for Macedon earlier this month, while the WA Environmental Protection Authority has recommended conditional approval of the project.
 According to industry sources, the drilling of development wells at the field 40 kilometres north of Exmouth is due to start next month.
BHP Billiton petroleum business president Mike Yeager flagged in March that the project was one of its local growth opportunities, alongside an expansion of the Longford gas plant in Victoria, the new Kipper and Turrum gas projects under construction in the Bass Strait, and liquefied natural gas ventures in the Browse Basin and at the Scarborough and Thebe fields off the WA coast.
The Macedon project will also add to the burgeoning Australian business of Houston-based Apache, which started production at the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oilfields in the Exmouth Basin off the state's north-west coast earlier this year.
Gas from Pyrenees is set to be re-injected into the Macedon reservoir, about 10km away.
Apache owns 28.57 per cent of the WA-42-P permit-holding Macedon, while operator BHP owns the remaining share.
The project to develop Macedon, which was discovered in 1992 and lies just north of the Ningaloo Marine Park, involves four sub-sea wells, an 85km pipeline to shore and a gas treatment plant at Ashburton North.
A 67km gas pipeline to connect the plant to the major Dampier-to-Bunbury line may also carry third-party gas.
The venture will have a production capacity of 200 million cubic feet a day of gas, plus between 250 and 3200 litres a day of condensates, according to BHP, which has suggested it may use the gas in its WA mining operations.
That represents almost a Â­quarter of the state's current gas consumption.
Despite repeated calls by WA gas users for an increase in domestic supplies, it has taken some years to make a decision on Macedon.
BHP has cited its  small size and remoteness . The deposit is too small to be independently developed for an LNG project, and only the rise in recent years in gas demand in the state has now made the project viable for domestic supply, BHP said in an environmental protection statement.
The deposit, below waters up to 180 metres deep, holds about 800 billion cu ft, of which about three-quarters should be recoverable.
A key obstacle to the field's development was removed in November when legislation was passed to broaden the specifications of gas that can be carried in the state's main pipeline.
Under the previous standards, the heating value of Macedon gas was too low for the transmission line.
The onshore gas plant will join Chevron's planned annual 25 million tonne Wheatstone LNG project at Ashburton North, which may also host the potential 6 million-tonnes-a-year Scarborough LNG project between ExxonMobil and BHP, the EPA said.
The deadline for any appeals against the EPA recommendation is midnight tonight.
KEY POINTS The site is just north of the Ningaloo Marine Park. Apache owns 28.57 per cent and BHP the rest. Rise in demand has made it viable.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"A leading international water management expert believes the federal government and the coal seam gas industry can reach an agreement over the budding industry's water issues.
MWH managing director Australia Peter Williams said he expected to see the first two coal seam gas projects eventually approved by federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett, but with conditions attached.
 Mr Garrett last week told Santos and BG Group â€“ which are looking to approve this year coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas projects worth more than $35 billion â€“ that he needed further information about the environmental impacts of the projects before he could approve them.
He also deferred his decision on the projects until October 11, with the minister requesting further information about the long-term impact of the industry on underground aquifers.
The decision surprised BG, which had been hoping to approve its Queensland Curtis LNG project as early as this month, but Santos had already pushed back its final decision schedule to the end of the year.
 There's a balance here for producers and for the regulators,  Mr Williams said.
Mr Williams said it was typical for the government to attach strict conditions when approving major developments, with companies having to meet water quality and treatment standards if the projects were approved.
 Traditionally when the regulator gives approval, the approvals are not just red or green, yes or no,  Mr Williams said.  It's common and acceptable that approval is given with conditions and projects are given green lights to proceed in areas that must be complied with. 
Mr Garrett's concerns centre on the companies' long-term water management strategies which were identified as areas of concern in an assessment by Queensland's co-ordinator general Colin Jensen earlier this year.
Each of the thousands of planned coal seam gas wells will produce huge volumes of mostly brackish water that will need treating and disposal. The companies have focused on treating the water through reverse osmosis, and then finding applications for the cleaned water.
While the co-ordinator general singled out the shortage of detail on the water treatment plans, Mr Williams said companies could be concerned about sharing too much information on what could eventually be a lucrative source of revenue.
 For the owners of the fields, their individual strategies of how they deal with the water become valuable IP for them,  Mr Williams said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"WHEATSTONE SYDNEY, July 20 AAP - The Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) has signed a 20-year agreement to purchase liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Wheatstone gas project in Western Australia.
US oil giant Chevron Corporation, the operator of the project in Ashburton North, announced on Tuesday that its Australian subsidiaries had signed a Heads of Agreement with KOGAS.
 KOGAS, the largest LNG buyer in the world, will purchase 1.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum for 20 years.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"Resources company Santos has secured a $2 billion bank loan to help build a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in central Queensland.
Santos says using it the extra money it will have $6 billion available during construction of its Gladstone project and another in Papua New Guinea.
 The company will have four to seven years to repay the funds.
"
AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"SANTOS has secured a $2 billion loan facility from nine banks as it presses ahead with its liquefied natural gas plans despite last week's environmental delay.
The company's executive vice-president and chief financial officer, Peter Wasow, said the funds would be used to refinance a $700 million facility that matures between 2011 and 2013, and to expand its LNG portfolio, particularly the $8 billion Gladstone LNG project in Queensland. It means Santos will have $6 billion of available funding, including cash, corporate and project debt facilities.
 But it may need further funding, with expectations that the $8 billion price tag will rise.
 Importantly, this facility provides Santos with significant additional liquidity during the scheduled construction period of GLNG and Papua New Guinea LNG, and delivers average maturities beyond first LNG production from the two projects,  Mr Wasow said.
The news will provide some momentum for Santos's GLNG project following last week's announcement that Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett was delaying a decision on clearance for the project after writing to Santos and BG asking for more information on environmental concerns.
Queensland's Co-ordinator-General had previously expressed concerns about the companies' water management strategies and the potential threat to the Great Artesian Basin.
The three-month delay means that Mr Garrett has until October 11 to decide on the projects, which are due to bring about $30 billion of investment into Queensland. Santos says the setback will not delay a financial investment decision on its project, which is expected by the end of the year.
Mr Wasow said 13 banks had offered up to $2.9 billion in funding, which he said reflected the financial community's view on Santos.
 The strong support we received from existing and new lenders demonstrates the strength of the Santos business and financial profile,  he said.
Goldman Sachs JBWere said the announcement was  unlikely in our view to alleviate market concerns that Santos may seek to raise further (discounted) equity funds at the time of an investment decision .
"
GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,3,"SANTOS has secured a $2 billion loan facility to give it greater financial flexibility to fund growth plans that include its $7.7 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project in Queensland.
Santos chief financial officer Peter Wasow said the new facility provided the company with additional liquidity during the construction of the Gladstone and Papua New Guinea LNG projects.
 The Gladstone project is a 60:40 joint venture with Malaysia's Petronas while the PNG LNG project is 13.5 per cent held by Santos.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The excited punters who saw Santos's securing of a $2 billion loan facility as a harbinger to a takeover bid for NSW coal seam gas player Eastern Star Gas may have been a little overeager.
While the $2 billion would more than cover any move by Santos on Eastern Star (market capitalisajtion circa $740 million), and while Santos is the logical bidder for the company, Santos probably has too many immediate spending commitments to make such a move yet.
 Santos already owns 19.7 per cent of Eastern Star and a 35 per cent interest in several Eastern Star leases. It hasn't helped the speculation by declining so far to take a seat on the Eastern Star board.
While Eastern Star appears to have plenty of gas, finding a way to monetise it is the key challenge.
Some believe Eastern Star's reserves could ultimately find a way through Santos's proposed liquefied natural gas facilities in Queensland, but given Santos will be spending billions developing its LNG projects over the coming years â€“ and given there's no other obvious buyer for Eastern Star yet â€“ it may be a while before Santos looks any closer at a serious move.

      Ceramic Fuel Cells' BlueGen gas-to-electricity 
      generators could eventually be available to retail customers, after 
      national retail chain Harvey Norman's commercial arm agreed to stock the 
      product.
      The units, which are about 
      the size of a dishwasher, use fuel cell technology to convert natural gas 
      into electricity. According to Ceramic Fuel 
      Cells, which is listed on the ASX and the London AIM market, over a 
      year the units can produce twice the electricity needed for an average 
      home, with the excess power put into the grid. 
      The BlueGen units also 
      produce enough heat for hot water for an average home. Such units could 
      have a widespread appeal, said Johan Hedstrom, an energy analyst with 
      Southern Cross Â­Equities.
       We're all interested in 
      trying to improve the environment,  he said.  This is an Australian 
      company that's come up with a new product and I think it should be made 
      available to the people who want it and they could get a surprise by the 
      appetite,  he said.
      The BlueGen units would 
      cost $55,000 including installation and servicing through an internet 
      system, a Harvey Norman spokesman said. The cost of installation includes 
      hooking up the unit to the grid and the hot water service. Harvey Norman 
      was planning to market the product to government bodies such as health and 
      education departments, the spokesman said.
      The retailer would also 
      target local councils for facilities  where sustainable technology is 
      mandatory , he said.
      For now the product, which 
      will be sold through Harvey Norman's commercial division, will only be 
      available to commercial clients such as utilities and government 
      bodies.
       Initially BlueGen units 
      will not be sold through the Harvey Norman retail stores, however the 
      long-term plan is to leverage the extended reach of the entire Harvey 
      Norman retail stores to the consumer market,  the company said in a press 
      Â­release.
      Harvey Norman's commercial 
      Â­division will be a non-exclusive distributor of the BlueGen units, 
      initially in NSW and the Australian Capital Territory. That division sells 
      products such as solar power systems to commercial buyers including 
      Â­architects and home builders.
      The product was likely to 
      appeal to that market, particularly for those that wished to market a 
      building on its eco-friendly credentials, Mr Hedstrom said.  As property 
      developers are doing a new development they may well include this as a 
      green appeal aspect. 
      Retailer Neco in Melbourne 
      was named as a distributor of the units last year.
      Ceramic Fuel Cells is working with European 
      energy companies E.ON UK, GDF 
      Suez and EWE on integrated power and heating products. BlueGen 
      units have already been sold to big utilities and other customers in 
      countries including Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland."

      CHEVRON has signed an 
      initial 20-year agreement with Korea Gas 
      Corporation to provide 1.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas 
      a year. Korea Gas will also take a 5 per 
      cent equity stake in Chevron's Wheatstone 
      project in Western Australian. The two deals are estimated to be worth 
      about $19 billion.
      In a heads of agreement 
      that was a subject of speculation last year after a similar offtake 
      agreement with Chevron's other big WA 
      project, Gorgon, Kogas will take 75 per 
      cent of the 1.5 million tonnes a year from Wheatstone and the rest from 
      other participants in the project. 
      Last October, Chevron 
      sold a 16.25 per cent stake in Wheatstone to Apache Corp and 8.75 per cent to Kuwait 
      Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company.
      With the 5 per cent 
      interest in Chevron's Wheatstone field 
      licences, the project and domestic processing facilities, Kogas 
      will take about 1.95 million tonnes a year of LNG.
      Based on today's LNG 
      prices, the deal works out to be worth about $19 billion.
      It continues Chevron's 
      momentum on Wheatstone, after the recent announcement of two gas 
      discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin. The Sappho 1 find will provide gas to 
      both Wheatstone and Gorgon, while the Clio 3 discovery well, about 150 
      kilometres north-west of Onslow in WA's Pilbara, represented another big 
      find for Chevron. It continues to put 
      pressure on Woodside's Pluto project to secure gas from Hess to shore up 
      supplies.
      Chevron Australia managing director Roy 
      Krzywosinski said that having Kogas as a 
      foundation customer would add momentum to the project.
       The Wheatstone hub at 
      Ashburton North has been established to process our significant equity gas 
      as well as third-party natural gas resources located in the Western 
      Carnarvon Basin,  he said.
      Chevron is due to make a final investment 
      decision once front-end engineering and design is done. It is now being 
      completed.
      It comes as another 
      unconventional gas hopeful, Cougar Energy, was granted a trading halt on 
      its shares after the Queensland government's Department of Environment and 
      Resource Management said an environmental protection order would stay in 
      place until a full environmental evaluation had been completed on its 
      Kingaroy project.
      Cougar's pilot plant was 
      closed last week after traces of the cancer-causing compounds benzene and 
      toluene were found in nearby bores.
      Test results released on 
      Sunday found no traces of the dangerous chemicals.
      Cougar said it was

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"
      KOREA Gas, the world's 
      biggest liquefied natural gas buyer, has signed a non-binding deal with 
      Chevron and its Wheatstone project 
      partners to buy $US19 billion ($21.7bn) worth of LNG over
      20 years and take equity in 
      the project. 
      Chevron said it had signed a heads of agreement 
      to supply Kogas with 1.5 million tonnes a 
      year from the planned Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, worth 
      $US936 million a year at current spot prices.
      Kogas, which is rapidly increasing Australian 
      LNG imports to reduce its dependence on the Middle East and spot markets, 
      will take a 5 per cent stake in Wheatstone for an undisclosed sum, 
      bringing total LNG deliveries from Wheatstone to 1.95 million tonnes.
      The deal comes less than a 
      year after Kogas signed a non-binding 
      agreement to buy 1.5 million tonnes of LNG a year from the Chevron-operated 
      Gorgon LNG project, where construction began last year.
      Kogas is in talks with Santos about buying 
      supplies from the Gladstone LNG project in Queensland; with Woodside about 
      the Pluto LNG project; and with Shell about its plans to build its Prelude 
      floating LNG venture.
      South Korean President Lee 
      Myung-bak has indicated he wants to increase Australian LNG imports to 
      between 20 and 30 per cent of the nation's total.
      This would require between 
      7 and 10 million tonnes of Australian LNG a year, up from 4 million now, 
      including the latest Chevron deals.
      ``Kogas could sign up a 
      further 4 million tonnes a year with one or two other LNG projects in the 
      2015-16 timeframe,'' Citi analyst Mark Greenwood said.
      The Wheatstone project, 
      which is 75 per cent-owned by Chevron, is 
      targeting a final investment decision next year and first LNG in 2016.
      The offshore Wheatstone gas 
      will be processed at an LNG plant at Ashburton North where 8.6 million 
      tonnes a year of LNG production is planned.
      Chevron's global gas president, John Gass, said 
      the entry of Kogas added momentum to the 
      Wheatstone development.
      The non-binding nature of 
      the WA deal, with a project not due to produce until 2016, raises 
      questions about the enthusiasm of traditional LNG buyers Korea and Japan 
      for untested Queensland coal seam gas LNG projects planned by Santos and 
      Origin Energy, which are targeting a 2014 start.
      Santos and Origin both 
      wanted to secure buyers for their respective projects by now, but have 
      been hampered by delays to government approval and uncertainty over 
      taxation.
      Morgan Stanley analyst Stuart Baker said the 
      Kogas deal was not an impediment to other 
      LNG proponents.
      ``Clarifying other issues 
      such as fiscal, regulatory or gas supply uncertainties are more important 
      in advancing projects,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      THE Korea 
      Gas Corp has signed a 20-year agreement worth billions of dollars 
      to buy liquefied natural gas from Western Australia but analysts say the 
      deal won't hurt emerging Queensland producers.
      The Australian subsidiaries 
      of US oil giant Chevron Corporation, the 
      operator of the Wheatstone project in WA, have signed a Heads of Agreement 
      with Korea Gas (KOGAS), the world's largest buyer of LNG.
   
      The agreement boosts the 
      likelihood of the Wheatstone project getting final approval, slated for 
      next year. It also absorbs some of the demand potential LNG projects in 
      Queensland hoped to soak up.
      ``I don't think this 
      precludes other LNG projects signing up with KOGAS,'' said Mark Greenwood, a Citigroup 
      analyst. ``We think KOGAS is short of gas 
      in the 2015-2016 time frame. I wouldn't be surprised if they signed up 
      with another one or two Australian LNG projects,'' to acquire a further 4 
      million tonnes a year.
      Under the latest Wheatstone 
      deal, KOGAS will purchase 1.5 million 
      tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years.
      KOGAS also signed an agreement to acquire a 5 
      per cent stake in Chevron's Wheatstone 
      field licences and in the Wheatstone project LNG and domestic gas 
      processing facilities.
      State One Stockbroking 
      energy analyst Peter Kopetz estimated the deal with KOGAS 
      would be worth about $20 billion over its 20-year life, based on previous 
      deals announced.
      He said such a move would 
      boost the chances of the gas project getting final approval.
      ``I think Wheatstone now 
      has contracted about 80 per cent of its LNG,'' Mr Kopetz said.
      In May, KOGAS 
      announced that it had started discussions to buy a stake in Santos' 
      Gladstone LNG (GLNG) project.
      Santos earlier this week 
      bedded down a $2 billion bank facility to help fund its Queensland and 
      Papua New Guinea LNG projects.
      GLNG, estimated to cost 
      about $15 billion, is scheduled to begin production in 2014 - provided it 
      can get federal environmental approval this year and thus make a final 
      investment decision before December 31.

      Chevron's $25 billion Wheatstone liquefied 
      natural gas project has snared another five-star customer in Korea 
      Gas, putting the Western Australian venture firmly on track for a 
      final investment decision next year and adding pressure to rivals seeking 
      to nail down sales contracts.
      The Korean utility, the 
      world's biggest LNG buyer, signed up both as a buyer and partner in 
      Wheatstone, which has now locked in offtake agreements for 80 per cent of 
      its initial capacity. That puts it ahead of Â­rival projects planned in 
      the same timeframe by Santos, Origin 
      Energy, Woodside and Japan's Inpex. 
      Kogas' 20-year agreement to buy 1.95 million 
      tonnes per year of LNG from Wheatstone raises a question mark over its 
      expected multi-billion dollar deal to participate in Santos' Gladstone 
      project. Santos was understood to have been on the cusp of locking in 
      Kogas when the accord was suddenly 
      derailed by the resource super profits tax proposal.
      Santos and partner Petronas 
      have been seeking a second customer for their coal seam gas-based GLNG 
      project for over a year, with Kogas and 
      Sinopec still believed to be among potential high-profile 
      Â­customers.
       The uncertainty over tax 
      regime was unhelpful to put it mildly, but that issue has now largely been 
      resolved and the framework now in place should allow CSG projects to 
      negotiate more comfortably in the market,  said Craig McMahon, Australia 
      analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
      Korea Gas is already one of Chevron's 
      biggest customers for its $43 billion Gorgon project, inking a deal last 
      year worth about $30 billion. Its accord with Wheatstone involves 1.5 
      million tonnes a year of LNG, plus a 5 per cent stake in the offshore gas 
      Â­licences and the onshore plant, which gives it another chunk of the 
      output.
      The purchase agreement, if 
      firmed up, could be worth up to $40 billion based on government estimates 
      of Gorgon contracts inked last year. It adds to a record $90 billion LNG 
      accord that Chevron signed with Tokyo 
      Electric for Wheatstone last year.
      Japan's Kyushu 
      Electric has already signed up as a Wheatstone customer and 
      partner, while gas suppliers Apache and Kuwait's Kufpec also hold stakes 
      in the 8.6 million tonnes a year project.
      For Asian buyers, the 
      simplicity of Wheatstone was a winner, analysts said yesterday, pointing 
      to its low-risk, conventional structure and ample low-CO2 gas 
      resources.
       If you look at the 
      fundamentals, the bones of the project, it's pretty simple and there's a 
      lot to like about it from a customer's perspective,  said Citigroup's 
      head of Australia energy research Mark Greenwood.
      Chevron is completing initial engineering on 
      Wheatstone and plans to seek environmental clearance this half. Its 
      success in locking in customers enhances its chances of starting up in 
      2016 as planned.

      acquired Arrow's Australian coal-seam gas assets for $4.70 cash a 
      share. 
      Dart holds Arrow's former 
      CSG exploration interests in China, Indonesia and Vietnam and aims to 
      replicate Arrow's Australian success story with the international 
      prospects.
      Dart is in need of capital 
      to fund its exploration efforts and has foreshadowed plans to raise in the 
      order of $75 million by way of a placement and an entitlement offer to 
      shareholders.
      The company was given 
      permission by the Australian Securities Exchange to undertake an 
      institutional placement of up to 15 per cent of the capital ahead of 
      listing.
      The bookbuild got under way 
      late yesterday, with Citi, UBS and Wilson 
      HTM the joint lead managers and bookrunners.
      The proceeds will be used 
      to assist in funding of incremental and new business expenditure, which 
      together may total up to $45m in 2010 and $67m in 2011.
      Trading in Dart shares will 
      start today on a deferred settlement basis.
      Arrow shares were yesterday 
      quoted ex-entitlement. Tuesday's cum-entitlement close of $5 a share gave 
      Dart shares a theoretical value of 60c, and a placement at around that 
      price would raise between $30-$35m.
      However, Arrow shares 
      closed yesterday, on an ex-entitlement basis, at $4.66, which implies a 
      theoretical value of 68c a Dart share.
      Moreover, there has been 
      stronger institutional interest in Dart than had been envisaged.
      Emboldened by these trends, 
      the bookbuild went out with an indicative price range of 65c to 85c a 
      share, which if successful would raise up to $40m.
      The bookbuild placement 
      will underpin the price of Dart shares when the company makes its debut 
      today.
      Timis hits paydirt
      WHILE the controversial 
      Romanian-born entrepreneur Frank Timis is not on the ASX's invite list, 
      his Britain-based African Minerals has been kicking some goals lately.
      African Minerals, which is 
      listed on Britain's AIM market, is seeking to develop a $US2.6 billion 
      ($2.93bn) magnetite iron ore project at Tonkolili in Sierra Leone. The 
      massive deposit is said to be the third largest in the world, with 
      resources of 10.5 billion tonnes.
      Last week the company 
      announced that it had signed an MOU (memorandum of understanding) with 
      Shandong Iron and Steel under which the Chinese group may pay up to 
      $US1.5bn to secure a 25 per cent stake in the mine and the right to a 
      long-term supply agreement of 10 million tonnes of iron ore a year at 
      prices discounted by up to 15 per cent below the spot benchmark price.
      It's the second deal with 
      Chinese companies in relation to Tonkolili. In June, China Railways 
      Materials Commercial Corp took a 12.5 per cent stake in African Minerals 
      for pound stg. 168m and also agreed to take a portion of the iron ore 
      production for 20 years. Timis is the executive chairman of African 
      Minerals.
      Timis has been effectively 
      blackballed by the ASX, which has refused to reinstate quotation of the 
      shares of two WA-based companies, International Petroleum (IPO) and 
      African Petroleum (AFQ) because they entered into ``company transforming'' 
      transactions that resulted in Timis obtaining significant, if not 
      controlling, shareholdings and a board seat on both companies.
      The ASX was concerned at 
      the influence Timis may have on the companies' compliance with their 
      continuous disclosure obligations.
      This is despite the 
      companies' undertaking to enter into deeds which would effectively render 
      his shareholding non-voting, and that he would have no executive or 
      management role in the companies.
      Moreover, the ASX got a 
      slap in the face when the ASX Appeals Tribunal found that its decision was 
      ``infected by error and must be set aside'' and that ASX concerns about 
      the potential influence of Timis were ``mere conjecture and speculation'' 
      and that past behaviour was not necessarily a guide to the future.
      The Newcastle-based 
      National Stock Exchange has accepted the undertakings and has granted 
      listing to IPO and AFQ.
      Timis companies have a 
      chequered history in relation to disclosure. Regal Petroleum, another 
      AIM-listed company, was last year hit with a record fine of pound stg. 
      600,000 in relation to overblown statements about a potential oil 
      discovery in Greece, which subsequently turned out to be 
      non-commercial.
      Toronto Stock Exchange 
      considers Timis to be unsuitable to act as a director, officer or major 
      shareholder of a listed company.
      Regal recently came under 
      fire over claims that it took more than a month to disclose that the 
      Ukraine-based explorer had received a state order suspending two of its 
      key licences, and AIM is said to be investigating. But Timis has had no 
      role with Regal for more than two years and has been selling down his 
      stake, which now stands at only 4 per cent.
      Timis has some 
      deep-pocketed supporters, including some foreign institutional investors, 
      who pumped $30m into IPO and $220m into AFQ to drill for oil in largely 
      unexplored areas of Kazakhstan and Liberia.
      The prospectuses for those 
      issues noted the Regal fine and also referred to a private censure and 
      fine in 2008 of an AIM-listed company of which Timis was chairman in 
      relation to ``misleading and unrealistically optimistic'' statements about 
      the company.
      The Financial Times last 
      week revealed that the company was none other than African Minerals and 
      the fine related to statements in 2006 (when the company was known as 
      Sierra Leone Diamond Co) about the discovery of a significant number of 
      rare pink diamonds, which subsequently lost their colour when put though 
      an acid cleaning process.
      African Minerals also came 
      under criticism late last year over claims that it was in advanced talks 
      with Eurasian Natural Resources Co (ENRC) and other Asian groups about 
      investing in the company. The claims pushed up the share price of African 
      Minerals, but ENRC downplayed the claims and the talks have quietly 
      ended.
      The ASX may consider some 
      of those developments when deciding on its response to the Appeals 
      Tribunal ruling -- in particular whether or not to stand by its decision 
      to refuse quotation of IPO and AFQ shares.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      MINERS are facing more 
      doubt about standards in the industry after the State Government revealed 
      13 coal seam gas wells were leaking methane and it had shut down or 
      suspended nine coal mines were shut
      in the past year. 
      Following a poison scare at 
      Kingaroy last week when groundwater was allegedly contaminated by the 
      controversial underground coal gasification process, a different method 
      than CSG, the Government revealed one of the wells had almost half the 
      concentration of leaking gas to make it explosive but was still considered 
      safe.
      The 13 leaky wells are only 
      a fraction of the more than 2000 wells around southern and central 
      Queensland but it is expected more than 20,000 could be drilled to feed 
      the planned multibillion-dollar liquified natural gas plants in 
      Gladstone.
      The State Government has 
      refused to release details on the mines or CSG wells but the Queensland 
      Resources Council said the industry was among the safest in the world and 
      testing for CSG wells showed there were no safety issues.
      Toowoomba deputy mayor Paul 
      Antonio said there were concerns the agricultural industry could be 
      crippled by the impacts of coal seam gas extraction and called on the 
      industry and the Government to improve their science.
      ``I'm saying we really need 
      to get the science right before we go forward,'' Cr Antonio said.
      ``My problem with this is 
      that the more you delve into it, the more you realise there are not enough 
      answers.
      ``I have questions about 
      the science that underpins it all. It's not exact and we need to get a 
      better understanding.
      ``I don't want to play 
      catch-up and find in five years' time we have drained all the water out of 
      the Condamine alluviums.''
      The Government's own 
      Co-ordinator-General has also raised serious environmental concerns and 
      has imposed more than 1200 conditions on two of the CSG-to-LNG projects 
      while federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett has stalled his 
      approval.
      Western Downs Alliance 
      spokesman Michael Bretherick said the known number of leaking gas wells 
      was low.
      ``I believe this is only 
      what we know about. It frightens the hell out of me,'' he said.
      Mines Minister Stephen 
      Robertson yesterday announced eight new mining and environmental officers 
      for the to help police the industry and he was determined to get the right 
      balance.
      Greens Senate candidate 
      Larissa Waters said laws needed to be strengthened to protect groundwater, 
      farmland and the climate from CSG mining.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"
      A NEW gas company lists 
      today on the Australian Securities Exchange with interests in coal seam 
      gas exploration areas in Newcastle and Gunnedah.
      Dart Energy is the exploration arm of Arrow 
      Energy, which is in turn the subject of a $3.4 billion joint takeover by 
      Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina.
     
      Although the listing starts 
      today, Dart's 367 million shares will not start normal trading until 
      August 6.
      The two petroleum 
      exploration areas are numbers 458 near Newcastle and 464 near 
      Gunnedah.
      Partner Apollo Gas has 85 
      per cent of both fields, but Dart will lift its stake in the Newcastle 
      field to 50 per cent after agreeing to fund a $7 million exploration 
      program.
      It can also invest to lift 
      its stake in the Gunnedah field.
      Under the demerger, Arrow 
      Energy shareholders receive a Dart share for every two Arrow shares they 
      held, and will also receive $4.70 cash a share for the sale of their 
      Queensland coal-seam gas assets.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      Australia's newest coal 
      seam gas listing Dart Energy makes its market debut today, but analysts 
      are fearful the new company may struggle to retain support in its early 
      days.
      Dart is a spin-off from 
      Arrow Energy, the pioneering Queensland coal seam gas company being sold 
      to Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina 
      for $3.4 billion. 
      Arrow's early stage, 
      international coal seam gas assets have been siphoned into Dart, along 
      with Arrow's equity stakes in Bow Energy, 
      Apollo Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas 
      Ltd.
      The bulk of the management 
      team that built Arrow has also moved across to Dart, with Nick Davies, 
      Shaun Scott, Graham Yerbury and Stephen Bizzell all taking senior 
      positions within the new entity.
      The company has flagged its 
      intention to raise about $75 million over the coming months to build on 
      its exploration efforts in China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam, and is 
      expected to unveil further details of a share placement around the time of 
      its midday listing.
      Arrow shareholders have 
      received one new Dart share for every two held in Arrow.
      The share price performance 
      of Arrow in recent months has stoked concerns about the early performance 
      of Dart, with the Arrow share price implying a likely debut price of about 
      60Â¢ a share. That's well below analyst valuations of Dart of up to $1 a 
      share.
       [Dart] looks cheap on our 
      numbers, but with the flagged raising and register churn we believe the 
      Dart share price will struggle to achieve 'fair value' for some months,  
      RBS Morgans analyst Nik Burns said.
      Despite the headwinds, 
      MrÂ Burns said Arrow shareholders should  stay on board for the 
      ride .
      There are concerns that the 
      speculative nature of Dart may not suit the risk profile of many of 
      Arrow's shareholders.
      Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee, meanwhile, 
      believes shareholders are unlikely to fully pay up for Dart in the near 
      term.
       A lack of cash generation 
      or reserves makes Dart problematic to value,  Mr Hirjee said.
       In addition, Dart's assets 
      are located in geographic regions with limited visibility for Australian 
      investors, which is likely to warrant a discount in the near term. 
      Dart chief executive Simon 
      Potter is hoping to demonstrate commercial gas flow rates from its assets 
      in 2011, before the first gas sales in 2012. The company aims to be 
      producing 50 petajoules a year of gas by 2015."

      An advisory group on the 
      Great Artesian Basin says it will advise State and Federal Ministers about 
      the need to tighten regulations covering mining and exploration.
      The GAB underlies one-fifth 
      of Australia, and the consultative committee has met in Longreach in 
      Queensland to discuss concerns about extractive industries like coal seam 
      gas. 
      Chairman Jeff Austin says 
      it's set up two working groups to look more at the impact drilling and 
      exploration is having on the aquifers and water sources.
       Coal seam gas is just one 
      of those that is of great concern,  he says.
       The environmental 
      representative (on our group) has come up with all sorts of nasties that 
      the industry is using that we need to be careful of - the operations 
      themselves, the possible interference with GAB acquifers - these are all 
      of great concern to us and we will advise the minister of how to tidy up 
      those guidelines. "
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"
      SANTOS has reported 
      stronger than expected second-quarter revenue, buoyed by rising domestic 
      gas prices and increased sales.
      But this has counted for 
      little as far as investors are concerned, with shares failing to gain 
      traction because little progress has been revealed on sales and merger 
      talks over the $16 billion Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project.
   
      The solid report led 
      analysts to boost earnings guidance for this year, but the Adelaide oil 
      and gas company's shares still drifted 20c to $13.55.
      Santos is trying to secure 
      LNG buyers and project equity partners for GLNG, as well as conducting 
      project merger talks with rival LNG proponents Shell and PetroChina.
      Yesterday's report gave no 
      indication that any deal was imminent. ``GLNG remains in detailed 
      discussions with a number of parties in relation to potential LNG sales, 
      equity in the project and collaboration between projects,'' chief 
      executive David Knox said in an almost exact replica of a statement given 
      by the company two weeks ago after The Australian revealed the company was 
      in talks with Shell.
      .UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said: ``The key 
      driver to Santos has to be progress on Gladstone, but there really wasn't 
      a lot more said about that.''
      Santos's second-quarter 
      revenue jumped 13 per cent to $580 million, beating analyst expectations 
      of about $500m as the company substituted a drop in rain-affected Cooper 
      Basin production with gas in storage.
      Despite attributable 
      production from the Darwin LNG plant being down 50 per cent at 2 
      petajoules because of planned maintenance, Santos still managed to 
      increase its gas price by 1c to $4.38 a gigajoule, indicating domestic 
      prices had improved."
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      DART Energy, the coal seam 
      gas spin-off from Arrow Energy, got off to a good start yesterday despite 
      the sluggish broader market.
      It provided an immediate 
      paper profit to its latest investors - and handy additions to the net 
      worth of Arrow's founders and former directors. 
      Dart's portfolio includes 
      Arrow's overseas coal seam gas assets and investments in Bow Energy, LNG 
      Ltd and Apollo Gas.
      Even before Dart joined the 
      stock exchange list, at noon, it had raised $35 million in an 
      institutional placement overnight Wednesday at 69c a share.
      The shares then went on to 
      debut on the ASX at 75c with plenty of demand for the scrip, which 
      finished the day at 78c.
      That valued Dart at close 
      to $300 million and the shares held by Arrow founder Steve Bizzell, who 
      sold his ordinary shares into the Shell/PetroChina takeover for close to $18 million, 
      at around $1.5 million.
      It valued the 4.3 
      million-odd shares held by another Arrow stalwart, energy industry veteran 
      Jeremy Barlow - who sold his ordinary shares into the takeover for more 
      than $40 million - at about $3.35 million.
      And Dart chairman and 
      former Arrow managing director Nick Davies, who got close to $25 million 
      for his Arrow shares, saw his net worth creep up by over $2 million.
      But there could be a lot 
      more in the wind for Dart's executives, including executive director Shaun 
      Scott, who was Arrow's Australian managing director.
      For he and other Dart 
      directors will share some 13 million options in the company - with Dart's 
      relatively new chief executive, Simon Potter, getting 3.65 million, Mr 
      Davies 1.25 million, Mr Scott and Mr Bizzell some 2.25 million each.
      And options can be pretty 
      lucrative, as on top of their sales of shares into the Shell/PetroChina 
      Arrow takeover scheme, option holders such as Mr Barlow and Mr Bizzell 
      were able to cash in their options at $5.87 each, minus their option 
      exercise price - a price that compared with the $4.70 Shell and PetroChina paid for the ordinary shares.
      Still, as Mr Bizzell and Mr 
      Scott said yesterday, everyone who invested in Arrow early did very, very 
      well. It was floated, raising $5 million, nearly a decade ago and was 
      worth $10 million on its stock exchange debut - while Shell/PetroChina 
      paid $3.5 billion to take it over."
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      Dart Energy has enjoyed a 
      healthy start to life on the Australian Stock Exchange, with the company's 
      shares performing above analyst expectations yesterday.
      Dart was spun out of coal 
      seam gas company Arrow Energy as part of Arrow's $3.4 billion takeover 
      from Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina.
     
      There had been concerns in 
      the lead-up to the debut that Dart â€“ which owns early-stage coal seam gas 
      exploration assets in China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam â€“ was likely to 
      debut around 60Â¢ per share.
      But Arrow shares opened at 
      75Â¢ on their first day of trading, 6Â¢ up on the 69Â¢ at which the company 
      raised $35Â million through an institutional placement ahead of the 
      listing.
      Arrow shareholders had 
      received one share in Dart for every two they held in Arrow.
      While Dart's assets have 
      proved difficult to value, analysts had been tipping Dart to trade at a 
      discount to their valuations due to  unnatural holders  of Dart stock such 
      as hedge funds exiting their positions.
      Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said it was 
      difficult to read too much into the first day's trade.
       We will wait and see how 
      it trades over the first week and see if today's price can be sustained,  
      he said.
      Mr Hirjee has a net asset 
      value on Dart of 90Â¢ per share, but expects the stock to trade at a 
      discount to that due to expectations of future capital raisings and the 
      fact Dart's assets are in regions with limited visibility for 
      investors.
      Arrow's South-East Asian 
      coal seam gas exploration assets have been siphoned into Dart, along with 
      the former's equity stakes in Bow Energy, 
      Apollo Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. 
      Arrow's cornerstone coal seam gas assets in Queensland and currently being 
      sold to Shell and PetroChina.
      Dart has also inherited the 
      bulk of Arrow's management team, with Nick Davies, Shaun Scott, Graham 
      Yerbury and Stephen Bizzell all taking senior positions within the new 
      entity.
      Mr Scott said while there 
      had been a perception Dart could suffer from an early rush for the exits 
      by unnatural holders, he had been confident that Dart could make a solid 
      debut.
       Certainly in all the 
      discussions I'd been involved in, and [Dart chief executive] Simon 
      [Potter] has had the same feedback, everyone was pretty keen on the story 
      and liked the management team so we were pretty confident there'd be some 
      strong demand,  he said.
      The company has flagged its 
      intention to raise up to $75 million - including the $35 million this week 
      - over the coming months to build on its exploration efforts.
      Mr Potter said the 
      placement completed ahead of its listing would increase liquidity in the 
      stock.
       This capital raising will 
      provide Dart with the funds to accelerate activity in current key growth 
      regions and expand new business development activity,  he said.
      Mr Potter is hoping to 
      demonstrate commercial gas flow rates from the company's assets in 2011, 
      ahead of first gas sales in 2012. The company then aims to be producing 50 
      petajoules a year of gas by 2015."
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      Speculation of a deal over 
      its Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project in Queensland has 
      overshadowed a solid quarter of production from oil and gas play 
      Santos.
      While Santos managed to 
      increase revenues during the June quarter Â­despite a drop in 
      production, the focus on the company continues to centre on GLNG.
 
      Santos has been trying for 
      more than a year to secure a long-term customer for GLNG in an effort to 
      support a two-train â€“ or processing line â€“ development instead of a 
      single-train project. The company has also been trying to sell up to a 19 
      per cent stake in GLNG as part of any LNG sales agreement.
      More recently it has been 
      talking to Royal Dutch Shell about a 
      potential combination of the pair's proposed Queensland LNG 
      developments.
      Yesterday Santos chief 
      executive David Knox confirmed the company was working towards a deal. 
       GLNG remains in detailed discussions with a number of parties in relation 
      to potential LNG sales, equity in the project and collaboration between 
      projects,  Mr Knox said.
      In its quarterly result, 
      Santos Â­recorded better than expected revenues for the period of $580 
      million, up 13 per cent from the March quarter and up 20 per cent from a 
      year ago.
      Production of 11.9 million 
      barrels of oil equivalent was down 11 per cent on last year due largely to 
      the impact of flooding earlier this year at Santos's Cooper Basin 
      assets.
      But third-party gas sales, 
      the sale of gas from storage and higher than Â­expected gas prices 
      helped underpin revenues and sales volumes.
      Santos maintained its 2010 
      production guidance of 49 million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent, 
      but Â­increased its production cost guidance from $540 million to $560 
      million to $560 million to $580 million.

      expenditure for 2010 was trimmed by $300 million to $2.3 billion due to 
      Santos's decision to push its final investment decision on GLNG from 
      midyear to the end of this year.
      UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay, who has been calling 
      for Santos to collaborate on GLNG since last year, said yesterday that 
      news on GLNG was going to be critical in the coming months.
       It's good to see them 
      talking about collaboration and I'd like to see them deliver it,  Mr 
      Ramsay said.
      Mr Ramsay said a 
      combination of GLNG with Shell's Queensland project would be the most 
      natural combination of projects.  They [Shell] have got a tremendous level 
      of experience and a skill base that would add value to Santos. I don't 
      think anyone disagrees with that, it's just a matter of how they end up 
      splitting it up in terms of how the project's structured,  he said.
      A combination would allow 
      GLNG to be developed into a four-train, 16 million tonne a year project 
      and Â­increase the likelihood of securing customers.
      On Wednesday Goldman 
      Sachs JBWere analyst Aiden Bradley called for Santos to pursue a 
      merger of projects that would make Shell the Â­operator of the enlarged 
      development.
       We have serious doubts 
      regarding the value to shareholders of Santos Â­operating the project 
      itself and believe the company should instead negotiate a deal with a 
      larger major while it is still in a strong competitive position and can 
      negotiate terms,  Mr Bradley said.
      Santos shares fell 20Â¢ to 
      $13.55.

      GAS: Woodside 
      Petroleum's continued search for gas for its Pluto liquefied 
      natural gas project could push approval of a second stage into next year, 
      after two second-quarter exploration wells came up dry and the company 
      backed off from a 2010 final investment decision target.
      But the news in the Perth 
      company's second-quarter report yesterday was not all bad, with 
      better-than-expected revenue of $1.074 billion, up 4 per cent from the 
      previous quarter, helping lift shares. 
      The company also noted that 
      shifting the huge North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project to the 
      offshore Petroleum Resource Rent Tax as part of a deal with the Gillard 
      government would be either neutral or positive for the company.
      In the quarterly report, 
      Woodside failed to restate a target of 2010 board approval for the 
      second-stage expansion of the Pluto LNG plant on Western Australia's 
      Burrup Peninsula.
      ``A final investment 
      decision for Pluto expansion trains remains contingent on identification 
      of economically viable gas resources, either through exploration volumes 
      and or/other resource owners,'' Woodside said.
      A spokesman said more 
      details on the expansion and whether board approval could be received this 
      year would come in the company's first-half profit report next month.
      Woodside is due to produce 
      first gas from the $13bn Pluto-1 project early next year. Pluto-2, which 
      depends on whether Woodside can shore up gas supply from exploration 
      and/or third parties, is expected to cost about $8bn and would 
      substantially boost the overall profit of the project.
      ``Pluto 2 is contingent on 
      gas, and the quarterly offered no breakthrough on this front,'' Morgan Stanley analyst Stuart Baker said. ``The 
      program includes large prospects, and the area is gas-prone, but delays 
      and a lack of high impact success to date is unwelcome in what is becoming 
      an increasingly competitive LNG environment.''
      The company is in the 
      middle of the nation's biggest continuous deepwater exploration campaign 
      -- a 20-plus well drill program to underpin a second train at Pluto.
      In its report, Woodside 
      said the only two exploration wells completed in the quarter -- Dalia 
      South and Tiberius -- were dry.
      Woodside is also in talks 
      with third-party suppliers, including Hess and BHP Billiton, but no 
      progress was announced.
      Despite the lack of 
      reported progress on Pluto 2, Woodside's shares finished $1, or 2.4 per 
      cent, higher.
      Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the 
      strong revenue result had boosted his full-year earnings forecast for 
      Woodside by 5 per cent to $1.18bn.
      Woodside's production 
      slipped 9 per cent from the previous quarter to 17.5 million barrels of 
      oil equivalent, but it maintained its 2010 production guidance of between 
      70 and 75 million barrels.
      Woodside's Pluto-2 drilling 
      has fallen behind schedule, with only five of nine wells from a November 
      schedule due to have been completed by now fully appraised.
      The schedule for Pluto-2 
      approval hangs partly on success at Woodside's second attempt at the 
      Larsen well prospect, where drilling was suspended because of mechanical 
      problems but which showed gas above the main target zone.
      The hole was re-entered 
      earlier this month, meaning results are expected before Woodside's profit 
      report.
      Woodside also revealed the 
      BHP Billiton-operated Furness-1 oil exploration well off the coast of 
      Exmouth, was dry."

      China is now the world's 
      largest energy user, with implications for Australia's LNG and coal 
      industries. Story Stephen Wyatt and Colleen Ryan 
      China is the coy recipient 
      of another global gold â€“ the top energy user in the world. It beats the 
      United States, which has held the title for more than a century. It is not 
      a title China wants and it disputes the figures.
      But pick either figure â€“ 
      Beijing's or the International Energy Agency's â€“ and the numbers are 
      close, the trend obvious. The power in energy markets now lies with China. 
      This has important geopolitical ramifications, particularly in Africa and 
      the Middle East as China pushes harder, and with scant regard for 
      international sanctions, to ensure reliable supplies.
      The trend also has key 
      implications for Australia's LNG (liquefied natural gas), uranium and coal 
      industries.
      The IEA calculates that 
      last year China used 2.25 billion tonnes of oil equivalent. This measure 
      of energy includes oil, coal, gas, uranium and all other sources. The 
      figure is about 4 per cent more than the energy consumed by the US in 
      2009. Beijing challenges the figures â€“ but even on its calculations, 
      China's energy consumption is only 1 per cent behind the US and on current 
      rates will surpass it by the end of the year.
      One statistic tells the 
      story best: just 10 years ago, China consumed only half the energy of the 
      US.
      Australia's 
      electricity-generating capacity is about 40 gigawatts â€“ China adds almost 
      three times that to its electricity-generating capacity each year. And 
      China's capacity is now 874 gigawatts, up from 65 gigawatts in 1980.
      Another statistic showing 
      China's voracious demand for energy is that coal consumption has risen 
      from 1 billion tonnes a year to more than 3 billion tonnes a year over the 
      past decade. The average Chinese citizen consumes only about one fifth of 
      the energy of the average American â€“ but there are 1.3 billion Chinese to 
      307 million Americans.
      And the Chinese economy is 
      growing rapidly. Even this year, as major export markets in the developed 
      world struggle, it may still grow at a double-digit rate.
      China's ascent marks  a new 
      age in the history of energy , says IEA chief economist Fatih Birol.  As 
      China overtakes the US as the world's largest energy consumer, it is not 
      only a domestic issue for China, but has repercussions for the rest of the 
      world not only in supply terms, but also in how the energy is 
      consumed.
       If China uses electric 
      cars, hybrids and so on, they will impose the manufacturing line on most 
      of the rest of the world. 
      The impact on Australia is 
      immediate and obvious: on trade volumes, global pricing levels and 
      investment. And the outcomes are all positive.
      Consider trade. Already 
      mega LNG deals are signed with China, albeit at ordinary prices, and more 
      may be in the pipeline â€“ from the Gorgon fields, Browse Basin, Sunshine 
      and the North West Shelf.
      Uranium will also benefit 
      eventually.
      But the biggest immediate 
      impact is likely to be on coal, which generates more than 75 per cent of 
      China's electricity needs. And it is increasingly importing Australian 
      coal.
      Historically, China has not 
      been a big coal importer as, with its huge coal reserves, it had been 
      until last year a net coal exporter. No longer.
      And the clout China has on 
      global energy markets flows through to the bottom line of Australian 
      resource producers.
      China has been the marginal 
      supplier of coal to Asia for the past 30 years. When its exports rose, the 
      price of coal in the Asian basin would drop and when its exports fell, 
      coal prices rose.
      But China is no longer the 
      marginal supplier, it's the marginal buyer. Just as swings in China's net 
      exports affect coal prices in the Asian basin, so too do swings in China's 
      coal imports.Â 
      There has been an 
      extraordinary price rise in coal. The thermal coal price is up from $US25 
      a tonne in 2003 to a record of near $US180 a tonne in late 2008, f.o.b. 
      Australia. Thermal coal now trades around $US100 a tonne.Â 
      It's the same for coking 
      coal and other commodities, including crude oil and uranium. Coking coal 
      in 2003 was about $US25 a tonne. Spot coking coal surged through $US450 in 
      late 2008 and now trades around $US200 a tonne.
      Right now China's coal 
      imports are sliding, along with demand for power and China's slowdown in 
      steel production. But it's more a cyclical slowdown than a trend change. 
      Demand from China is expected to remain strong.Â 
      Yet too much faith is often 
      placed in China as the driver of a resources boom.Â China may be the 
      biggest user but it still accounts for only 30 to 45 per cent of total 
      world commodity demand.
      While the rest of the world 
      economy languishes, commodity markets will fight to reclaim fresh highs, 
      especially as the supply of iron ore through coal to uranium is 
      rising.Â 
      Meanwhile, demand from 
      China has an effect on investment flows. Here Australia is competing with 
      the rest of the world and China's interest is now squarely focused, as far 
      as oil is concerned, on Africa.
      In Australia, the big 
      Chinese companies have been principally focused on iron ore to date but 
      their interests are beginning to expand.
      The world's biggest coal 
      producer, Shenhua, is already here. LNG deals come with equity 
      participation for Chinese customers.
      In uranium, China's nuclear 
      power generators have been circling Australian uranium producers. Last 
      year, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holdings bought a controlling stake in 
      Energy Metals for $83.6 million.
      Just how China balances its 
      energy demand over coming decades will be crucial. While the country aims 
      to maintain rapid growth in renewable energies, bringing the total share 
      to 12 per cent by 2015 and 15 per cent by 2020, fossil fuel use will also 
      rise significantly.
      Thermal power will still 
      make up two-thirds of the total by 2020, requiring 3.4 billion tonnes of 
      coal.
      China's energy consumption 
      is also a key variable in greenhouse gas emissions globally. Here the 
      story is less optimistic.
      Despite a commitment to 
      reduce carbon dioxide intensity by 40 to 45 per cent, China is still not 
      prepared to promise any absolute reductions in gross greenhouse gas 
      emissions by 2020.
      CHINA HUNGRIER FOR OUR LNG, 
      URANIUM, COAL
      China's rapidly rising 
      energy demand, which has helped drive expansion in Australian natural gas, 
      coal and uranium for years, has accelerated.
      At the front is the 
      liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector with an unprecedented string of 
      multibillion-dollar contracts to China's two biggest players, CNOOC and 
      PetroChina. A deal with Sinopec seems a 
      matter of time.
      Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Oil Search have 
      all been party to big-ticket LNG sales contracts, while a host of local 
      services companies will benefit from the LNG projects in Australia owned 
      by multinationals that are partly underwritten by Chinese purchase 
      commitments.
      China is Australia's 
      second-biggest LNG export market, after Japan, and deliveries are set to 
      surge as new contracts take effect.
      The North-West Shelf 
      venture's groundbreaking 25-year deal in 2002 to supply China's first LNG 
      has been dwarfed by recent accords. A 20-year deal last August by PetroChina for LNG from ExxonMobil's 
      share of the huge Gorgon project in Western Australia was valued at $50 
      billion. PetroChina will buy almost as 
      much from Shell's share of Gorgon, making it the biggest customer for the 
      $43 billion project.
      CNOOC's LNG contract for up 
      to $80 billion with UK gas giant BG's coal-seam gas-based venture in 
      Queensland will also start in 2014.
      As for Australian-listed 
      firms, Santos and Papua New Guinea's Oil Search are party to Exxon's 
      contract to sell LNG from their $US15 billion PNG project to Sinopec.
      China's interest in 
      Australia's unconventional gas resources is obvious in the tie-up between 
      Shell and PetroChina in a $3.45 billion 
      takeover bid for Arrow Energy.
      At the smaller end of town, 
      London-listed junior Altona Energy has 
      attracted the interest of CNOOC for a potential $3 billion coal-to-liquids 
      project in South Australia.
      China's plans to expand 
      nuclear power capacity sixfold this decade have excited the junior end of 
      the exploration industry.
      Unsurprisingly, they are 
      targets: China Guangdong Nuclear Power is grabbing Energy Metals while 
      PepinNini and Southern Uranium also have 
      Chinese investors. More are certain, says Peter Strachan at Stock 
      Analysis, who expects higher exports to follow.
      China last year accounted 
      for 10 per cent of Australia's coal exports but some big-ticket deals have 
      underlined the scope for growth. Yanzhou Coal spent $3.5 billion to buy 
      Felix Resources in December while Chinese 
      interests back Clive Palmer's $8 billion China First coal project in 
      Queensland.
      On the oil side, direct 
      Chinese investment in Australia has so far been limited to Sinopec's 
      purchase in 2008 of a majority stake in AED 
      Oil's Puffin project for $600 million, although CNOOC has been 
      actively exploring off the north-west coast."

      Woodside Petroleum's efforts to shore up 
      critical gas reserves for its Pluto liquefied natural gas plant expansion 
      have stalled, creating further uncertainty over its ability to approve a 
      doubling of the project's size by the end of the year.
      The company said on Friday 
      it hadn't found any more gas for a second train or processing line at 
      Pluto, with the three wells drilled in the June quarter â€“ Dalia South-1, 
      Tiberius-1 and the previously announced Hine-1 â€“ all dry. 
      Woodside dropped its 
      previous guidance of a final investment decision (FID) on Pluto train 2 by 
      the end of the year, saying only that such a decision was contingent on 
      securing viable gas reserves.
      It is doubling its 
      exploration efforts in WA, after a second drill rig, the Ocean America, 
      joined the campaign last month.
      The drilling is part of a 
      20-well campaign in the Carnarvon Basin by Woodside â€“ the largest carried 
      out in Australian waters â€“ aimed at identifying the gas reserves to 
      underpin Pluto's second train.
      Construction of the first 
      train is 91 per cent complete and on track for first LNG production in 
      early 2011. But Woodside had hoped to approve the project's expansion 
      shortly in order to move its construction workforce straight on to the 
      second train.
      The exploration campaign 
      update was part of Woodside's June quarterly report, which blamed a 10 per 
      cent year-on-year fall in production largely on planned maintenance 
      shutdowns on trains 3 and 5 at the North-West Shelf LNG project. 
      Production for the quarter was 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, 
      down from 19.4 million barrels a year ago.
      Revenue for the period was 
      a different story; the $1.1 billion recorded was up 48 per cent from 
      2009.
      UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said Woodside's 
      revenues topped forecasts thanks to much stronger than expected LNG 
      prices. But Woodside would struggle to approve Pluto train 2 this 
      year.
       You would have to say a 
      FID by the end of the year is going to be a tough goal for them to reach, 
      when you think not only do they have to have reserves but also the buyers 
      lined up as well,  Mr Ramsay said.
      Woodside's current 
      exploration campaign started promisingly, when it encountered gas at its 
      Larsen, Noblige and Martell wells.
      The latest dry run in 
      exploration puts more pressure on Woodside in its negotiations with US 
      company Hess and other third-party gas owners in the Carnarvon Basin.
      Woodside confirmed on 
      Friday that it continued discussions with other resources owners in 
      relation to the Pluto expansion.
      Hess is Woodside's 50 per 
      cent partner in the WA-404-P permit and also has several discoveries in 
      its wholly owned WA-390-P permit.
      KEY POINTS
      Woodside hasn't found any 
      more gas reserves to underpin its Pluto plant expansion. The dry run puts 
      pressure on Woodside's negotiations with USâ€Špartner company Hess.

      The continued lack of a 
      carbon price is limiting investment options, writes Kate Burgess.
 
      The outlook for renewable 
      energy companies was boosted by reforms that improve revenue prospects but 
      the continued lack of a carbon price limits investment options for the 
      average punter. Investment dollars will not roll into renewable energy 
      technologies until a carbon price is introduced and more is known about 
      energy policy.
      Julia Gillard, as part of 
      Labor's election platform, has promised money for power lines to connect 
      renewable energy generators to the national grid. This will give a big 
      fillip to companies that own generating sites that are not yet connected, 
      such as geothermal generators in South Australia.
      The Coalition is yet to 
      articulate a clear climate change policy.
      Labor's plan to connect 
      renewable energy sources to the power grid is still some years off and 
      technical and practical issues are yet to be overcome.
      Share prices of renewable 
      energy companies rose in June with the government's decision to split 
      renewable energy targets (RET) into small and large scale, meaning there 
      was more support for large projects.
      In effect, large-scale 
      developments do not have to compete with household energy production from 
      solar panels or solar hot water.
      The new rules favour large 
      renewable energy providers with developed technologies, says Australian 
      Clean Tech Index managing director John O'Brien.  RET will drive almost 
      entirely wind in the short term, and there is only really one listed wind 
      farm company, Infigen Energy. 
      Solar and geothermal power, 
      which require millions of dollars to be invested before large-scale 
      projects can be built, may miss out on the RET, which aims to have 45,000 
      gigawatt hours of renewable energy generated in Australia by 2020.
      Established renewable 
      energy providers face a more stable future than small companies with 
      embryonic technologies.
       The outcome of the revised 
      renewable energy credit legislation provides the required certainty for 
      large-scale renewable energy but has left small-scale renewable energy 
      with more uncertainty than the industry would like,  Wilson HTM analyst 
      Jenny Cosgrove says.
      Less established operators 
      are especially vulnerable because many are reliant on government grants. 
      The geothermal and wave energy sectors are hanging out for another round 
      of funding after the government's $35 million renewable energy development 
      program was distributed last year.
      The real problem, O'Brien 
      argues, is the lack of different options to suit various investors, from 
      super funds through to venture capital and hedge funds.
       There are a variety of 
      risk-return profiles possible, from wind farms with stable, low-risk, 
      low-return cash flows to developers of solar technologies,  he said.  But 
      there is not enough in the low-risk sector in which to invest. 
      The performance of 
      ASX-listed clean technology companies has been tragic in the past 
      year.
      The Australian Clean Tech 
      Index fell 32 per cent in the 2010 fiscal year, way behind the broader 
      sharemarket indices. The S&P/ASX 200 gained 11.8 per cent and the 
      S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries Index added10.5 per cent.
      The Prime Minister 
      indicated the government would revisit the scrapped carbon pollution 
      reduction scheme, but not before the scheme has been put to a citizen's 
      assembly. This is likely to take at least 12 months but will be combined 
      with policy that rewards businesses for early action on climate change, a 
      crucial omission of the original CPRS.
      Early action from 
      businesses will centre on energy-efficiency measures likely to create a 
      range of future investment options, as companies are established to 
      develop new technologies.
       For now, investing in 
      renewable energy is a niche retail investor proposition,  O'Brien says. 
       Having a price on carbon is going to have an important effect. 
      Energy-efficiency projects are waiting on the shelf . 
      As technologies such as 
      photovoltaic solar panels mature, the risk of investing in early-stage 
      projects will decrease.
      There are encouraging signs 
      from state governments on renewable-energy policy, which should translate 
      to more retail investment opportunities.
      The renewable energy 
      industry is also campaigning for a feed-in tariff to apply to renewable 
      energy generators, meaning they would be paid for feeding power into the 
      grid. Their only source of revenue is the trade in renewable energy 
      certificates (REC) issued for each kilowatt of power they generate. 
       Dirty  power generators, such as coal and gas plants and big industrial 
      electricity users, must offset their carbon emissions by buying RECs.
      Big electricity producers 
      are also being constrained by the lack of a climate change policy. The 
      Energy Supply Association of Australia found that the estimated capital 
      expenditure planned for power utilities in the next five years has dropped 
      to $8.2 billion in 2010 from $18 billion in 2009.
      Utilities such as Origin Energy and AGL have been buoyed by the 
      RET legislation because it means greater revenue for their wind farms. But 
      the prospects of reducing carbon emissions is limited if their capital 
      expenditure plans are constrained."

      THE State Government has 
      admitted the science behind the potential $50 billion coal seam gas 
      industry isn't good enough, throwing down the gauntlet to the industry to 
      fix it or go.
      As farmers and 
      environmentalists protested against the Government's gas plans for Roma 
      and the Surat Basin yesterday, Natural Resources Minister Stephen 
      Robertson said the companies had to ``answer some fundamental questions'' 
      to assure the community that their procedures had good scientific 
      backing. 
      ``The science is not 
      complete and that is why the Co-ordinator-General was so thorough and put 
      those 1200 conditions on the projects,'' Mr Robertson said.
      A prime concern is the 
      impact the industry will have on groundwater, particularly the Great 
      Artesian Basin, which supplies water to farmers and residents of inland 
      Queensland.
      The coal seam gas process 
      includes pumping gas from underground coal seams but that also means water 
      and salt come to the surface.
      Mr Robertson said that if 
      the companies did not meet the conditions then licences to operate would 
      be withheld.
      ``Unless these companies 
      demonstrate environmental sustainability and they can operate in an 
      environmentally safe way then they won't get a licence to operate and they 
      will not gain the acceptance of the community in which they wish to 
      work,'' he said. ``As the landholders have pointed out - if you get it 
      wrong it could have long-term consequences.''
      Premier Anna Bligh faced an 
      angry 100-strong crowd at Roma yesterday, with the Basin Sustainability 
      Alliance calling for an independent review into all coal seam gas 
      projects.
      Ms Bligh said the 
      Government was committed to ensuring new coal gas industries met with a 
      ``great deal of rigour''.
      ``This is a great 
      opportunity for new wealth and prosperity, but we need to get it right,'' 
      she said.
      Gas and petroleum industry 
      spokesman Matthew Paul said there was ``enough science there that we don't 
      expect a lot of impact on the aquifers''.
      ``(But) you can't make a 
      100 per cent guarantee that something won't happen,'' he said.
      Meanwhile, tests from bores 
      near Cougar Energy's UCG plant in Kingaroy have come back within drinking

      plant at Morwell that would use a combination of natural gas and gas 
      derived from coal.

       There's been some

      REEFS and islands along 
      northern Australia's Kimberley coast are highly vulnerable to spills from 
      a new offshore gas drilling and processing plant whose operator will not 
      make contingency plans for a large spill.
      In its environmental impact 
      statement, Inpex, a Japanese company planning to extract 8.4 million 
      tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year, has said it will deal with a major 
      leak of hydrocarbons if it occurs. 
      The statement contains maps 
      of the predicted impacts of any smaller leaks from the Ichthys offshore 
      gas project.
      They show that in the wet 
      season, hydrocarbons from the well head could be expected to reach 
      bird-breeding areas along the coast, and possibly reefs and islands.
      A larger leak, similar to 
      that from the Montara oil and gas well in the Timor Sea last year, would 
      probably douse areas of the coast.
       Spill modelling has not 
      been included for the longer-term sub-sea well failure scenarios because 
      of their very low likelihood,  the statement says.
       In the event of a failure, 
      modelling would be 'undertaken at that time for current weather conditions 
      and spill flow rates, to guide response efforts'. 
       Large hydrocarbon spills 
      from the offshore development area . . . are predicted to reach some point 
      on the shorelines of Browse Island, Scott Reef and the Western Australian 
      Kimberley coast. 
      The environment group 
      WWF-Australia said Inpex had avoided outlining its plans for an oil or gas 
      leak to downplay such a prospect.
       Their report acknowledges 
      that they are putting this region under a very serious threat but then say 
      they do not need a plan to cope with their worst-case scenario,  said 
      WWF-Australia conservation manager Gilly Llewellyn."
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"
      THE Great Artesian Basin 
      co-ordinating committee has called for tighter regulation of mining and 
      exploration in the area.
      There has been a dramatic 
      increase in exploration and drilling, particularly for coal seam gas, in 
      the basin in recent years. 
      The basin lies under one 
      fifth of Australia, and -- along with coal seams -- holds 65,000 million 
      megalitres of water.
      The fear is that drilling 
      will break water-bearing seams, causing contamination and water loss.
      ``We are talking new 
      technology for coal seam gas, and there is big community angst out there 
      about how they propose to do it,'' committee chair Jeff Austin said 
      yesterday.
      ``We are being told it is 
      all under control, but we don't have enough evidence to satisfy ourselves 
      that it won't jeopardise the GAB in certain areas forever.''
      The Council of Australian 
      Governments will shortly sign off on new guidelines that will cover the 
      extractive industries.
      But Mr Austin said basin 
      residents are worried the water in the basin -- a huge national asset -- 
      could be jeopardised by exploration for those other assets, gas and 
      petroleum. ``We can't treat them separately, one can't proceed without 
      proper consideration of the other,'' he said.
      The irony is the basin 
      community is engaged in a 15-year, $477 million program, funded by federal 
      and state governments and landholders, to pipe and cap open bores. Around 
      1500 megalitres flow out through bores every day, but up to 90 per cent is 
      wasted to evaporation and seepage.
      Capping and piping the 
      bores will result in big water savings, but Mr Austin said any damage to 
      the aquifers ``will make a nonsense of the amount of money that has been 
      poured into the capping and piping program''.
      Bernie Caffery is a crop 
      management consultant based in Dalby, in southern Queensland and a member 
      of the GAB protection group.
      He said just west of Dalby, 
      Arrow Energy is already extracting coal seam gas. ``Then west from there 
      you go into Queensland Gas and Origin, and Santos are further out to 
      Roma.''
      Mr Caffery said the 
      overwhelming fear is what the extraction will do to the aquifers. ``Inland 
      Australia, it can't do without that underground water,'' he said.
      Mr Caffery's group is 
      calling for a moratorium. ``It has all happened so quickly and it is such 
      a big footprint, the time hasn't been allowed to do a study in each area 
      to understand the impact of taking all that water out,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      CHINA is aggressively 
      developing its own massive gas reserves, closing a window for Queensland's 
      liquefied natural gas hopefuls.
      Production of 
      unconventional gas, lodged in rocks and coalfields, may exceed 11 billion 
      cubic feet a day in China by 2030, accounting for more than a quarter of 
      total gas supply, according to a new report by consultants Wood 
      Mackenzie. 
      ``There is a clear 
      imperative for LNG sellers to conclude deals with Chinese buyers in the 
      next two or three years, or risk seeing China disappear as a potential 
      foundation buyer for their projects,'' Wood Mackenzie say.
      This is not good news for 
      the likes of Santos, BG Group and Origin 
      Energy, which are all racing to develop LNG projects at Gladstone, fed by 
      Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas reserves.
      Wood Mackenzie said Chinese 
      LNG demand in 2020 may reach 46 million tonnes a year, up from a previous 
      estimate of 31 million tonnes.
      But overall gas demand may 
      rise to 43 billion cubic feet a day in 2030 from 9 billion cubic feet a 
      day last year.
      ``This strong demand growth 
      will not purely be driven by gross domestic product,'' said Gavin 
      Thompson, China gas study director for Wood Mackenzie.
      ``The gas demand story is 
      about displacing oil products, not coal, in the industrial and residential 
      sectors.''
      He said shale gas was a 
      major ''growth story'' in China.
      ``However, unconventional 
      gas resources will take a significant time to develop and, therefore, 
      meeting its gas demand will require China to import significant additional 
      volumes of LNG and piped gas, particularly up to 2020.''"

      BHP is favoured to supply 
      gas for Woodside's Pluto-2 project, writes Angela Macdonald-Smith.
      BHP Billiton is emerging as a front runner to 
      supply gas for the expansion of Woodside 
      Petroleum's $14 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project in 
      Western Australia, with a deal possible this year. 
      While the focus for 
      third-party gas supplies for Pluto-2 has centred on US explorer Hess, 
      Deutsche Bank believes a favourable deal 
      could be struck by Woodside for gas from the Scarborough field held 
      jointly by BHP and ExxonMobil. An 
      agreement could be reached this half, although the first half of 2011 is 
      more likely, Deutsche analyst Paul Young said. Such a tie-up would solve 
      Woodside's gas supply woes for the Pluto expansion and help close the gap 
      on rival Chevron, which is racing ahead 
      with its own Wheatstone LNG project.
      Chevron yesterday released its draft 
      environmental impact statement (EIS) for Wheatstone, the latest in a 
      string of milestones that has propelled the $25 billion venture rapidly up 
      Australia's queue of proposed LNG projects. It declared a mid-2011 target 
      for a final investment decision for the first two trains, indicating a 
      fast-tracked schedule compared to its original second half 2011 date.
      BHP petroleum chief Michael 
      Yeager in May flagged a Pluto tie-up as one of the options being 
      considered for the Scarborough and Thebe fields, which hold about 13 
      trillion cubic feet of gas and lie far off the coast, about 280 kilometres 
      north of Onslow. Another option is a gas supply deal for Wheatstone but 
      Chevron already has enough gas for the 
      first phase of that project so any additional feed gas from a third party 
      would probably be only for a later expansion.
      Deutsche Bank analysts regard a joint 
      development of Pluto-2 and Pluto-3 as the best option for Scarborough and 
      Thebe, creating value for both BHP and Woodside. A deal with Woodside on 
      gas supply could be worth about $US9.3 billion ($10.4 billion) to BHP, or 
      $2.29 a share, rising to $US17.3 billion once production starts up, 
      Deutsche's Young estimates.
      A stand-alone LNG 
      development for Scarborough and Thebe at the same onshore site at 
      Ashburton North to be used for Wheatstone would be more expensive, at up 
      to $US20 billion and offer less value for the resource owners. Exxon has 
      already ruled out a floating LNG project at Scarborough.
      Woodside last week 
      underlined the lack of recent success in its intensive exploration 
      campaign to shore up gas reserves for the Pluto expansion, dropping its 
      earlier guidance of a final investment decision on a second train by the 
      year end.
      While Woodside reported 
      some early success in the program, with finds at its Larsen, Noblige and 
      Martell wells, it is still short of the reserves it needs to go ahead with 
      Pluto-2, which otherwise is the closest new LNG project to being approved 
      in the Carnarvon Basin.
      New York-based Hess has 
      been clear it is in no hurry to commit gas from the 10 discoveries it has 
      made so far in its WA-390-P permit in the Carnarvon Basin until it 
      completes drilling in its wholly owned licence.
      That points to Scarborough 
      gas as the most compelling for Woodside in the near term, reasons 
      Deutsche, which calculates it also offers better economics for Woodside 
      than a deal with Hess as it would provide enough reserves for a two-train 
      expansion.
      The end result could be a 
      joint venture for Pluto-2 and Pluto-3, half-owned by Woodside, 25 per cent 
      by BHP, 15 per cent by ExxonMobil and 5 
      per cent each by the existing Pluto customers Kansai Electric and Tokyo Gas.
      Meanwhile, Chevron 
      revealed in the draft EIS for Wheatstone that the first LNG train could 
      start up in early 2016, with the second late the same year.
      That makes for a shorter 
      construction time than for its huge $43 billion Gorgon project. Some five 
      to six trains with a combined capacity of 25 million tonnes a year could 
      be operational by 2022."

      Hundreds turned out at a 
      public meeting in Kingaroy last night against mining exploration for coal 
      seam gas projects in Queensland's South Burnett region.
      Cougar Energy's UCG project 
      in the South Burnett town remains on hold after traces of two dangerous 
      chemicals were found in bore water on its underground coal gasification 
      (UCG) site. 
      The Kingaroy Concerned 
      Citizens Group (KCCG) says a Western Australian company, Red 
      River Resources, has a permit to explore for coal seam gas in and 
      around the town in the next few years.
      But the Queensland 
      Government says there is a moratorium on any further development of coal 
      gasification projects in the state.
      Queensland Mines and Energy 
      Minister Stephen Robertson is trying to allay the fears of South Burnett 
      residents worried about more proposed mining activity in the region.
      He says the exploration 
      will not affect homes and no more such projects will be considered until 
      2012.
       There are standards in 
      place that do not allow for explorers to drill near by homes, so the 
      suggestion that they'll be drilling in Kingaroy streets is simply not the 
      case,  he said.
      Kingaroy builder Mark 
      Westbrook says all UCG mining permits should be cancelled.
       Unanimously we voted as a 
      community we are totally against coal gasification underground and we want 
      to see it stopped,  he said.
       We want to see policy 
      changes - we don't want to see any more of this filthy technology in this 
      coal basin because it is just affecting people's livelihoods, values and 
      industry. 
      KCCG spokesman John Dalton 
      says about 300 residents supported several motions at the public meeting 
      last night.
       One of them was for 
      Kingaroy Shire Council and the State Government to ban UCG,  he said.
       The other one was to 
      reform a committee, the third one was to form a fighting fund, and the 
      fourth one was that we invite DERM [Queensland Department of Environment 
      and Resource Management] to come back to Kingaroy to ensure this never 
      happens again. 
      The Queensland Resources 
      Council (QRC) concedes it will be hard to convince people in Kingaroy that 
      UCG is safe despite the latest tests showing minimal contamination of 
      bores at the Cougar Energy site.
      QRC chief executive Michael 
      Roche says community confidence in the venture has been shattered.
       We will have to work with 
      the authorities to make sure that people believe that all the testing is 
      independent, it's verifiable and if there's a restart to the process, an 
      all-clear to the use of that water,  he said.

      has been done independently, at arm's length from the companies.

      government approvals before making final investment decisions on $15 
      billion LNG projects in Queensland.
      The position will be a 
      vital one for both industry and politicians. For industry, the position 
      will monitor the balance between domestic and overseas supply of coal seam 
      methane gas, with the government keen to avoid a repeat of the West 
      Australian situation where domestic gas prices rose as the export-oriented 
      industry cranked up.
      But the government is also 
      coping with the political fallout, with loud protests from a coalition of 
      farmers and environmentalists against the development of a coal industry 
      on the Darling Downs."
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      Oil Search has launched a 
      strategic review and started talks with its joint venture partners in a 
      bid to lock in an expansion of its $15 billion liquefied natural gas 
      project in Papua New Guinea.
      The Australian-listed oil 
      and gas producer has committed to building two processing units, or 
      trains, which are under construction and will handle 6.6 million tonnes of 
      LNG a year as part of a joint venture with US oil major ExxonMobil 
      and Adelaide-based Santos. 
      Oil Search has already 
      flagged itsÂ interest in doubling the size of theÂ PNG LNG 
      facility and yesterdayÂ the company said that after  aÂ range of 
      discussions  with its jointÂ venture partners it was confident of 
      securing additional gas sales.
       Resources for expansion 
      may come from either existing project fields, discoveries where there is a 
      high commonality of ownership interest with PNG LNG or exploration 
      opportunities and work is ongoing on all these options,  the company 
      said.
      Oil Search said the first 
      stage of an offshore seismic survey along with new seismic studies in the 
      PNG Highlands was carried out during the quarter with data being 
      processed.
      Macquarie energy analyst 
      Adrian Wood said a third train would be  hugely profitable  for Oil Search 
      and worth up to $2.50 a share.
      Mr Wood said he expects Oil 
      Search will pile pressure on Exxon to make drilling progress on further 
      appraisal wells in early 2011.
      Oil Search recorded a 2 per 
      cent rise in second-quarter production to 1.94 million barrels of oil 
      equivalent compared with 1.906 million BOE in the corresponding period a 
      yearâ€ƒearlier.
      Its production guidance for 
      the 2010 full year remains unchanged at between 7.2 million and 7.4 
      million BOE.
      Revenue for the quarter was 
      $US142.7 million ($159 million), a 7Â per cent rise from the first 
      quarter.
      The gas project, which 
      could double PNG's gross domestic product, will consist of gas-extraction 
      facilities in the country's Western Highlands, 450 kilometres of pipeline, 
      and liquefaction facilities near Port Moresby.
      ExxonMobil has a 33.2 per cent interest in PNG 
      LNG, Oil Search holds a 29 per cent stake, and Adelaide-based Santos owns 
      13.5 per cent.
      Other shareholders include 
      the PNG government and Japan's Nippon Oil Exploration.
      In March, the partners 
      confirmed a $US14 billion financing deal,â€ƒclearing the way for 
      construction to accelerate.
      Oil Search shares closed 9Â¢ 
      higher at $5.93.
      KEY POINTS Oil Search is 
      considering all its options to increase gas sales. The company plans to 
      double the size of its PNG LNG facility. Oil Search is processing data 
      from an offshore seismic study in PNG."

      A company looking to build 
      a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Newcastle says it is 
      confident it can co-exist with other port stakeholders.
      Newcastle is the world's 
      biggest coal port, with several shipping movements per day. 
      Eastern Star Gas says it is 
      only predicting 10 LNG shipments per year and is currently looking at 
      strategies to reduce noise, such as using electric motor drives.
      A feasibility study is 
      being finalised and the company's chief commercial officer, Roland 
      Sleeman, is confident the plant would not impact other port movements.
       When you look at the 
      movements in the port and the fact it only takes an hour or so for a 
      vessel to get in and or out of the port, we think that there's plenty of 
      room for LNG carriers to be handled,  he said.
       Whilst having an export or 
      loading facility offshore is technically a possibility, it's not the 
      present focus of our feasibility study. "

      big step will be taken in utilising Federal legislation for the protection 
      of our Great Artesian Basin aquifers and to help prevent problems like the 
      recent concerns over Cougar Energy,â€? Mr Scott said.
      Mr Scott also said he would

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"
      ENERGY major Chevron, 
      continuing its breakneck progress towards development of the $US20 billion 
      ($22.9bn) Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia, 
      has sealed a crucial land-use agreement with native title holders.
      The US company's plans 
      steal a march on its rivals by taking a final investment decision on 
      Wheatstone by next year have firmed up; it recently signed Korea 
      Gas as a major long-term buyer and as a project partner. 
      Chevon also announced its 
      fifth recent gas discovery off the WA coast, boosting potential supplies 
      for the planned Wheatstone development at Onslow, 1400km north of 
      Perth.
      Chevron said yesterday it had signed a heads of 
      agreement with the Thalanyji people of Onslow for a major benefits package 
      including education, training, employment, business development and 
      financial support.
      Neither Chevron 
      nor the Thalanyji people would reveal the value of the agreement, which 
      took 18 months to negotiate.
      The agreement allows for up 
      to five LNG trains to be constructed on the 500ha Wheatstone site.
      Meanwhile, Chevron's 
      main local rival, Woodside Petroleum, is 
      bogged down in a bitter dispute between rival native title claimants in 
      the Kimberley that is threatening to delay the approval of its Browse LNG 
      project.
      Chevron has a minority interest in Browse but 
      Woodside, as operator, has been negotiating with indigenous groups.
      Rodney Hicks, deputy chair 
      of the Thalanyji people, said the agreement with Chevron recognised his people as stakeholders 
      in a project that would deliver huge economic benefits to the region and 
      to the nation.
      ``This demonstrates that 
      native title has proved to be a positive factor in building Australia's 
      economy, and in recognising that Aboriginal people are continuing to 
      contribute strongly to the prosperity and development of the nation,'' he 
      said.
      ``It demonstrates the fact 
      that Aboriginal people are willing to embrace development, so long as they 
      are given appropriate recognition and a stake in the developments on their 
      lands.''

      year.
      As well as the $1 billion 
      terminal, Eastern Star Gas is proposing a $500 million pipeline from 
      Narrabri to Newcastle, on a different route from the Hunter to Queensland 
      pipeline promoted by a consortium of Hunter business people.

      Under this plan, the gas 
      would go from Narribri to Coolah and Wellington, then on to Bayswater and 
      Newcastle.
      Coal-seam gas industry is 
      widely seen as a speculative industry, but Mr Sleeman said Eastern Star

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      The directors of Arrow 
      Energy will do very well out of the $3.5 billion takeover by Shell and 
      PetroChina, as Tony Grant-Taylor 
      reports
      COAL seam gas over the past 
      few years has created quite a few fortunes in Queensland. 
      And the industry's latest 
      deal may have created a new high-water mark on what to ask for when 
      selling your coal seam gas operation to multinational energy 
      companies.
      Shell and PetroChina 
      obviously have deep pockets and are willing to stump up the cash to get a 
      deal across the line.
      And the directors of Arrow 
      Energy will reap millions of dollars from the sale of their stakes in the 
      coal seam gas player.
      But they also get lucrative 
      fees and termination payments as the takeover of Arrow, and the demerger 
      of its non-core assets through newly listed Dart 
      Energy, get bedded down.
      Nick Davies, Arrow's former 
      managing director, gets a $1.15 million termination payment from Arrow, 
      while the group's former Australian chief executive Shaun Scott gets 
      $699,000 and fellow director Stephen Bizzell about $618,000.
      But before they get 
      terminated, they also receive fees for serving out their time at Arrow to 
      see the takeover and demerger through.
      Mr Davies pockets $512,500 
      on this score, Mr Scott $312,000 and Mr Bizzell $487,500 plus GST.
      The three also get some 
      petty cash during this period; $100,000 a month for Mr Davies, $62,000 a 
      month for Mr Scott and $60,000 for Mr Bizzell.
      Which was nice going, 
      topped off in Mr Davies' and Mr Scott's cases by a payment to each of just 
      over $1 million as ``incentive payments'' due from Arrow pursuant to 
      pre-existing contractual entitlements. Oh, and let's not forget the payout 
      of Mr Davies' and Mr Scott's Arrow performance rights, which garner them 
      $1.28 million and $2.9 million respectively.
      Mr Davies, who will be 
      Dart's chairman, and Mr Scott and Mr Bizzell, who will transfer to Dart as 
      executive directors with Dart's managing director Simon Potter, will also 
      get a swag of Dart options.
      Mr Davies is entitled to 
      1.25 million, Mr Potter 3.65 million, and Mr Scott and Mr Bizzell will get 
      2.25 million each.
      A third of these options 
      will vest each year and they are exercisable at 25 per cent above Dart's 
      volume weighted average price over the past week, its first as a separate 
      listed entity on the stock exchange.
      When Arrow listed at the 
      end of August 2000, it had just raised $5 million at 20c a share and it 
      had a market capitalisation of $10 million.
      Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina's bid of $4.70 a share capitalised 
      the company at close to $3.5 billion, while Arrow shareholders also got 
      one Dart share, worth 80c on market yesterday, for each two Arrow shares 
      they held.
      So shareholders will do 
      nicely, but none so nicely as several of the Arrow directors, particularly 
      energy industry veteran Jeremy Barlow.
      Mr Barlow sold 8.63 million 
      shares into the float, worth $40 million.
      Nick Davies sold some 5.52 
      million shares worth nearly $26 million and Stephen Bizzell sold 3.79 
      million shares, worth $17.8 million.
      Arrow directors and staff 
      also held a swag of options, 9.72 million in all, which were cancelled on 
      very favourable terms.
      The strike prices of the 
      options varied, from about 55c to $5.00. But all were cancelled at $5.87 
      less their attached exercise price - another nice little earner.
      Mr Barlow had 1.12 million 
      of these exercisable at $3 which were cancelled for $3228,724.
      Mr Bizzell had 750,000, 
      250,000 exercisable at $3, 250,000 at $3.50 and 250,000 at $4.00 - for 
      which he got $1,777,500.
      Arrow chairman John 
      Reynolds, who held 70,000 Arrow shares, sold into the takeover at 
      $329,000, also had a nice options parcel - 430,000 at the very low 
      exercise price of 57.2c, which brought him in $2,278,140.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      Attempts by rivals in the 
      Queensland coal seam gas business to consolidate the four competing 
      projects were only likely to increase BG 
      Group's lead in bringing its Curtis project to production, chief 
      executive Frank Chapman claimed yesterday.
      Speaking after BG released 
      its June quarter results in London on Wednesday night, Mr Chapman said the 
      company had no plans for consolidation in Australia. 
       We have the reserves, we 
      have the markets, we have the financial wherewithal, we know what we need 
      to do and how to do it. And really we've got the momentum,  he said.
       So there's no need for us 
      to go for consolidation irrespective of what the other parties do. 
      BG has consistently been 
      linked to speculation of an eventual combination of QCLNG with the Australia Pacific LNG project of Origin 
      Energy and United States company ConocoPhillips. Rival companies Santos and 
      Royal Dutch Shell, meanwhile, are now in 
      talks about a potential combination of their proposed Queensland 
      developments.
      BG made an unsuccessful 
      hostile bid for Origin in 2008, before eventually acquiring Queensland Gas 
      and Pure Energy Resources.
      No less than four LNG 
      developments are now earmarked for Queensland, and the state and federal 
      governments are believed to be eager to see some of the projects combined. 
      Analysts have suggested that Gladstone would be unlikely to support more 
      than two LNG developments in the medium term.
      Mr Chapman said BG did not 
      want to disrupt its progress with the project by having to rework its 
      studies and designs to incorporate another project. If other coal seam gas 
      players combined projects, BG's time advantage over its rivals would only 
      increase.
       If you've done a 
      feasibility study for a given scheme and then you decide actually you're . 
      . . going to put two sites together, you can't just run with the same 
      utilities layout, the same loading jetty layout,  Mr Chapman said.
       If you're going to get the 
      synergies and the value of amalgamation, you've got to roll those things 
      together, so you have to stop the clock on what you're doing and start 
      again. And so anyone doing that at this stage has to find value in the 
      proposition in a net present value sense, which . . . offsets the loss of 
      NPV by delay. 
      Mr Chapman also noted that, 
      unlike its Queensland rivals, BG has secured customers for all of its 
      forecast production from its initial two-train, or processing line, 
      development.
      He said BG also had 
      sufficient reserves to cover production from its first two trains, while 
      he was confident that upcoming exploration in Queensland would prove up 
      enough reserves to support the eventual addition of a third train.
      BG plans to drill up to 48 
      exploration wells in previously untested areas this year, Mr Chapman said. 
      He said the company would also be open to tolling other companies' gas 
      through its LNG facilities once the project was up and running.
      Analysts have estimated 
      QCLNG could cost around $20 billion to build, with first production 
      forecast for 2014. BG remains confident of approving QCLNG for development 
      this year, despite Environment Minister Peter Garrett's decision to defer 
      his approval of the project pending further investigation of its impact on 
      underground water aquifers.
      Mr Garrett has pledged to 
      make a decision on both QCLNG and Santos' Gladstone LNG by October 11.
      BG has to date secured 
      buyers from China, Japan, Singapore and Chile for the project, putting it 
      well ahead of its rivals.
      On a bright note for those 
      competitors, Mr Chapman said he saw strong demand growth emerging in the 
      LNG market from 2014.

      ORIGIN ENERGY has bulked up 
      its reserves of gas, which the company hopes to export through a massive 
      liquefied natural gas plant in southern Queensland.
      However, the market remains 
      more interested in whether the company can secure a long-term customer for 
      the gas. 
      The company yesterday 
      revealed it had boosted gas reserves by 38 per cent over the financial 
      year, to 6207 petajoules, as preparations continue at its $35 billion LNG 
      joint venture with ConocoPhillips.
      As it also handed down a 
      solid production report for the June quarter, Origin said the reserves 
      increase was proof of good progress at the joint venture, known as Australia Pacific LNG. But the planned APLNG 
      project - which aims to make its first shipment in 2015 - continues to lag 
      rivals planning to export LNG from the area's coal-seam gas fields.
      Nearby projects run by 
      BG Group and Santos, for example, have 
      both strengthened their prospects by signing up buyers.
      Analysts say Origin's share 
      price will fail to reflect the massive growth potential of the project 
      until APLNG also signs up a big gas customer.
      Further putting pressure on 
      Origin to find a buyer, reports have surfaced that Shell is considering 
      buying into the Santos project, after acquiring Arrow Energy for $3.5 
      billion.
      Among its producing oil and 
      gas assets, Origin posted a 10 per cent increase in annual revenue to $632 
      million.
      Over the quarter, 
      production rose 28 per cent, driven by higher output from its BassGas 
      project and stronger production from its coal-seam gas assets.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"
      OIL giant Chevron 
      says it has found enough gas to build another liquefied natural gas 
      production plant at the $43 billion Gorgon LNG project site in Western 
      Australia, potentially raising development costs at the nation's biggest 
      resource project beyond $50bn.
      Chevron and its partners ExxonMobil 
      and Shell have approved construction of the first three production plants 
      or ``trains'' at Gorgon, but have said there is room at the site on Barrow 
      Island to build two more. 
      Chevron's executive vice-president of upstream 
      and gas, George Kirkland, said recent exploration success in the region 
      had increased the chance of expansion.
      ``I believe we have enough 
      gas already for the fourth train,'' Mr Kirkland told analysts in the US 
      after Chevron released its second-quarter 
      earnings report on Friday. ``I didn't say that I had all the partners on 
      board on that, but I believe that.''
      An extra train at Gorgon 
      could cost $10bn and would require gas discoveries totalling 5 trillion 
      cubic feet of gas or more, based on analyst's estimates for similar 
      projects in WA.
      Last week, Goldman 
      Sachs JBWere analysts estimated Chevron had proved up between 6 and 7 trillion 
      feet of gas in recent drilling to feed both Gorgon and the neighbouring 
      Wheatstone LNG project, which is yet to be approved.
      A fourth train at Gorgon 
      would boost production to 20 million tonnes of LNG a year, surpassing the 
      16 million tonnes the Woodside-operated North West Shelf exports each 
      year.
      Based on Gorgon's current 
      production schedule, with LNG from the first train is due in 2014 and the 
      second and third trains at six months intervals, a fourth train could be 
      on line in 2015 or 2016 if approved soon.
      Mr Kirkland said $US24bn of 
      contracts had already been awarded for Gorgon. Chevron is targeting a 2011 final investment 
      decision for its Wheatstone project, but indicated this date could be 
      brought forward.
      ``We would like to 
      accelerate it, if possible,'' Mr Kirkland said, adding that the company 
      was seeking environmental approvals. ``We're very, very pleased with our 
      progress, we're clicking off all the milestones that we need to, and we're 
      pushing to move it forward as quickly as we can,'' he said.
      Mr Kirkland said the 
      company was targeting sales for 90 per cent of its Wheatstone gas before 
      approval. ``We're 80 per cent at Wheatstone, we're very, very close,'' he 
      said. ``That gives us a lot of confidence that we can move forward.''

      Confirmation that gas plays 
      Bow Energy and Liquefied Natural Gas are in talks to revive 
      the stalled Fisherman's Landing LNG project in Queensland have fuelled 
      speculation that Bow could be in play.
      The Australian Financial 
      Review yesterday revealed that LNG Ltd 
      believed it was about a month away from locking in a deal over Fisherman's 
      Landing, with market rumours suggesting a deal with Bow was the most 
      likely outcome. 
      Yesterday, Bow and LNG Ltd confirmed to the Australian Stock 
      Exchange that they were in talks with one another.
       Bow advises that it has 
      been in discussions with the board of LNG 
      Ltd on a number of potential commercial arrangements,  Bow said in 
      a statement.
      But Wilson HTM analyst John 
      Young said confirmation of the talks could spur interest in Bow from 
      Queensland's existing LNG proponents such as BG 
      Group, who could use Bow's reserves to underpin future expansions 
      of their proposed developments.
       It's possible as a result 
      of discussions progressing with LNG Ltd 
      that this may trigger interest from some of the other parties . . . who 
      might think they don't want that gas locked up into a small-scale LNG 
      project,  Mr Young said.
      Bow is the largest holder 
      of coal seam gas reserves in Queensland not already aligned to one of the 
      state's proposed LNG projects.
      LNG Ltd, meanwhile, had been working with Arrow 
      Energy to develop a small-scale plant at LNG 
      Ltd's Fisherman's Landing site fed with coal seam gas from Arrow's 
      Queensland acreage. That alliance fell apart after international energy 
      giants Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina 
      launched a $3.4 billion takeover bid for Arrow.
      While the large-scale LNG 
      developments proposed for Queensland by the likes of BG 
      Group, Santos and Origin are yet to receive full environmental 
      approvals, LNG Ltd already has almost all 
      of its required permits.
      Any amalgamation of the Bow 
      and LNG Ltd projects would, however, 
      place a financial burden on the pair. Arrow, which was far larger than Bow 
      is now, had been looking at raising over $2 billion when it was working on 
      Fisherman's Landing. The pressure of such large financing contributed to 
      its pursuit of a deal with Shell and PetroChina.
      The pair would also need to 
      secure a committed customer for the plant's production, something that 
      both Santos and Origin have been struggling to secure for their own LNG 
      projects recently.
      LNG Ltd managing director Maurice Brand last 
      week said the company was in talks with potential partners who could help 
      finance the development and contribute to securing sales contracts.
      Shares in Bow climbed 7Â¢ to 
      $1.36 yesterday. LNG rose 8.5Â¢ to 68Â¢.

      already aligned to a state LNG project."
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      Australia's offshore 
      petroleum operators have been placed on high alert Â­after a surge in 
      accidental releases of natural gas prompted a safety warning from the 
      national industry watchdog.
      The worrying jump in 
      uncontrolled leaks comes as the industry is already under fire for 
      inadequate safety and environmental performance in the wake of the Montara 
      oil spill last year and BP's Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of 
      Mexico in April. 
      The National Offshore 
      Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) received 22 reports of uncontrolled oil 
      or gas leaks in the first six months of the year, almost as many as in the 
      whole of 2009. Three involved leaks of more than 300 kilograms of gas.
      The regulator identified a 
      lack of preventive maintenance and of routine inspections, and inadequate 
      training, among the most common causes of the incidents. It also pointed 
      to incorrect procedures or inadequate following of procedures.
      The oil and gas industry is 
      already suffering from a public crisis of confidence after the Montara oil 
      spill last year in the Timor Sea, the Varanus Island gas blast in 2008 and 
      BP's fatal rig explosion in April, federal Resources Minister Martin 
      Ferguson said in May.
      The minister has yet to 
      release a report of an independent investigation into the Montara accident 
      which is expected to trigger a tightening up of regulations and 
      procedures. Mr Ferguson has also flagged he will seek to introduce a 
      single regulator for the offshore oil and gas industry.
      An investigation by NOPSA 
      into the 2008 accident at Apache's Varanus Island hub off Western 
      Australia partly blamed the explosion on poor protection of a section of a 
      pipeline and ineffective inspection and monitoring by Apache.
      While most of the incidents 
      in the first half of the year involved small Â­releases that took place 
      over Â­extended periods of time and posed a minimal safety threat, 
       these Â­releases are often found to be the Â­precursors of far more 
      serious events , NOPSA warned in a safety alert. The regulator did not 
      identify the companies involved.
      Figures from the second 
      quarter show double the average number of reported gas releases, said 
      NOPSA chief executive Jane Cutler.
      Of the 22 reports of 
      uncontrolled oil or gas releases in the January-June Â­period, 20 were 
      gas releases and 16 occurred on ships moored at offshore fields to collect 
      oil and gas.
      Some of the leak reports 
      referred to repeat failures, causing NOPSA to query whether lessons were 
      being learnt from accidents and whether prevention measures were in 
      place.
      Many of the leaks occurred 
      when equipment was being restarted after planned or unplanned 
      shutdowns.
      The regulator has written 
      to all the operators involved and its inspection program for the rest of 
      the year will include a focus on hydrocarbon Â­releases and their root 
      causes, Ms Cutler said in a newsletter.
       Industry leaders and 
      operators should take this as a timely prompt to improve their 
      occupational health and safety performance,  she wrote."
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"
      You have probably never 
      heard of oilman George Mitchell, but more than anyone else, he has changed 
      the global energy outlook.
      In 1981, Mitchell's small 
      petroleum company faced dwindling natural gas reserves. He proposed a 
      radical idea â€“ drill deeper in the company's Texas fields to reach 
      gas-bearing shale rock more than a mile down. Because the gas was tightly 
      packed, most engineers believed it was too costly to extract 
      profitably. 
      After nearly two decades of 
      trying, Mitchell proved his doubters wrong. The result: the world has far 
      more available natural gas than anyone suspected.
      The BP oil spill cast a 
      cloud over almost all energy news. Well, shale gas is good news. Here's 
      why. Until recently, scarce US natural gas reserves suggested rising 
      dependence on expensive foreign supplies of liquefied natural gas. No 
      more.
      Next, natural gas emits 
      about 50 per cent less carbon dioxide â€“ the major greenhouse gas â€“ than 
      coal. Substituting gas for coal in electricity plants could temper 
      emissions.
      Finally, shale gas in 
      Europe and Asia has huge geopolitical implications. It could reduce 
      dependence on Russian natural gas and frustrate any gas cartel mimicking 
      the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
      How much shale gas exists 
      is unknown, but estimates are huge. The Potential Gas Committee is a group 
      of geologists who regularly estimate future US gas supplies. In 2000, its 
      estimate equalled 54 years of present annual consumption; by 2008, it was 
      almost 90 years.
       This isn't the end,  says 
      Colorado School of Mines geologist John Curtis. Globally, one study 
      estimated the recoverable supply at 16,200 trillion cubic feet, more than 
      150 times today's annual world gas use.
      Natural gas provides about 
      a quarter of US energy use â€“ for home heating, electricity generation and 
      factories. This will probably increase, but the emerging shale boom faces 
      two problems.
      The first is hype. Shale 
      gas has many virtues, but gains will come at the margin. It isn't a 
      panacea for every energy ailment.
      Environmentalists are 
      split. Some favour shale gas as a desirable  bridge fuel  until non-carbon 
      energy expands. Others argue gas drilling will threaten drinking water 
      supplies. That was a theme of the film Gasland.
      The charges seem overblown. 
      As the BP spill reaffirmed, all drilling requires regulation. There are 
      environmental issues, especially the safe disposal of  fracing fluids . 
      But onshore drilling has proceeded for decades without polluting water 
      supplies. In shale gas, thousands of feet typically separate shale 
      deposits from water tables.
      George Mitchell's 
      persistence made shale gas a huge geological gift. Only fools would 
      discard it."

      Crane Group, maker of plastic pipes and 
      bathroom fittings, is relying on demand from Western Australia's and 
      Queensland's natural gas, coal, gold and iron ore industries to boost 
      future sales after reporting a 14 per cent drop in 2010 pre-tax profit to 
      $48.2 million. 
      Sales in all the group's 
      core businesses, which include Tradelink plumbing stores, dropped in the 
      12 months to June 30, with total revenue down 12 per cent to $1.86 
      billion.
      Financial director Mark 
      Fitzgerald said the company had a  particularly difficult  first half as 
      demand for its products from the civil construction and mining sectors 
      dropped sharply after companies cut back on capital spending and delayed 
      projects.
       Sales volume has again 
      been the key issue this year,  he said.
      Earnings before significant 
      items, financing costs and tax in its pipeline division â€“ which last year 
      was the biggest contributor to profits â€“ halved to $37.1 million. 
      Tradelink made the stronger profit contribution this year, with earnings 
      up 15 per cent to $41 million.
      Crane also took a $3.1 million one-off charge 
      to reflect changes in New Zealand tax laws, which no longer allow 
      companies to claim depreciation on buildings.
      However, Crane managing 
      director Greg Sedgwick said sales in most divisions had improved over the 
      past six months and he expected 2011 net profit after tax before one-off 
      charges to be higher than 2010.
      The company believes 
      Australia will see  moderate  growth in 2011, with good growth in housing, 
      manufacturing and mining.
      Demand is rebounding most 
      strongly from the mining sector, with Crane last week awarded a contract 
      worth several hundred million dollars to supply WA's Gorgon Project. WA 
      contributes about 15 per cent of Crane's total sales. Crane 
      is starting to see skills shortages re-emerge in WA and is having 
      difficulty retaining workers in the state as people leave to take jobs in 
      the mining industry.
      Although focused on 
      Australia and New Zealand, Crane benefited from overseas contracts, 
      including a $3Â million contract to supply pipes to an urbanisation 
      project on Hong Kong Island run by the Hong Kong government, the Wan Chai 
      redevelopment. It is also looking for opportunities in the Middle East, 
      including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.
      In New Zealand, which 
      contributed one-fifth of Crane's total sales, the market was stabilising 
      after three years of decline, Mr Sedgwick said.
      But contracts for pipelines 
      to supply water in regional Australia, which are funded by the federal 
      government, were flat, with the group having no new orders to announce. 
      The outlook for water projects is expected to remain uncertain until after 
      the election.
      Earnings before interest 
      and taxation in Crane's Tradelink business rose 18 per cent to $41 
      million, despite lower sales, and profit margins widened as the group cut 
      costs and redesigned some of its 220 stores. Consumers have been buying 
      Tradelink's toilets and hand basins as they renovate homes and add more 
      bathrooms.
      Analysts said the group's 
      earnings were in line with expectations, and the timing of a recovery in 
      civil construction and water infrastructure activity will be key for 2011 
      and 2012 earnings.
      Citigroup said it was  cautious  about the 
      outlook for Crane's pipelines due to rising competition and low volumes, 
      but that its Tradelink business should benefit from a rebound in the 
      housing market.
      Crane's shares closed up 41Â¢ at $8.79.

      MINING BRISBANE, Aug 4 AAP 
      - The Queensland government will ban the use of BTEX chemicals in coal 
      seam gas extraction.
      BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, 
      Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) are a group of chemicals found mainly in 
      petroleum products. 
      An underground coal 
      gasification (UCG) pilot plant at Kingaroy, 210km northwest of Brisbane, 
      was closed down earlier this month after traces of the cancer-causing 
      chemicals benzene and toluene were found in bores near the plant.
      Farmers concerned about the 
      impact of mining in the state's food bowl regions plan to march on state 
      parliament in Brisbane on Wednesday.
      Mines Minister Stephen 
      Robertson told state parliament the ban was being imposed for the 
      protection of the community and the environment.
       It is our commitment to 
      legislate to ban them from ever being used in Queensland,  he said.
       The message is very clear, 
      no one is allowed to use these chemicals in the extraction of coal seam 
      gas.
       I will also be writing to 
      all companies involved in (coal seam gas) extraction to advise them of the 
      new requirements and regulations. 
      Greens Senate candidate and 
      environmental lawyer Larissa Waters earlier on Wednesday said coal seam 
      gas mining and UCG should not proceed at the expense of food production, 
      water security, endangered species or the climate.

      BROWSE PERTH, Aug 4 AAP - 
      The threat of compulsory acquisition continues to loom over the site of a 
      proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) hub in far north Western Australia, 
      Premier Colin Barnett says.
      Traditional Aboriginal 
      owners in the Kimberley voted on Tuesday to continue with a native title 
      claim on the site of the LNG hub albeit with different applicants.
   
      The LNG gas hub earmarked 
      for James Price Point, 60km north of Broome, is a Woodside 
      Petroleum-led venture to process gas from the Browse Basin off the 
      Kimberley coast.
      In April 2009 the Kimberley 
      Land Council (KLC) signed a heads of agreement with Woodside and the state 
      and federal governments approving the LNG gas hub.
      However native title 
      claimant Joseph Roe prompted a breakdown in negotiations in June this year 
      by seeking to prevent the KLC from representing the claimants.
      On Monday, the Federal 
      Court dismissed legal action by Mr Roe against the KLC paving to way for 
      the negotiations to continue.
      Mr Barnett said the 
      government had never stopped negotiations and were always determined to 
      see the LNG gas project developed.
       It means literally 
      thousands of jobs for West Australians, thousands of contracts for small 
      to medium-sized businesses and enormous economic and social benefit for 
      the Aboriginal people,  he said in Perth on Wednesday.
      He said the project is 
      worth $1.5 billion over 30 years and would be put into health, education 
      and training in the area.
      But although the legal 
      dispute regarding the KLC had been resolved, Mr Barnett said the state 
      government would still be prepared to acquire the site through compulsory 
      acquisition if necessary.
       I don't see anything 
      particularly onerous about compulsory acquisition,  he said.
       It's nothing unusual for 
      any sort of public works whether it be a road or pipeline, power station 
      or industrial site as this is for the state to acquire the land. 
      Mr Barnett said James Price 
      Point is not an area that has native title established on it.
       It is vacant Crown land, 
      it belongs to the state.

      TRADITIONAL owners in the

      The meeting follows a 
      Federal Court decision in Perth dismissing legal action by native title 
      claimant Joseph Roe against the Kimberley Land Council.
      Mr Roe had sought to 
      prevent the KLC from representing native title claimants in negotiations 
      over the proposed hub 60 kilometres north of Broome.
      The Goolarabooloo man and

      ENERGY: Santos is trying to 
      secure debt from foreign export credit agencies such as US 
      Export-Import Bank to help fund the $16 billion Gladstone Liquefied 
      Natural Gas project in Queensland.
      Departing chief financial 
      officer Peter Wasow said Santos was on track to complete financing and 
      make a final investment decision this year. 
      ``We're looking at 
      borrowing money from export credit agencies,'' Mr Wasow told The 
      Australian yesterday.
      ``One example is the US -- 
      it is going to be providing a lot of engineering services and technical 
      know-how, and we'll be able to borrow money from the US government at a 
      subsidised rate to reflect their desire to promote their export to our 
      project.''
      He said the option was just 
      one of many the company was looking at including bank financing, hybrid 
      debt and, if needed, an equity raising.
      Mr Wasow said the necessity 
      for an equity raising would not be clear until negotiations with potential 
      partners had finalised Santos's stake in the project.
      Santos has not announced a 
      recent cost estimate for the project, of which it owns 60 per cent, but 
      analysts are forecasting about $16 billion.
      Yesterday, Mr Wasow 
      announced he would step down at the end of the year, by which time he 
      hoped to have tied up the financing of the GLNG project.
      ``The end of the year will 
      be a very important time for Santos. We will have taken the final 
      investment decision on Gladstone and I will have completed the funding, so 
      it's a logical time to make a swap,'' he said.
      Mr Wasow, 51, said he had 
      been proud to have been at Santos for the past eight years, during which 
      time it had grown from a top 50 domestically focused company to a top 30 
      firm, removed its ownership cap and was now looking at multiple LNG export 
      projects.
      ``There's nothing untoward 
      -- it's time to move on and you need new challenges,'' he said.
      Santos chief executive 
      David Knox said Mr Wasow had been keen a key member of the management team 
      that had built Santos into a leading energy company."

      Santos is not a company 
      without its share of headwinds. It has been trying, without success, for 
      over a year to find a new long-term customer for its proposed $16 billion 
      Gladstone liquefied natural gas project. It faces the need for a second 
      $1Â billion-plus equity raising in as many years as it shores up its 
      balance sheet for the construction period ahead. And to top things off, 
      federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett has raised concerns about the 
      environmental impact of Gladstone, demanding more details from Santos 
      before he will make a decision on whether to allow the project's 
      development. 
      But despite all that, 
      Santos looks a compelling investment proposition in the eyes of most 
      analysts.
      According to Bloomberg, 
      only one of the 16Â analysts that cover Santos rates it a  sell . 
      Instead, 13 rate the company a  buy , the remaining two a  hold , with an 
      average price target of $15.96.
      The reason for the 
      popularity is a combination of its recent share price weakness and the 
      lift to earnings that will flow from its growing LNG portfolio from around 
      2014. Santos's 13.5 per cent stake in the under-construction Papua New 
      Guinea LNG project will get things moving, but it is the 60 per cent-owned 
      Gladstone LNG project that is the main game.
      With the government's 
      resources tax uncertainty now resolved, there is increasing confidence 
      that positive price catalysts could be on the horizon.
      Santos was reportedly on 
      the cusp of an LNG supply deal with Korea 
      Gas earlier this year, but the buyer was spooked at the last minute 
      by the government's resources super profits tax. With that uncertainty now 
      removed, many observers believe a Kogas 
      deal may not be far away.
      Of even greater long-term 
      significance is the company's rumoured deal with Royal Dutch Shell. Shell, together with PetroChina, is hoping to develop its own LNG 
      project on Curtis Island in central Queensland, just a stone's throw from 
      Santos's Gladstone LNG site.
      While the pair are believed 
      to be in negotiations, it's too early to tell if a deal will come 
      together.
      The rationale for 
      discussions is apparent to analysts, who believe a combination of the 
      pair's Queensland projects would solve many of Santos' issues.  We view 
      this as a logical tie-up â€“ Shell brings its balance sheet, LNG execution 
      experience and large potential customer in PetroChina, and Santos brings a more mature 
      project in terms of approvals and contracting a workforce, upstream [coal 
      seam gas] operating experience and a customer in Petronas,  JPMorgan 
      analyst Ben Wilson says.
      CLSA analyst Di Brookman 
      says Santos brings the best of the four LNG sites identified in 
      Queensland.  If true, it certainly appears that Shell sees the value in 
      the project that the market has been struggling to see,  says Ms Brookman, 
      who has a price target on the stock of $18.82.
       If this deal can be 
      announced, it removes two key issues â€“ equity risk, as we believe they 
      will be fully funded, and execution risk, given Shell's vast operating 
      experience. 
      UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay notes that Shell and 
      Santos's 40 per cent partner in Gladstone, Malaysia's Petronas, have a 
      history of working together on LNG in Malaysia.  Shell has grandiose 
      ambitions for CSG [coal seam gas] to LNG on Curtis Island and linking up 
      with Santos would provide a solution that would help Shell deliver the 16 
      million tonnes per annum LNG project that it has been proposing,  he 
      says."

      Santos chief financial 
      officer Peter Wasow has vowed to wrap up the rest of the company's funding 
      commitments â€“ including the crucial sale of a stake in its flagship 
      Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project â€“ before he leaves the oil 
      and gas producer.
      Adelaide-based Santos 
      yesterday said the highly respected Mr Wasow would retire at the end of 
      the year after eight years as CFO. 
      The 51-year-old's departure 
      comes at a sensitive time for Santos, which is planning to make a final 
      investment decision on its $15 billion GLNG project by December 31. But Mr 
      Wasow said he expected to have secured the funding necessary to support 
      GLNG's development before he handed over to his successor.
       I'm quite confident that 
      in the time I've got left, we'll be able to close the remainder of the 
      funding plan,  Mr Wasow said.  The funding plan is well advanced and will 
      be completed before [a final investment decision] at the end of the 
      year. 
      It was  critical  that 
      Santos complete the sale of an equity stake in GLNG to shore up its own 
      finances and cut its share of capital expenditure at the project, he 
      said.
      Santos, which has raised 
      $7.5Â billion in the last 1 Â½ years to advance its LNG projects, has 
      previously said it would reduce its stake in GLNG from 60 per cent to as 
      little as 41 per cent.
      Mr Wasow said the timing 
      would be right to hand over the CFO role once GLNG was sanctioned.
       I've had a number of 
      approaches from different people to go and work for different companies 
      from time to time,  he said.  But I've always turned them back, because 
      with Santos the GLNG project was the last milestone that we needed to 
      reach to totally remake this company from what we started with at the 
      beginning of the decade. 
      CLSA analyst Di Brookman 
      said Mr Wasow had been well liked by the market.  When you have big 
      projects like this, you don't want to see too many changes,  Ms Brookman 
      said.
      Mr Wasow, an avid motorbike 
      rider, said he was planning to spend more time riding.  I've been fully 
      invested in Santos for eight years and need to invest some time in 
      non-business things for a while,  he said.
      Santos has started an 
      internal and external search for a successor."

      - Queensland environmentalists and farmers have called for a moratorium on 
      the process of  fracking  in the extraction of coal seam gas, following a 
      similar decision in New York.
      According to the New York 
      Times, the New York State Senate voted 48 to 9 on Tuesday night to issue a 
      temporary moratorium on the natural gas exploration, which uses hydraulic 
      fracturing and the injection of millions of gallons of chemically treated 
      water underground. 
      The moratorium has been put 
      in place to give time for a review of safety and environmental 
      concerns.
      Friends of the Earth 
      spokesman Drew Hutton said Queensland farmers and environmentalists were 
      also concerned by the process, which involved setting off explosions 
      underground to better release the coal seam gas.
       There is no difference 
      between the fracking process in the US and here in the Surat Basin,  Mr 
      Hutton said.
       The same companies are 
      doing it, the same chemicals are being used and there is a similar 
      reluctance on the part of the companies to tell communities, or even the 
      regulators, what chemicals are in the fracking fluids.
       The Bligh government 
      should protect the public interest in the same way as the New York 
      legislature and conduct the same review of this controversial 
      process.

       We've been calling on a

      impacts on the Great Artesian Basin,  he said.
       (The state government) 
      don't appear to be doing a lot of in-depth studies. 
      Mr Hayllor said the state 
      government's announcement on Wednesday to ban the use of BTEX chemicals in 
      coal seam gas extraction didn't go far enough.
      An underground coal 
      gasification (UCG) pilot plant at Kingaroy, 210km northwest of Brisbane, 
      was closed down earlier this month after traces of the cancer-causing BTEX

      However Mines Minister 
      Stephen Robertson re-affirmed the government stance on the coal seam gas 
      industry on Friday, saying  we want it to grow .
       But as I have said 
      repeatedly it cannot be at any cost,  he said.
       The resource sector must 
      comply with Queensland regulations and laws and it must show our 
      environment and Queensland landholders the respect that they deserve.

      MEET Larissa Waters, the 
      fresh face of the Greens in Queensland, the state that has been slowest to 
      warm to them.
      She wants to extend 
      no-fishing zones, ban new coalmines, give priority to farm land over the 
      development of potentially rich coal-seam gas and underground coal 
      gasification fields, and tell sandminers they will be happier planting 
      trees or working in eco-tourism. 
      She is in furious agreement 
      with her leader, Bob Brown, that the pay of chief executives should be 
      capped and that carbon be priced through an interim tax.
      And she is better placed to 
      do what no other Green has done and get elected as senator for 
      Queensland.
      If the polls are borne out 
      on August 21, Ms Waters, 33, is Canberra-bound and will help deliver to 
      the Greens the balance of power in the next Senate.
      Not that she plans to use 
      it to wheel and deal with the government -- be it led by Julia Gillard or 
      Tony Abbott.
      That is not the Greens way, 
      Ms Waters says.
      ``We don't horse-trade. We 
      look at every proposal on its merits. We see how we can improve it, and if 
      we can't support it, we propose an alternative,'' she told The Weekend 
      Australian.
      It has been a big week for 
      the Brisbane environmental lawyer and mother.
      After appearing at the 
      Greens campaign launch last Sunday, her profile got another boost on ABC 
      TV's Q&A program, when it was broadcast from the Queensland capital 
      for the first time.
      Ms Waters got an easier 
      time on the panel than South Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young 
      did in June, after the Labor leadership change.
      Legendary ALP numbers man 
      and former federal environment minister Graham Richardson went to town on 
      Senator Hanson-Young after she trumpeted the Greens' decision last year to 
      side with the Coalition and block the then-Rudd government's emissions 
      trading scheme, dooming the legislation and arguably Kevin Rudd's prime 
      ministership.
      Mr Richardson said the 
      Greens' ``absolutism'' was the reason they hadn't made bigger inroads into 
      parliament. ``They don't achieve . . . if all you continue to achieve is 
      nothing, then all I can say is God help the lot of us, and that's what 
      happening now,'' he said.
      Ms Waters' election in 
      Queensland is key to the Greens' hopes to increase their current tally of 
      five in the Senate, when they are certain to have the balance of power in 
      their own right.
      She hit back at Mr 
      Richardson, saying his critique of the Greens was ``just a Labor Party 
      line that doesn't mount up to facts''.
      Asked what she hoped to 
      achieve if the Greens stayed on the path outlined by Mr Richardson and 
      shunned compromise, Ms Waters said: ``Well, the Greens aren't in charge of 
      the government. The . . . Greens in the balance of power will only ever 
      have a say when the two big parties haven't ganged up together . . . it's 
      only when the major parties don't agree, and frankly they agree on an 
      awful lot of things, that our numbers come into play.''
      She said she would ``always 
      put Queensland's interests first'' if elected, but was unable to say when 
      a Greens senator had crossed the floor on an issue that clashed with the 
      party's position.

      CONCERNS about water 
      contamination have forced New York to temporarily ban a controversial 
      process similar to one used by the Queensland coal seam gas industry.
      The fracking process in 
      Queensland, which uses water, sand and a mostly unknown list of chemicals, 
      fractures the coal to allow the harvest of gas and has caused substantial 
      concern in the US because of the potential to contaminate drinking 
      water. 
      Queensland farmers fear 
      fracking will ruin farms and contaminate the underground water on which 
      they rely.
      The farmers also fear salt 
      contamination of their land and waterways caused by the brine that is 
      brought to the surface when harvesting the gas.
      Earlier this week, about 
      300 farmers and environmentalists marched on State Parliament in an 
      attempt to force the Government to issue its own moratorium on the 
      industry until the science of the process was better understood.
      In New York, the shale gas 
      industry, which differs from coal seam gas in geology and process, has 
      faced similar criticism of polluted ground and surface water and companies 
      now face fines and civil action.
      The New York senate voted 
      to stall further work to ensure an adequate review of safety and 
      environmental concerns while its Environmental Protection Agency is 
      holding its own hearings on the process.
      American environmentalist 
      Tara Meixsall, on tour in Queensland, said shale gas schemes were so bad 
      in Rocky Mountain states that people could light their tap water, and were 
      getting ill..
      The gas industry has 
      maintained the Australian experience is safe, proven technology.
      Australian Petroleum 
      Production and Exploration Association chief executive Belinda Robinson 
      said the technology was the same and there had been a ``noisy campaign of 
      misinformation and ignorance''.
      ``This technology has been 
      practised safely for decades and repeatedly found to be safe technology. 
      If any Australian government were to cave in to this intellectually 
      lacking and evidence-shy campaign, then no industry is safe.''
      But Friends of the Earth 
      spokesman Drew Hutton said the coal seam gas industry was an 
      ``uncontrolled experiment''.
      Mr Hutton said Queensland 
      farmers also worried the process would mean the underground water aquifers 
      would be severely damaged and possibly start contaminating each other.
      Mining and Resources 
      Minister Stephen Robertson said Queensland laws and stringent 
      environmental authorities only allow CSG fracturing to occur where it 
      would not have an adverse environmental impact."

      SMALL businesses are the 
      least likely to put an energy, water or environmental management plan in 
      place. And the high proportion of larger companies which do indicate that 
      price is a significant factor. Cost is the major barrier to improving 
      energy efficiency for almost a quarter of Australia's businesses and 
      barely more than half took steps in the past financial year to reduce 
      consumption, the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
      shows. Businesses spent more than $75billion on energy during 2008-09, 
      with the majority going to electricity and non-renewable fuel costs. But 
      the cost of ''green'' power continues to make it less attractive for 
      businesses, with the majority of spending on non- renewable energy. Diesel 
      accounted for $18billion, $13billion was spent on electricity and 
      $6billion on natural gas. Other non-renewable fuel mostly crude oil used 
      by the petroleum industry cost Australian companies $29billion. 
       In the same time frame, 
      just $60million was spent on renewable energy, such as biofuels, and 
      $95million on ''green'' electricity derived from hydro power or wind farms 
      less than 1per cent of total business energy expenditure. Energy 
      efficiency measures were implemented in 88per cent of larger companies,

      EASTERN MELBOURNE, Aug 9 
      AAP - Eastern Star Gas Ltd plans to raise 
      $100 million in fresh capital, and has flagged a reserve upgrade at its 
      Narrabri coal seam gas project in NSW.
      The energy company on 
      Monday announced plans to raise $100 million in a capital raising by 
      offering institutional investors 122 million new shares at 82 cents.
   
      The money will be used to 
      buy new land, explore for reserves and progress its Narrabri project, 
      Eastern Star said.
      Eastern Star has gone into 
      a trading halt on Monday. The stock traded last at 91.5 cents.
      Eastern Star managing 
      director David Casey said the placement would give Eastern Star $25 
      million funding to buy a site for its Newcastle liquefied natural gas 
      (LNG) project and to develop those plans.
      Another $34 million from 
      the placement would be used to complete feasibility studies and conduct 
      front-end engineering and design of the proposed LNG facility.
      About $48 million would be 
      used for ongoing exploration, evaluation and development, and the 
      expansion of the Wilga Park Power Station, near Narrabri.
      The $15 million balance 
      would go to corporate and other costs, Eastern Star said.
      The capital raising is 
      fully underwritten.
      Eastern Star's main 
      activity currently is its 65 per cent interest in the PEL 238 licence area 
      at Narrabri, which is in pilot production.
      Gas giant Santos owns the 
      remaining 35 per cent of PEL 238.
      Eastern Star on Monday also 
      issued its quarterly report. The company did not alter its proven and 
      probable gas reserve estimates of 1,520 petajoules at Narrabri, but it did 
      flag an upgrade to resources at PEL 238 this year.
       Further upgrading of 
      reserves will take place during 2010 in PEL 238 through an ongoing 
      corehole program and production from multi-lateral production pilots,  the 
      company said.

      LAND owners at Tara have

      About 15 people yesterday 
      blocked Queensland Gas workers who were doing seismic testing for a gas

      It hasn't been the busiest 
      of years for equity capital markets but with Nathan Tinkler's Aston 
      Resources now done and dusted, whispers of a couple of other 
      raisings are growing louder.
      While the Credit 
      Suisse-advised Cockatoo Coal is 
      the next one set to press the button in the coal sector â€“ to fund the 
      acquisition and development of Anglo Coal's Surat Basin coal reserves â€“ 
      RBS Morgans and Credit Suisse were 
      working away on another raising at about the $100 million mark over the 
      weekend. It's believed Eastern Star Gas is preparing to come to the 
      market. The company, which is exploring the development of a small-scale 
      liquefied natural gas plant at the port of Newcastle in NSW alongside its 
      Japanese partners, Hitachi and Toyo 
      Engineering, had $31.5 million cash left at the end of the June 
      quarter. The coal seam gas player is also planning a $500Â million 
      pipeline from Narrabri to Newcastle. 
      Eastern Star, which is 19 
      per cent owned by Santos, is aiming to complete a feasibility study into 
      the plan by the end of next year. The company hopes to start exporting gas 
      by 2014. A raising to top up funds fits with managing director David 
      Casey's plan for the company to start transitioning to development and 
      production. Shares in Eastern Star have declined 10 per cent in the past 
      year, and closed at 91.5Â¢ on Friday."

      Advent Energy's plans to 
      test a possible big natural gas province off the coast of Sydney is 
      attracting interest from larger oil and gas groups that want to join in 
      the promising exploration.
      The potential partners 
      would join unlisted Advent and its partner Bounty Oil & Gas in drilling what will be 
      the first gas exploration well offshore NSW. Drilling in the PEP11 permit, 
      the state's only offshore petroleum exploration licence, is due to start 
      in October at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. 
      Market interest in the well 
      has surged since early July when Advent released an updated estimate of 
      the targeted resource in the permit, doubling the volume of potential 
      recoverable gas to 13.2 trillion cubic feet. A discovery on the doorstep 
      of Australia's biggest energy market would drive a shift away from coal to 
      gas for power generation, cutting carbon emissions.
      Shares in MEC 
      Resources, which owns 51 per cent of Advent, have jumped 48 per 
      cent since the start of July, while Bounty Oil 
      & Gas has gained 13 per cent.
       We have received 
      approaches and we are evaluating them,  said David Breeze, an executive 
      director of both Advent andits 51 per cent shareholder MEC 
      Resources.
      He declined to say what 
      stake Advent, which now holds 85 per cent of the permit, may end up with 
      in the exploration venture. Bounty owns the other 15 per cent.  We are 
      evaluating what we might do relative to the sort of people who have 
      approached us,  Mr Breeze said. The PEP11 permit stretches about 200 
      kilometres from Wollongong south of Sydney up to Newcastle.
      Market interest in Advent 
      has been heightened by Talbot Group Holdings' 10 per cent stake. Talbot 
      was the private investment vehicle of mining magnate Ken Talbot, who was 
      killed in a plane crash in Congo in June. Talbot's other investments 
      include explorer Karoon Gas, whose shares 
      surged last year following discoveries off north-west Australia that may 
      underpin a liquefied natural gas project.
      Advent can also lay claim 
      to some important Chinese connections, through chairman Goh Hock, a former 
      Asia president of oilfield services major Schlumberger, and senior 
      advisory panel member Ding Guiming, a former head of exploration at China National Petroleum Corp.
      The expected start of 
      drilling around the Great White and Marlin prospects about 55 kilometres 
      east of Newcastle was recently delayed until early in the fourth quarter 
      after a deferral in the date the drill rig would become available. The 
      Ocean Patriot rig is now working for ExxonMobil at the $1 billion Kipper gas 
      development in Bass Strait. The final drilling location in PEP11 has yet 
      to be determined.
      Independent experts used by 
      Advent rate the chance of a discovery at the well at about 20 per cent, 
      although other technical indicators point to a much higher probability, 
      towards 80 per cent.
      If successful, a gas 
      discovery would have  immense significance  in terms of meeting the 
      government's goals for carbon dioxide emissions reductions, Mr Breeze 
      said.
      Easy access to cheap coal 
      resources in the Hunter Valley and technical difficulties in processing 
      seismic data from the offshore Sydney Basin have deterred any drilling 
      previously in waters off the NSW coast."

      Sydney-based Metgasco is 
      poised to become the next coal seam gas group pursuing liquefied natural 
      gas production as it explores the potential for exporting 3 million tonnes 
      a year from Queensland.
      Metgasco has focused to 
      date on defining coal seam gas reserves in its northern NSW acreage for 
      sale to gas-fired power plants. However, chief Â­financial officer 
      Glenda McLoughlin said it was now studying its LNG options. 
       We believe our acreage has 
      quite a significant gas resource, certainly it's LNG supply capable, so we 
      are looking at our LNG options, we're working on those right now 
      actually,  Ms McLoughlin said.
      The export of coal seam gas 
      allows companies to tap higher-priced gas markets in other countries, 
      compared with what can be received for gas on the east coast of 
      Australia.
      The possibility of 
      exporting coal seam gas as LNG has helped drive a boom in Queensland's gas 
      industry, inspiring more than $20 billion in Â­acquisitions by some of 
      the world's biggest oil and gas companies.
       We've really been doing 
      the work on defining our supply potential, and we've now got to a point 
      where we think we have quite a large resource that's going to be 
      sufficient for a 3 million tonne per annum plant,  Ms McLoughlin said.
       We're now looking at what 
      is the most commercial arrangement for that type of LNG [production]. 
      Metgasco involvement in LNG 
      Â­export would be a boost for NSW's coal seam gas sector which, despite 
      similar geological potential, has lagged Queensland's development.
      Fellow coal seam gas 
      explorer Eastern Star Gas has raised the prospect of developing a 
      mid-scale LNG plant at Port of Newcastle, one of the few NSW sites 
      suitable. Metgasco would bypass NSW as a home for an LNG plant and pick 
      southern Queensland.  We're about the same distance from Newcastle as we 
      are from Gladstone,  Ms McLoughlin said.
       Newcastle would not be our 
      preferred option. 
      Metgasco's talk of a 3 
      million tonne a year facility near Gladstone is bound to promote 
      speculation that the company is in talks with Perth-based Liquefied 
      Natural Gas Ltd.
      LNG Ltd is advancing the Fisherman's Landing 
      LNG project at a Gladstone site, which it believes can support two LNG 
      trains, or processing lines, of 1.5 million tonnes a year production 
      capacity each. It has been on the lookout for a potential supplier of gas 
      to the project after its previous partner, Arrow Energy, was bought by 
      Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina 
      for $3.4 billion.
      LNG Ltd managing director Maurice Brand said 
      last month the company had been talking to  every man and his dog with 
      gas . Queensland coal seam gas explorer Bow 
      Energy confirms it is in talks with LNG 
      Ltd.
      Ms McLoughlin said Metgasco 
      had had discussions with potential strategic partners.  We're finding 
      there's very strong interest in LNG supply from Australia, from Asian 
      countries.  Metgasco has defined 397 petajoules of proven and probable 
      reserves, and 2239 petajoules of proven, probable and possible 
      reserves."

      CLIMATE BRISBANE, Aug 10 
      AAP - The coal seam gas (CSG) industry being developed in Queensland could 
      create huge amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane, a Climate 
      Institute scientist says.
       It's so frustrating when I 
      hear that Queensland is opening up great swathes of country, of productive 
      land in particular, to coal seam gas production,  said Corey Watts, 
      regional projects manager with the Climate Institute. 
       With thousands of 
      potentially unregulated, unmonitored bores coming on-line in the next few 
      years, we could see a massive spike in Queensland's methane 
      emissions. 
      Mr Watts told a forum about 
      the future of Australia's grazing industries in Brisbane that  molecule 
      for molecule, methane is many times more potent a greenhouse pollutant 
      than carbon dioxide .
      In the past 160 years 
      methane levels had grown by 150 per cent and continue to do so.
       We are now at levels of 
      methane in the atmosphere that haven't been around for 600,000 years,  Mr 
      Watts said.
       Methane is thought to have 
      contributed to about a third of the (global) warming. 
      However methane drops out 
      of the atmosphere after a decade or so, much faster than carbon dioxide, 
      meaning it can bring quick and lasting relief and go towards preventing 
      runaway global warming, Mr Watts said.
      He said while grazing 
      industries are attempting to lower methane production, CSG will hugely 
      increase the amount in the atmosphere.

      only 20 per cent of Tasmanian households have access to natural gas.
       Running gas pipes through

      provide desperately needed natural gas infrastructure for Tasmanians,  he

       Natural gas costs about 
      half what electricity costs to heat a house and given that many Tasmanian

      announcement, the State Government-owned Newcastle Port Corporation expressed safety 
      concerns about the site, which has various potentially explosive 
      fertiliser plants as neighbours. 
      Eastern Star said it was 
      buying the land from one of them, Incitec 
      Pivot.
      A port corporation 
      spokesman said the organisation had  raised a number of safety and 
      operational issues with Eastern Star that, at this stage, have not been 
      adequately addressed .
      As well, its meetings with 
      Eastern Star had concerned the company's desire for a plant on the former 
      BHP Mayfield steelworks site, not Kooragang Island.
      An Eastern Star spokesman 
      said the company had commissioned a series of independent, specialist 
      reviews to assess the environmental, commercial and operational 
      considerations associated with an LNG plant on Kooragang Island, which had 
      confirmed the proposal was feasible.
      Now that an agreement to 
      acquire the land had been reached with the current owner, NSW Planning 
      would determine if an LNG plant could proceed at the site.
      As well as the land 
      purchase, Eastern Star announced it had raised $100 million yesterday by 
      selling new shares to investors.
      This money and another $31 
      million in the bank would pay for the Kooragang land and finance other 
      aspects of the Narrabri gas-fields project.
      Eastern Star would pay a 10 
      per cent non-refundable deposit on the Kooragang site but had an option to 
      exit the deal before January 14, 2011, if government approval for the 
      project did not eventuate.
      Eastern Star managing 
      director David Casey said yesterday the Kooragang land was big enough for 
      its long-term plans to export 4 million tonnes of gas a year."

      NSW coal seam gas explorer 
      Eastern Star Gas will dramatically step up its investigations into a 
      liquefied Â­natural gas development at Newcastle, in a move that could 
      stir up action from its major shareholder, Â­Santos.
      Eastern Star said it would 
      raise $100 million, of which $25 million would go towards acquiring a 
      Â­24-hectare industrial site at Kooragang Island at Newcastle.
 
      Eastern Star said the site 
      could host an LNG plant with a capacity of as much as 4 million tonnes a 
      year.
      Another $34 million will be 
      used to complete feasibility studies and advance front-end engineering and 
      design regarding the LNG development, while the remainder will cover 
      exploration and corporate costs.
      The raising, which was 
      revealed by The Australian Financial Â­Review, was carried out 
      yesterday through a book-build underwritten at 82Â¢ a share, or a 10.4 per 
      cent Â­discount to its closing price last Friday of 91.5Â¢.
      Analysts said the raising 
      and the acquisition of the Kooragang Island site could prove a catalyst 
      for Santos â€“ a 19.9 per cent shareholder in Eastern Star and owner of a 35 
      per cent stake in several of Eastern Star's NSW leases â€“ to make its 
      longer-term intentions for the company known.
      Santos does not have a seat 
      on the board of Eastern Star, leading to persistent speculation that a 
      move on the company could be likely.
      Santos is also poised to 
      approve the development of its 60 per cent-owned, $16 billion Gladstone 
      LNG project in Queensland by year's end and could be interested in 
      eventually feeding gas from Eastern Star's acreage into Gladstone.
       It may be that this draws 
      Santos towards a decision on whether it takes the gas north and brokers 
      some sort of agreement, or whether it even draws them into a takeover,  
      said one analyst who declined to be identified.
       I would think Santos is 
      probably more interested in getting this gas north to Gladstone, which is 
      definitely feasible, rather than exporting out of Newcastle.  Santos, 
      which learned of the capital raising plans only yesterday morning, 
      exercised its rights to maintain its 19.9 per cent stake.
      The company is already down 
      on its original investment in Eastern Star, which was made in July 2009 at 
      $1.02 per share.
      In May, Eastern Star 
      announced a heads of agreement with Japanese companies Hitachi and Toyo Engineering to investigate the development 
      of an initial 1 million tonne a year LNG project at Newcastle. The 
      companies aim to export gas from the port by 2014."

      BLOCKADE BRISBANE, Aug 11 
      AAP - Landowners and environmentalists have ended a blockade of a proposed 
      coal seam gas site in southern Queensland.
      This follows threats of 
      legal action by a major gas company at the centre of the project.
 
      Residents at Tara, west of 
      Brisbane, and Friends of the Earth activists blocked trucks carrying 
      equipment essential to the Queensland Gas 
      Company's (QGC) seismic testing in the gas rich Surat Basin over 
      environmental concerns.
      They say the project would 
      also severely reduce the value of their properties.
      The blockade began on 
      Sunday and ended on Wednesday following meetings between the two 
      sides.
      Friends of the Earth issued 
      a statement saying they have agreed to end the blockade after QGC promised 
      it would put on hold any exploration in Tara's rural residential estate 
      and enter negotiations with residents.
      Comments are being sought 
      from QGC.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      A ROGUE test result has 
      sparked concerns coal seam gas exploration is impacting on the water 
      supply of a western Queensland town.
      The Courier-Mail has learnt 
      that officers from the Western Downs Regional Council last week alerted 
      authorities about the sample at Dalby. 
      The water contained 
      fluoride at nine times the usual amount and salinity at a rate 10 per cent 
      above normal testing.
      The council alerted the 
      State Government's Office of Water Supply Regulation as well as CSG 
      producer Arrow Energy, which has nearby bores.
      The unusual sample is 
      certain to fuel fears about CSG among locals, who this week tried to form 
      a blockade and prevent another gas producer from conducting seismic 
      testing.
      Mayor Ray Brown said the 
      council was obliged to inform authorities about the sample but subsequent 
      tests had been taken.
      ``Those tests have come 
      back all within normal now,'' he said.
      Cr Brown said locals would 
      not have tasted anything different as the water was treated before going 
      to households.
      Natural Resources Minister 
      Stephen Robertson said fluoride occurred naturally and seasonal variations 
      could have affected samples.
      ``There is certainly no 
      suggestion that Arrow is responsible for that,'' he said.
      Mr Robertson said the 
      department would throw its efforts into finding what caused the 
      fluctuation.
      In a statement, an Arrow 
      energy spokeswoman said the company had not drilled any wells for either 
      exploration or production in the area for more than 12 months.
      She said the 
      higher-than-usual fluoride sample was still within current health 
      standards and below current dosing levels for urban water supplies.
      ``Arrow Energy has already 
      engaged two independent contractors to analyse further water samples to 
      confirm both fluoride and saline levels.''
      The Government is expected 
      to soon announce a new plan to protect prime cropping land from mining in 
      western Queensland."
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"
      THE Greens' Senator Bob 
      Brown yesterday described the destruction of the mining ghost town of 
      Acland as a ``horror'' and stepped up his attack on coal seam gas by 
      calling for a moratorium on the industry.
      His call came as Queensland Gas Co was promised it would get the 
      confrontation it has tried to avoid, with Tara's ``blockies'' vowing to 
      fight to keep the company away from their rural residential blocks.
   
      Friends of the Earth 
      members are expected to today join the protest, on a road about 40km from 
      Chinchilla, which has blockaded QGC's seismic testing equipment.
      Environmental activist Drew 
      Hutton, who is leading the campaign against the coal seam gas industry, 
      said the blockies were determined that this would be the fight that would 
      decide whether the gas companies would get access.
      Visiting the Darling Downs, 
      Senator Brown said the Greens would stand up for farming communities 
      against multinational miners.
      Senator Brown met Glenn 
      Beutel, the last resident of the town of Acland, who has defied pressure 
      to sell up and move on. Mr Beutel is still tending his gardens, though his 
      town is about to be swallowed up by New Hope's coalmine.
      Senator Brown said he would 
      challenge both major parties on their priority of putting coal before 
      food-producing farms in the Darling Downs."

      Employers are worried about 
      the Â­precedent set by a Fair Work Australia ruling that clears the way 
      for Â­legal strikes at Woodside 
      Petroleum's $13 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project.
      A decision by the FWA full 
      bench gave 12 crane drivers employed by contractor Mammoet Australia the 
      right to resume legally protected strikes in pursuit of a new enterprise 
      bargaining agreement. 
      The ruling overturned a 
      decision by FWA commissioner Brendan McCarthy suspending further strikes 
      for three months.
      The FWA full bench, led by 
      vice- president Michael Lawler, found the earlier decision had not applied 
      the correct test of what constituted  significant harm'' caused by 
      industrial action. The full bench ruled that harm to a third party had to 
      be  significant, that is [of] a more serious nature than merely suffering 
      of loss, inconvenience or delay'' and that FWA would only suspend 
      industrial action for that reason in  very rare cases''.
      Lawyers who represent 
      employers in such cases were reluctant to criticise the decision publicly, 
      but noted that Woodside faced losses of at least $3.5 million a day if the 
      project was delayed. The Mammoet workers are covered by the Construction 
      Forestry Mining and Energy Union and initially went on a 28-day strike in 
      April. The company Â­responded by locking them out before the case went 
      before FWA and work resumed.
      FWA found Woodside had 
       only a few days' buffer left in the project timeline before these losses 
      Â­begin to be incurred'', although some Â­delays were not related to 
      industrial action. But it found the potential daily losses were a function 
      of the project's enormous size and that it was  more likely than not'' 
      that the dispute would be resolved before further action was taken.
      It said the extra payments 
      sought by the employees amounted to $100,000, which was trivial in terms 
      of the whole project, although Woodside might be reluctant to agree 
      because it might Â­encourage employees of other contractors to seek 
      higher wage increases.
      The CFMEU's WA secretary, 
      Kevin Reynolds, said the ruling was a  very good decision'' because it 
      supported the right of workers to take Â­legally protected action. The 
      union yesterday withdrew notice of further industrial action, saying it 
      was confident agreement could be reached.
      Woodside spokesman Roger 
      Martin said Mammoet had made good progress since industrial action was 
      suspended on June 30 and was  in a position to pursue alternative options 
      to complete this scope of work .Woodside confident, page 49"

      Another round of industrial 
      action at Woodside Petroleum's $13 
      billion Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has been avoided, 
      protecting the project's delicately positioned budget and schedule.
      The Construction Forestry 
      Mining and Energy Union late yesterday withdrew its notice of a strike by 
      crane Â­operators employed by Woodside contractor Mammoet, in effect 
      cancelling a strike that had been set to begin tomorrow. 
      An earlier strike by 12 
      Mammoet crane operators came within a whisker of causing a delay and cost 
      blowout at Pluto, before a Fair Work Australia ruling ordered the 
      operators back to work.
      An appeal to FWA this week 
      found in favour of the CFMEU, which represents the crane operators, 
      clearing the way for the resumption of the strike. But with the critical 
      work required by the contractors already carried out, Woodside was likely 
      to be able to Â­absorb any further action.
      Of the 12 operators, only 
      four are believed to still be on site. According to the ruling from FWA, 
      the specialist heavy lifting tasks that could be carried out only by the 
      Mammoet operators are now fully complete.
       Since FWA ordered a 
      suspension of the industrial action on 30 June, Mammoet has made good 
      progress and our managing contractor is now in a position to pursue 
      alternative Â­options to complete this scope of work,  Woodside 
      spokesman Roger Martin said before the CFMEU withdrew its notice. In its 
      judgment, the FWA panel found Woodside could have avoided the original 
      strike by paying the $100,000 gap between the crane drivers' demand for a 
      7 per cent pay Â­increase and Mammoet's offer of a 5 per cent pay 
      increase.
       It may be inferred that 
      Woodside is reluctant to go down that path because it may encourage 
      employees of other contractors to seek higher wage Â­increases when the 
      opportunity arises than would otherwise be the case,  the panel said.
      Pluto is already looking 
      susceptible to cost blowouts and schedule delays, with Woodside warning 
      during the original Mammoet strike its budget Â­estimates were 
      contingent on the project not suffering from any more bouts of industrial 
      action. Woodside said in Â­November the original $11.2 billion budget 
      would blow out by 6 to 10 per cent due to  lower than budgeted 
      productivity . Since then the project has been hit by both an illegal 
      strike by 2000 Â­employees over accommodation, and the Mammoet 
      disruption.
      Woodside has already pushed 
      out its timetable for completing Pluto from the end of this year to March 
      2011, and has contingency plans in place to meet its LNG cargo delivery 
      obligations. Labour promises to be an increasingly important issue in 
      AustÂ­ralia's oil and gas industry, where several major LNG 
      developments are scheduled for construction.
      Goldman Sachs analyst Aiden Bradley last month 
      said LNG projects typically require 4500 to 10,000 workers at the peak of 
      their construction, and warned of further cost blowouts for Woodside 
      following tightening labour markets.  The main risks are obviously cost 
      overruns and delays,  Mr Bradley said.  Relatively closed isolated 
      Â­labour markets such as WA are particularly prone to both, as Woodside 
      has already discovered with Pluto-1 construction even in a much looser 
      market. 
      KEY POINTS The CFMEU has 
      withdrawn its notice by crane operators to strike at Pluto. Woodside says 
      its budget estimates are contingent on no further industrial action.

      EASTERN PERTH, Aug 12 AAP - 
      Eastern Star Gas Ltd says National Power 
      Group has taken over a power station project that was delayed after 
      investment bank Babcock & Brown's 
      collapse.
      Eastern Star operates the 
      Narrabri coal seam gas joint venture with Santos 
      Ltd in NSW. 
      It was to feed a new 
      gas-fuelled power station in the state's north under an agreement signed 
      in late 2007 with Babcock & Brown Australia Infrastructure Pty 
      Ltd.
      That agreement has been 
      assigned to National Power Group, which develops, finances, constructs and 
      operates power facilities in Australia including wind farms and power 
      stations fuelled by biomass and coal tailings.
       National Power's 
      involvement brings a refocused approach to the proposed power station 
      project which has, unfortunately, been delayed following the collapse of 
      Babcock & Brown,  Eastern Star 
      managing director David Casey said in a statement on Thursday.
      Babcock & Brown went into administration in

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"SANTOS has hired one of Australia's most senior liquefied natural gas sales executives in a boost to its management ranks.
It comes as the third-biggest oil and gas producer moves to sign up customers for the $16 billion Gladstone LNG project.
 The company has named former BP and North-West Shelf Australia executive Peter Cleary as vice-president of strategy and corporate development, reporting directly to chief executive David Knox.
Mr Cleary said he looked forward to joining Santos at a time its focus was heavily on finalising sales agreements with potential LNG buyers and moving towards a final investment decision for GLNG.
``I see it as a very good Australian company with a great deal of potential,'' he said.
The appointment comes at a critical time for Santos, which is aiming to approve GLNG by the end of the year, but must urgently find customers to underpin the two-train project.
For four years, Mr Cleary headed the marketing company for Australia's biggest operating LNG project, the North West Shelf in Western Australia, on secondment from BP.
The North West Shelf is owned by BP, Woodside Energy, Shell, BHP Billiton, Chevron and Japan's Mitsubishi and Mitsui.
Mr Cleary oversaw a series of gas supply contracts with Japanese customers as well as the first shipment of Australian LNG to China, in 2006.
Shares in Santos rose after Mr Cleary's appointment was announced, closing up 1.6 per cent at $13.85.
According to the Adelaide company, Mr Cleary will be responsible for its commercial, strategy and planning, corporate development, and public affairs.
Mr Cleary, 52, has held senior management positions in Australia, South Korea, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Britain.
The Australian reported last month that Shell had entered discussions about potentially merging their rival Queensland-based LNG projects.
Santos has announced also that vice-president for eastern Australia Mark Macfarlane would become chief executivein charge of the Gladstone venture's LNG plant and pipeline.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"EXPLORATORY drilling for natural gas is planned to begin 55 kilometres off Newcastle in October.
Drilling is expected to take 15 to 20 days, but gaining government approvals to extract gas will be at least four years away.
 Advent Energy holds the state's only offshore petroleum licence to explore an 8100 square kilometre area from Wollongong to Newcastle.
Gas reserves in the area are estimated at 13.2 trillion cubic feet.
It's a resource valued at $50 billion.
The company has contracted the rig Ocean Patriot to drill off Newcastle in October.
Advent executive director David Breeze said it would be the first time such drilling had occurred off the NSW coast.
Mr Breeze said reliance on cheap Hunter coal for energy had deterred drilling until now.
 Looking back 20 to 30 years ago, no one could have thought of competing with coal as a source of electricity,  Mr Breeze said.
 The state and federal governments are looking for gas as a source of electricity generation.
 Gas-fired power stations produce 60 per cent less carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired power stations. 
The gas could also have industrial and domestic uses, and the project could create 300 full-time and 2000 construction jobs.
Lake Macquarie City Council sustainability manager Quentin Espey will attend a community consultative meeting about the project on Tuesday.
Dr Espey, a trained oceanographer, said gas was considered a  temporary stepping stone from coal to renewables .
 Gas would be OK for the next 10 years, but not if it's going to have big impacts on coastal ecosystems and water quality,  Dr Espey said.
 Harvesting gas offshore is not a good idea; there's other ways to get the energy you need. 
Dr Espey said studies show Australia could be using renewable energy, such as solar thermal, wind power, hot rocks and photovoltaics, completely by the decade's end.
 It depends on political will,  he said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"CHEVRON PERTH, Aug 13 AAP - Chevron Corporation has made a new gas discovery in the Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia, where it is developing two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
The US energy giant said the Brederode-1 exploration well within its 50 per cent owned WA-364-P permit area had encountered about 15 metres or 49 feet of net gas pay.
 The permit, the remainder of which is held by Shell, is to the west of BHP Billiton Ltd's Thebe discovery and near Chevron's Kentish Knock discovery.
Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Co president Jim Blackwell said the Brederode-1 discovery, about 350km northwest of Onslow, extended the gas resources further offshore WA and boosted the company's discovered gas portfolio in Australia.
 This discovery expands the resource potential in the Carnarvon Basin frontier and demonstrates our long-term commitment to developing Australia's world-class natural gas resources,  Mr Blackwell said in a statement on Friday.
Chevron did not say whether the new discovery would feed its Gorgon or Wheatstone LNG projects.
Comment was being sought from Chevron.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"OIL Search, a partner in Exxon Mobil's $16.6 billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, expects to undergo ``a complete metamorphosis'' in the next five years after a review of expansion opportunities.
The company, aiming to increase reserves to support two more processing units at the gas venture, is advancing ``as expected'' with construction in PNG, managing director Peter Botten said yesterday.
 The partners initially plan two units capable of producing 6.6 million tonnes of LNG a year, with first exports scheduled in 2014.
``Delivery of PNG LNG is our No.1 priority,'' he said. ``We'll be a significant LNG producer in 2014 and hopefully have a series of other projects being progressed at that time.''
The Exxon-operated project will compete against planned LNG projects for Gladstone, also due to come on stream in the next few years.
Oil Search shares have dropped 4.7 per cent this year, against an 8.4 per cent drop for the ASX 200 index.
Its shares rose 7 to $5.84 yesterday.
Analysts at JPMorgan Chase say Exxon and its partners in the PNG venture may be considering ``bringing forward'' drilling at the country's Hides field so it can proceed with a third processing unit.
Mr Botten said Oil Search was ``looking at that''.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"US oil major Chevron has heaped further pressure on rival Woodside Petroleum after making another major gas discovery in its Carnarvon Basin drilling program, adding to strong reserve numbers to fuel its huge Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied natural gas projects.
Brederode 1, located in the Exmouth Plateau, is the third gas find reported by the US company off Western Australia since the start of July.
 The well, located within the WA-364-P permit approximately 350 kilometres north-west of Onslow, follows the Kentish Knock discovery in the same plateau in 2009.
Chevron's Australian subsidiary is the operator of the WA-364-P permit, while the Australian unit of Royal Dutch Shell owns the remaining 50 per cent.
Gorgon is due to start LNG deliveries in 2014, and Wheatstone in 2016.
The latest find will place more pressure on Woodside, ahead of its upcoming first-half results on Wednesday, to agree to a gas supply deal with US independent Hess for its Pluto LNG expansion project.
While Woodside has achieved some success in its record drilling program under way in the Carnarvon Basin, it needs more gas supplies from third parties to meet its target of approving an expansion to its $13â€Šbillion Pluto project at the end of the year.
Hess has been in talks with Woodside for months about gas from their jointly owned fields and from a separate cluster of discoveries held solely by the New York-based firm.
Deutsche Bank also believes a favourable deal could be struck by Woodside for gas from the Scarborough field, held jointly by BHP and ExxonMobil, to fuel Pluto 2.
Woodside has yet to reveal who it is in talks with, but a Scarborough deal would solve its gas supply woes for the Pluto expansion and help close the widening gap on Chevron.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"PNG By Ilya Gridneff
HONIARA, Aug 16 AAP - Angry landowners have gone on strike and stopped construction work on Papua New Guinea's massive Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project.
 Work has stopped at the ExxonMobil-led LNG project's Kobalu base in Tari, Southern Highlands Province, after more than 100 locals walked off the job.
PNG's National newspaper reported workers hired by international contractor Red Seas Housing Services were complaining of poor working condition and unfair treatment.
Kobalu landowner leader Andrew Pulupe shut the base's gates at 3.30pm local time on Sunday and ordered Red Seas expatriate staff to vacate the premises.
The workers were building a storage facility and living quarters for up to 200 employees.
Mr Pulupe said the stop-work order would continue until the government and ExxonMobil addressed the landowners' demands.
Kobalu landowners want the government's promised business development grants and want ministerial commitments honoured regarding benefit sharing agreements for the LNG project.
A PNG government spokesman told AAP the matter should be resolved this week and would not cause any major delays to the LNG project.
 Most of the dispute is around the government's promise to provide 120 million kina ($A30 million) in seed capital to help the landowner companies undertake contracts with the PNG LNG Project,  he said.
 These have not been satisfactorily handled to date and have come to a head.
 We were close to resolution but the landowners have got impatient with the process.
 Discussions and negotiations in the next few days are likely to resolve the issues.
 It will not be difficult to settle the outstanding issues and it is not anticipated that undue delays will occur in the construction schedule,  he said.
Continual landowner disputes and security concerns could hamper the project, which is expected to double PNG's GDP with 30 years of gas sales to Asia.
The PNG government is in talks with the Australian government to help establish a sovereign wealth fund that would funnel LNG revenue into much-needed development infrastructure.
Energy giant ExxonMobil has a 33.2 per cent stake in the project and operates it via its subsidiary Esso Highlands Ltd, while Oil Search Ltd has a 29 per cent stake in the project and the PNG government owns 16.6 per cent.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"The NSW coal seam gas sector is ready to step out of the shadow of its northern neighbours, writes Mathew Murphy.
DAVID Casey says the New South wales coal seam gas sector has long been regarded as the  poor cousin  of its northern neighbours. While it is a fair and frank assessment by the Eastern Star Gas managing director, it is interesting to note that it was NSW that is viewed as the birth place of the unconventional gas in Australia.
 In the 1980s BHP tried to extract gas from its coalfields at Appin near Wollongong. The big Australian installed some gas turbines there, but its efforts floundered when it discovered carbon dioxide seeping into the gas stream. From there most of the hard yards were carried out in Queensland's Bowen Basin. Twenty years on and the Queensland coal seam gas sector is a $50 billion market darling, attracting interest from international oil and gas giants like BG, ConocoPhillips and Shell.
But what happened along the way to NSW?
Some blame a lack of government support, others point to the immaturity of the resources industry in NSW at the time and the different techniques needed to extract the gas.
Mr Casey says the NSW sector is overcoming historical impediments and forging its own path. He believes Eastern Star could be converting coal seam gas into liquefied natural gas for exporting out of Newcastle by 2014 â€” the same time as its more fancied rivals in Queensland.
 The poor cousin analogy will change and it will change a lot quicker than most analysts predict,  he says.  It will be led by projects progressing and in Eastern Star's case going to front-end engineering and design at Newcastle and reaching a final investment decision on the ERM power station at Wellington.
 I think once we start to see projects moving forward you will get some traction and over the next six to 12 months I think you will see that happen. 
Coal seam gas, or coal seam methane, occurs naturally within coal deposits, with almost all the Australian industry in Queensland or NSW.
The gas is largely composed of methane, which is also the principal component of natural gas. Coal seam gas generally has very little carbon dioxide content, compared to many natural gas deposits, and is therefore considered a more greenhouse gas-friendly energy source. However, coal seam gas has had its critics over the years with many deeming it uneconomic due to its low calorific value, or the amount of heat released during combustion.
A look at coal seam gas reserves in Australia shows the head start NSW has given Queensland. The May EnergyQuarterly by consultants Energy Quest rates Queensland's proved, probable and possible reserves (3P) at 47,383 petajoules, or about 89 per cent of the Australian coal seam gas industry. NSW has about 11 per cent of the market, or 5836 petajoules. Even accounting for Queensland's 22,634 petajoules of contingent supply and NSW's comparative 4692 petajoules, the gap is only slightly bridged.
While the Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland house the richest coal seam gas prospects in the state, in NSW it is split among four; the Gunnedah Basin in central NSW, the Gloucester Basin near Newcastle, the Clarence-Moreton Basin in the north-east corner of NSW and the Sydney Basin located around the NSW capital.
Graeme Bethune, chief executive of independent adviser Energy Quest, says unlike the crowded Queensland market where the four major proponents will reside in the Gladstone postcode, the NSW players have some breathing space between each other.
 AGL is in the Sydney and Gloucester basins, there is the Gunnedah Basin where Eastern Star and Santos are and Metgasco is in the Clarence-Moreton,  he says.  The NSW producers would say they are a fair way behind Queensland producers in terms of development and understanding.
 In fact, there is basically no production in NSW except by AGL at Camden. There have been some encouraging well flows but none have been able to get into commercial production and they have been working on it for some time. 
Mr Casey believes Eastern Star is  a good 2Â½ years ahead  of other rivals in NSW.
 Camden is the most mature coal seam gas field in NSW. It is the most mature coal seam gas field in NSW but it is limited in size and scope â€” I don't think even AGL would dispute that. AGL would be more focused on their Hunter Valley assets and for them to get to where we are up there they have a lot of work to do,  he said.  We are genuine in our pursuit of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) hub at Newcastle.
 We have the resource base and soon we will have reserves that will underpin major infrastructure development. The time differential compared to Queensland is not as different as everyone thinks. It is not an insignificant task, but we believe we could be delivering LNG out of Newcastle by 2014, which is the same time as Queensland. 
At that point, Eastern Star is looking to start exporting a million tonnes of LNG a year, increasing to 4 million tonnes a year. By then it is expecting to have also started supplying 20 petajoules over 20 years to the ERM Power generator at Wellington, NSW.
Mr Casey said the Queensland coal seam gas experience had highlighted the need to educate the community and government about the emerging technology.
 It is a function of education and making sure that the community is aware of what you are doing and they understand what you are doing,  he said.  In our case our coal seam is quite deep at 1000 metres. One of the benefits is that they are isolated in a way that there is no way that we can contaminate local or regional aquifers. 
David Johnson, managing director of Metgasco, says the NSW government needs to develop a more clearly defined gas policy to emulate the success in Queensland and progress the local industry.
 In Queensland they have been producing oil and gas for years so they have a process for ensuring that there is a sensible commercial timetable for the development of projects,  he said.  In NSW they are struggling to develop a coherent regulatory environment for the development of gas resources. 
Metgasco has been reported as saying it is considering exporting up to 3 million tonnes of LNG a year out of Queensland. But Mr Johnson says the domestic gas sector will be accommodated initially.
 Our first and most immediate objective is to supply gas into the northern rivers area of northern NSW. It is an area that currently has no gas supply and is in a very energy constrained environment.  he said.
 We see that there is a possibility to connect to Queensland markets and we see that we have a role in the broader market in exports by being tapped into the infrastructure in Queensland. 
While Santos has purchased a 19 per cent stake in Eastern Star, and has been rumoured to be considering a full takeover of the company to shore up its own gas supplies, there is not the same flurry of excitement around potential consolidation in the NSW coal seam gas sector.
 At this stage there is no driving need for consolidation per se,  Mr Johnson said.  But who knows where we will be a bit further down the track.

 more successful interstate neighbours. Report, page 7.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"All the indications are that Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte will formally admit defeat this Wednesday in the firm's Â­efforts to make a final investment Â­decision (FID) on its Pluto liquefied natural gas plant expansion this year.
Woodside is due to hand down its first-half earnings on Wednesday, with Macquarie tipping an 85 per cent jump in underlying earnings to $US722 million ($809 million). While that sort of earnings growth â€“ in this instance predicated on a 53 per cent rally in oil prices â€“ looks impressive, much of the scrutiny on the day will Â­be on guidance and discussion of Woodside's LNG growth projects.
 The addition of a second train, or processing line, at Pluto represents a hugely value-accretive development for Woodside, yet it is one for which the facts have to date worked against.
Woodside is putting the finishing touches to the $13 billion first train at Pluto, in north-western Western Australia. A second train would be able to leverage off much of the infrastructure already built to support train one, offering Woodside economies of scale and a far more Â­robust overall project.
Voelte's plan has always been to roll over the workforce from train one to train two as soon as the former was complete. That has meant Â­being able to present a business plan for train two to the company's board by the end of this year. But, according to brokers, there seems to be little chance of that happening before 2010 is out. Analysts have been queuing up to tip that Woodside won't be sanctioning the expansion this year, with Wednesday's results strongly tipped as the time for Woodside to confirm that.
In fact, a deferral of the train two FID has been on the cards since Voelte first set the ambitious timeÂ­table, with the main concern Â­always whether Woodside could identify the reserves needed to support the development.
Woodside has been up against it since then, fast-tracking an unprecedented 20-well exploration program aimed at finding the required Â­reserves that has so far met with mixed success.
At the same time, Woodside has been in intense negotiations with third-party holders of gas reserves nearby. While Woodside has been delicately trying to strike a good deal, the region's LNG upstart, United States energy giant Chevron, has been trying to sign up third-party partners for its own Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG Â­developments in the region.
And it has been in so far fruitless discussions with potential long-term customers for the expanded project in what is firmly a buyers' market.
The fact Voelte is considered likely to push the decision on train two into 2011 this Wednesday is a reflection that Woodside's campaigns have not fared as well as originally hoped.
While the exploration produced three discoveries, all three wells drilled in the June quarter were dry.
The progress of third-party gas talks has been even more limited.
The Julimar-Brunello gas discoveries of Apache Energy and Kufpec had been prime candidates for a deal with Woodside, but the pair opted to take Chevron's generous terms and partner with the major at Wheatstone.
Woodside's most obvious third- party partner, US company Hess, has indicated it will reach a Â­decision on a home for its sizeable West Australian gas reserves in its own time. While Woodside had been aiming for a final decision by the end of 2010, Hess said Â­recently it would decide on commercialisation options for its gas only by 2011. The Hess gas is a vital piece of the LNG puzzle in Western Australia. Hess owns 100 per cent of the red hot exploration lease WA-390-P, where an impressive 11 out of 14 wells so far have been discoveries. While Hess hasn't released any numbers on the lease's reserves, it is likely to run into several trillion cubic feet, enough to easily justify the addition of extra trains to an LNG project like Pluto.
Hess is also a 50 per cent partner in the Woodside-operated block WA-404-P, where Woodside has recently made its Noblige and Martell discoveries, but is yet to agree to any deal with Woodside over where its share of the lease's gas will wind up.
Ominously for Voelte, Hess did its best to sound aloof about Woodside when it discussed development Â­options for its West Australian gas.
At its recent results, the company said it was in talks not just with Woodside but also with Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. The mention of Chevron was to be expected, but Shell was something of a surprise. Shell is a Â­minority partner in both the North West Shelf LNG project and Chevron's under-construction Gorgon, but does not have its own Â­operated LNG project in the region on the cards.
It is, however, building a number of revolutionary floating LNG vessels, which will in theory be able to convert into LNG gas those reserves previously too small and/or too remote to support land-based LNG facilities.
The increased competition from other LNG developers means Woodside will be forced into offering more generous terms to Hess than it may have originally envisaged.
Of course, Voelte may yet have a couple of tricks up his sleeve. His faith in Woodside's ability to find the gas it needs off its own bat has so far been unshakeable, and he has previously promised any Â­delay on the Pluto-2 FID would not be for a lack of gas.
Right now, Woodside is in the final stages of drilling two wells off the WA coast which could end the gas supply questions. There is a strong chance that Voelte and his team will know by Wednesday if the two wells have been successful.
Larsen Deep, a 50-50 joint venture with Hess, is a comparatively low-risk well and one that is believed to be a Â­relatively small target. But Alaric could really be a game-changer. Woodside owns the prospect 100 per cent, and it sits in a region historically punctuated by larger gas discoveries. A big find there, and the months of angst for Woodside and its shareholders about the gas issue could be over.
For now, however, Pluto-2 remains clouded by short-term uncertainty.
For the longer term, how much does a delay to the FID matter? Given Pluto will ultimately be producing LNG for decades, is quibbling over a few months here and there a waste of time?
Even though Pluto-2 may not get sanctioned as quickly as first hoped, doesn't the fact remain that Pluto has been developed at a hare-like pace in the world of LNG? It is, after all, just over five years since the original Pluto gas discovery was made. Chevron's Gorgon, by comparison, was first found in the 1970s.
That is all true, but the Â­uncertainty over Pluto-2 has been enough to shake the confidence of analysts.
Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood initiated coverage of Woodside in late June with a sell recommendation, Â­primarily predicated on his concern over the Pluto expansion and Woodside's other LNG growth projects, Browse and Sunrise.
Browse is a monster $38 billion project slated for development in northern WA, if it can overcome technical issues and disharmony among its partners, while Woodside's development plans for Sunrise, in the Timor Sea, are being disputed by the East Timor government.
Greenwood said at the time he could not see how Woodside could approve Pluto-2 this year.  We see timing and valuation risks associated with Woodside's portfolio growth options, Pluto-2, Browse and Sunrise,  he said.
 Browse is long dated and has technical risks to overcome. Sunrise appears stalled Â­because of the entrenched position of East Timor. Pluto-2 timing is uncertain until a gas source can be defined. The current share price already attributes 75 per cent of the value in these three growth projects despite these risks. 
Since then, Woodside shares have fallen from $44.56 to as low as $40.65 last week.
The angst over Pluto isn't confined to the expansion option. There are worries over whether the budget and schedule for Pluto's first train will hold, given the bouts of Â­industrial Â­action since a budget blowout of 6 to 10 per cent was Â­announced last year.
 In light of the issues faced on site so far this year, we believe meeting the current schedule guidance could prove challenging,  said Macquarie's Adrian Wood.
Concerns over Pluto and Woodside's broader development pipeline are not confined to analysts. The market has been marking the company down against its peers in the past three months â€“ underperforming Santos by 15 per cent, Oil Search by 11 per cent and the market generally by 4 per cent. The stock is now at its lowest levels since July last year, despite oil prices being 25 per cent higher.
Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Â­Jason Mabee believes the market's concerns are overdone. He says he is  a little concerned  about Pluto, but he doesn't believe there can be any more downside to the stock.
 We would argue management still has some work ahead in order to reach FID by early 2011, but we expect the company to be bullish at the upcoming result about what it has found so far,  Mabee says.  In our view, this should help to facilitate a bounce-back in the share price. 
Woodside under Voelte has been brave and bold, generating strong share price growth over the course of time and putting it on the cusp of transformational earnings growth from Pluto. The downside of such bold plans is the market pain that can come when such schedules are missed.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Struggling utilities group Alinta Energy will take an impairment charge of about $465 million in its second-half earnings, mostly on the write-down of its retailing arm in Western Australia, which has been hit by a jump in natural gas costs.
About $350 million of the charge relates to Alinta Retail, with the rest linked with Alinta's power generation businesses in Queensland and south-west Western Australia, where electricity prices have been lower than forecast, requiring a reassessment of carrying values, Alinta said yesterday.
 Although the charge will lift gearing, Alinta said it remained in compliance with all its financial covenants.
The utility was given approval from its banking syndicate in June to modify the conditions of its loans.
The charge comes as several strategies are being considered to try to put the ailing business, which is weighed down by $2.7 billion of debt, back on a stronger financial footing.
The planned restructuring of the business, which has an equity value of less than $50 million, is expected to be one of the most complicated in Australian corporate history.
Hedge funds that have bought Alinta's debt are pushing for a debt-for-equity swap that would effectively wipe out existing equity holders.
Meanwhile, bids on the company's assets, which include interests in 12 operating power generators mostly in Western Australia and South Australia, are due on August 31.
The retail business has almost 600,000 business and household gas customers and about 1400 electricity customers.
Up to five bidders are believed to be eyeing Alinta, including several consortiums that are considering buying all of the company's assets, rather than piecemeal acquisitions.
A group comprising Origin Energy, pipeline owner APA Group and Japan's Marubeni Corp is believed to be among the bidders, while BHP Billiton, Sumitomo and Saudi Arabia's Acwa Power International are also thought to be interested.
Macquarie Capital Advisers and UBS are managing the debt reduction process for Alinta, while Lazard is advising the company's board on assessing the proposals.
Alinta, formerly Babcock & Brown Power, said yesterday it expects a transaction will be selected and announced by the end of September.
The utility, Australia's biggest listed power-generation business, reached an agreement in December with the Woodside Petroleum-led North-West Shelf venture, which had been seeking to more than double the price of the gas it sells to the utility. The accord, which was essential to getting Alinta's lenders to roll over debt, left the utility facing increased gas prices as well as back payments.
Alinta is due to report its full-year results mid-next week.

Woodside previously said a decision on the expansion of Pluto to a two processing 'train' operation would be made in late 2010.
 Shares in Woodside gained one per cent after the Perth-based company posted a net profit of $US901 million ($A995 million) for the six months to June 30, up 39.5 per cent from $US646 million ($A714 million) a year earlier.
The result was boosted by a gain on the sale of its Otway assets in Victoria.
The profit result was well above analysts' expectations of $US775 million ($A855.98 million).
 They well and truly beat consensus,  IG Markets analyst Cameron Peacock said.
 There were some asset sales in there which helped that along a little bit, but it was a really positive result. 
Shares in Woodside gained 44 cents, or 1.02 per cent, to $43.49 by 1233 AEST, the highest since June 24.
Revenue rose 45.4 per cent to $US2.102 billion ($A2.32 billion), due largely to stronger commodity prices.
Woodside described production as  solid  despite an 8.5 per cent drop in output to 36.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), due to the Otway sale and natural oil field decline.
The company maintained its full year production target of 70 to 75MMboe.
It said natural decline across its portfolio of producing oil fields would be offset by stronger production from the North West Shelf, off Western Australia.
Gavin Wendt, senior resources analyst at research house Mine Life Pty Ltd, said it was unsurprising Woodside was running behind schedule with the Pluto expansion after industrial action at the stage one project earlier this year.
Coupled with the industrial action was the company's ongoing efforts to secure enough gas to underpin a second train, Mr Wendt said.
Mr Wendt said two gas discoveries announced by Woodside since Friday gave the market confidence that a second Pluto train may not be far away.
 There might be some slippage in terms of time but it won't be significant,  he said.
Stock Resource managing director Grant Craighead said Woodside was rushing to beat rival Chevron in getting LNG to market as quickly as possible.
Mr Wendt said recent exploration success by Chevron in WA - including one of its most significant gas finds in Australia - had overshadowed Woodside's exploration efforts.
 Exploration is ongoing so I expect they (Woodside) will find more gas,  he said.
Woodside said it was still considering buying gas from third parties to underpin the second Pluto train.
 Final investment decision for Pluto expansion trains remains contingent on securing sufficient volumes of economically viable gas resources, either through exploration and/or other resource owners,  Woodside said in a statement.
Woodside declared an interim dividend of 50 cents fully franked, up from 46 cents in the prior corresponding period.

PERTH, Aug 18 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd has eclipsed expectations with a jump in first half profit but delayed a final investment decision for its $8 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansion until 2011.
 The oil and gas producer previously said a decision would be made by late 2010 on the expansion of the Pluto project to a two processing `train' operation.
Chief executive Don Voelte said the company had put back its target date for a final investment decision (FID) to proceed with the second Pluto train to 2011 so that it could conclude discussions to buy gas from other energy firms.
The gas is needed to underpin the second Pluto train at Karratha, Western Australia, although Woodside has since Friday announced two gas discoveries that will be fed into the project.
 We're continuing discussions with various parties to send large volumes of gas to Pluto for processing,  Mr Voelte told a briefing.
The company on Wednesday posted a net profit of $US901 million ($A995.14 million) for the six months to June 30, up 39.5 per cent from $US646 million ($A713.5 million) a year earlier.
Shares in Woodside gained 25 cents to $43.30 after reaching a high of $43.80 in intraday trade.
The profit result was boosted by a gain on the sale of its Otway assets in Victoria and was well above analysts' expectations of $US775 million ($A855.98 million).
Mr Voelte said the Pluto site could accommodate a further four LNG trains in addition to its foundation train.
 This has given us the options to consider both equity gas development and ORO (other resource owners) gas supply,  he said.
 In fact, our ORO options are at a point of deliberations where we've actually reserved two LNG train footprints for the remainder of the discussions that we're having that hopefully will reach a conclusion by the end of this year. 
He said the company originally wanted to progress swiftly to FID to avoid  a head to head  battle with Chevron amid fears the US energy giant could cause a shortage of construction workers while it develops its massive Gorgon LNG project in WA.
Mine Life Pty Ltd senior resources analyst Gavin Wendt said it was unsurprising Woodside was running behind schedule with the Pluto expansion after industrial action earlier this year.
Mr Wendt said recent gas discoveries gave the market confidence that a second Pluto train may not be far away.

Mr Voelte said the Sunrise Commission, a joint East Timor-Australia regulatory body set up to oversee the stalled Woodside-led Sunrise LNG project in the Timor Sea, would meet after the Australian federal election.
He said he expected  a lot of movement over the next month or two  on the Browse LNG project in WA, which has been held up by disputes between indigenous groups but is slated for FID in mid-2012.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"CHEVRON and its arch competitor in liquefied natural gas, Woodside, have both made gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin off Western Australia.
Both companies are out to persuade would-be LNG buyers that their proposed LNG developments â€” Wheatstone for Chevron and the Pluto 2 expansion for Woodside â€” have the necessary gas bank behind them.
 The US-based Chevron has taken the lead.
Yesterday's announcement that its Acme 1 exploration well in the WA-205 permit was one of its biggest discoveries in the region did not hurt. The well is 150 kilometres from the proposed Wheatstone site, at Onslow.
Acme 1 encountered 273 metres of (net) gas pay. It was Chevron's ninth and biggest gas find in WA waters in the past year.
Chevron, the lead partner in the Gorgon LNG project, expected the discovery to help underpin  potential expansion opportunities at the Wheatstone LNG gas hub .
Chevron owns 67 per cent of the lease while Woodside's biggest shareholder, Shell, holds the remainder.
Woodside said its Larsen Deep 1 well in permit WA-404-P had intersected a less impressive 50 metres (gross) of gas in several zones. It did not report the net pay zone. The benefit for Woodside is that Larsen Deep 1 is within nine kilometres of its  central hub  discoveries at Martell 1, Noblige 1 and Larsen 1. Woodside owns 50 per cent and US group Hess the remainder.
Earlier this week Woodside reported the Alaric 1 deepwater gas discovery (185 metres gross over several zones).
The discovery will need to shape up as a development candidate given it is about 500 kilometres offshore.
Woodside is now under pressure to reconfirm that it will have a gas base that will allow it to make a final investment decision on the Pluto 2 expansion by the end of the year.
The company will inform the market of its plans at the release of its June-half profit report today.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,3,"Election promise will allow tax breaks to mum and dad Metgasco investors
THE company behind a coal seam gas project tipped to transform Casino has spoken out in praise of a Coalition policy it says will allow local mum and dad investors to claim company expenses on their personal tax.
 Metgasco chief financial officer Glenda McLoughlin said the Coalition policy would make the small company more attractive to investors, while Labor's mining policy would make it less att-ractive, particularly compared to similar projectsbeing run by big Queensland companies.
Ms McLoughlin said the Coalition policy would allow Metgasco to pass on tax write-offs to investors, providing an incentive for them to continue investing, even though the company was not yet generating revenue.
However, concessions from Labor on its mining tax, which the Coalition wants to scrap, would have the opposite effect â€“ locally at least. Ms McLoughlin said the mining tax would be bad for Metgasco generally, saying it applied to any profits the company generated â€“ not just any â€˜super' profits it might make in the future.
What was even worse though was Labor's decision to allow mining companies to mark up their assets to market value, effectively providing big tax breaks to big companies, such as Metgasco's competitors in Queensland, that had a lot of assets. That would make it harder for Metgasco to attract investors, because the tax breaks received by the Queensland companies would mean they could offer higher returns on investment dollars.
Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson, who was visiting Lismore yesterday, said Metgasco would have been better off if Labor had been able to pass its emissions trading scheme, which would have created a market advantage for companies creating clean energy.
Mr Ferguson said Labor was committed to a â€˜level playing field' for companies and suggested Metgasco prepare a submission for the Government's Argus-Ferguson Committee, which is looking at issues around the tax.
However, Ms McLoughlin said Metgasco's experiences in dealing with the Government had so far been less than promising and attempts to speak with the Government at the ministerial level had failed. The Prime Minister's office and NSW Premier's office had both failed to respond to letters sent to them by Metgasco in May.
Page Nationals candidate Kevin Hogan said it was important to support companies like Metgasco. â€œMetgasco is good for infrastructure in the area and it's a clean energy project as well,â€? he said.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"POLL10 CANBERRA, Aug 19 AAP - Prime Minister Julia Gillard says she won't promise Australian backing for a lucrative gas plant to sway East Timor into agreeing to host a regional centre to process asylum seekers.
Woodside Petroleum is planning to process natural gas from the Sunrise gas field on a purpose-built floating platform in the Timor Sea.
 The government of East Timor is keen to have a processing plant located on its territory onshore.
Ms Gillard said such commercial decisions should be made in the best interest of shareholders.
The prime minister confirmed a re-elected Labor government would pursue a dialogue with East Timor about the processing centre.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"ARROW MELBOURNE, Aug 19 AAP - A ceremony in Queensland has marked the takeover of coal seam gas company Arrow Energy Ltd by international oil giant Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina Co Ltd.
Premier Anna Bligh said the $3.5 billion takeover of Arrow brought together Shell's knowledge in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and China's energy market.
 Ms Bligh said the deal would see the company owned by Shell and Petrochina, CS CSG (Australia) Pty Ltd, accelerate delivery of the proposed Curtis Island LNG facility, which could process up to 16 million tonnes of LNG per year.
 This project alone would require a workforce of up to 3,000 people... at the peak of construction with approximately 200 to 300 permanent jobs needed for ongoing operations,  Ms Bligh said in a statement.
She said her government was committed to developing the LNG industry, subject to strict environmental regulations.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"WOODSIDE Petroleum has outdone market expectations to produce a better than expected underlying profit, up 26 per cent on a year ago.
However, despite the strong first-half result, the oil and gas major confirmed market fears that a final investment decision on its Pluto liquefied natural gas expansion would slide into 2011.
 Woodside boss Don Voelte reaffirmed costs for the $13 billion first stage of Pluto, which is now 92 per cent complete, but said the company would need to prove up more gas before reaching a final investment decision on Pluto trains 2 and 3.
 Final investment decision on Pluto expansion trains remains contingent on identification of economically viable gas resources, either through exploration volumes and, or, other resource owners,  a Woodside statement said.  Work will continue into 2011 to achieve the investment case for Pluto expansion. 
The announcement was widely expected despite Woodside reporting a significant gas discovery this week from its Alaric 1 well. That discovery is being assessed, but some analysts believe the find  may support a stand-alone expansion of Pluto .
Mr Voelte said Woodside remained in talks with  various parties  to supply  large volumes of gas to Pluto for processing . He said any schedule slippage for Pluto would not be significant and that Chevron's $43 billion Gorgon LNG project had not progressed as quickly as Woodside expected, which gave the company more time to decide on advancing Pluto.
Woodside's underlying net profit rose from $US646 million in the first half of 2009 to $US813 million ($A900 million) a year later, due largely to stronger commodity prices and the $US712.5 million sale of its Victorian Otway assets.
After-tax profit hit $US901 million, up 40 per cent from the $US646 million recorded the same time last year. Woodside retained its production target for 2010 of 70-75 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Shareholders will receive a fully franked interim dividend of US50Â¢ a share, up from US46Â¢ a year ago, to be paid on September 23 for all shareholders registered by August 27.
Mr Voelte said Woodside would continue to talk to the Australian and East Timorese governments on its Sunrise floating LNG proposal. He said the $30 billion Browse LNG project in Western Australia's Kimberley region was on track for a final investment decision by mid-2012.
Royal Bank of Scotland said it believed the delay on a final investment decision for the Pluto expansion was to be expected.  [There is] lots of work ahead in getting Pluto 2 to the finish line, but the next six to nine months have some good catalysts ahead as Pluto 1 starts to contribute.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"MINING TAX
GREENS leader Bob Brown has demanded a $2 billion increase to the mining tax to boost public schools and promised to fight to introduce a carbon price and block the expansion of the coal-seam gas industry on prime agricultural land.
 With the Greens expected to gain enough seats to hold the balance of power in the Senate after Saturday's election, Senator Brown indicated he would oppose Tony Abbott's bid to wind back the Building the Education Revolution program, saying the Greens would roll out the remainder of the $16 billion package.
But a spokeswoman for Senator Brown last night declined to say whether the $2bn in extra revenue from the mining tax would be gained by lifting the threshold or increasing its application.
The matter was one ``for negotiation'', she said.
In an address to the National Press Club in Canberra yesterday, Senator Brown signalled he would fight the expansion of the coal-seam gas industry, particularly in food production areas such as the Darling Downs in Queensland, back light rail and establish a parliamentary budget office to provide economic and budgetary advice to parliament.
He warned that Labor could not control the Senate and the choice was between a Greens balance of power or Coalition domination.
Senator Brown said he would push for a referendum on the republic, recognition of gay marriage and recognition in the Constitution of indigenous people and local government. The Greens would not vote to block supply and would use their balance of power ``responsibly''.
Senator Brown said he supported the original 40 per cent resource super-profits tax but would opt for Labor's reduced tax rather than the Coalition's plan to scrap it.
But he said the Greens would push for the Gillard government's proposal, forecast to raise $10.5bn in its first two years, to be increased by $2bn to fund a raft of educational initiatives.
``We are dedicated educationalists; we know that the nation's future depends on the education dollar and quality of teaching,'' Senator Brown said.
``I make no apology for this; we will negotiate hard . . . to get a massive injection of funds. I've talked about $2bn here into the schools system and to get a better outcome for the tertiary system and the TAFE colleges as well.''
Senator Brown promised $600 million over four years to support teachers early in their career, when they were at high risk of leaving the profession.
A further $150m would be spent on grants of $70,000 to schools to employ an extra teacher to reduce the workloads of first-year and mentor teachers.
The package included $320m over four years for a commonwealth teaching scholarship to provide 3000 places worth $5000 a year for up to five years. The scholarship recipients would be required to work in public schools with high needs for three years.
More money would be spent on addressing the shortage of maths and science teachers, and on universities and the TAFE community would get increased funding.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Phil Mathews has made a motza on exploiting Australia's natural resources.
First it was picking the winner in the rush for coal seam gas with Arrow Energy and now it seems he's turned his attention to Australian agribusiness.
 Not only is his Mathews Capital Partners the single largest shareholder in beleaguered timber giant Gunns but Street Talk understands Mathews is behind Bank of America's creep up the Elders' register.
After emerging as a substantial shareholder on July 23 with a 5 per cent stake, the bank continued to buy stock and by last Friday had notched up a 7.2Â per cent share. This makes Mathews Capital Elders' second-biggest shareholder. With its share price trading at decade lows, BHP Billiton's bid for Potash, and Agrium busting AWE and GrainCorp's nil-premium merger hopes apart, Elders is clearly vulnerable to an offshore group looking to expand locally. And cheap to boot if you consider AWB's net tangible assets (NTA) per share is $1.04 versus a bid price of $1.50, while Elders NTA is about $1.60 compared with a current share price of 62Â¢. Moreover, putting Elders' Rural Services on a similar multiple to Agrium's bid for AWB, which owns Landmark, spits out a value of almost $700 million.
Elders is plagued with problems and chief executive Malcolm Jackman is taking his time in executing the promised asset sales process. The automotive division is the prize. But Elders reckons potential purchasers are unlikely to pay the right price until Ford makes a final determination about manufacturing in Australia for the long term.

Chief executive Don Voelte has turned a slippage in Woodside Petroleum's Â­development schedule into an attack on its liquefied natural gas Â­rival Â­Chevron, claiming a lack of progress at the Chevron-operated Gorgon LNG project has eased the pressure on Woodside to stick to its timetable.
 Woodside used its half-year result yesterday to confirm that a final Â­investment decision on a second train, or processing line, at its Pluto LNG project in Western Australia would now not be made this year.
The delay had been tipped after mixed success in Woodside's efforts to discover more gas to support the Â­expansion and the slow progress of Â­negotiations with third-party gas owners in the region.
Mr Voelte said the impetus to Â­approve a second train at Pluto had eased due to the slow progress of Â­construction at the $43 billion Gorgon project, sanctioned by Chevron and its partners last year.
The alleged slow start at Gorgon meant Woodside would not face the same competition for labour and equipment during the construction of Pluto-2 as originally modelled.
 We would have anticipated a bit of a different construction schedule if we were building Gorgon,  Mr Voelte said.  We're actually going to have not just a little bit more time, but quite a bit of time as we're building brownfields against where Gorgon's at. 
Mr Voelte said Woodside knew a lot about the progress of Gorgon from its contractor contacts.
 Gorgon's building the village to build the village out there at this point,  he said.
A spokesman for Chevron denied any slip in Gorgon's timetable, saying it remained on schedule for first gas in 2014.
Mr Voelte's comments came as Woodside announced a better than Â­expected first-half profit of $US901 million ($997 million), up 40 per cent from a year ago thanks to higher oil prices and the proceeds from the sale of its Otway gas project.
Analysts had tipped a $US866 million net profit.
Woodside will also pay an interim dividend of US50Â¢ fully franked, up from US46Â¢ a year ago.
The delayed timetable for Pluto's second train, combined with two recent gas discoveries, will give Woodside more leverage in talks with potential third-party gas owners.
Woodside said it had earmarked two other Pluto train sites for third parties, with the construction and Â­operation of the trains on behalf of other parties potentially a way of securing  very significant value .â€Š.â€Š. for virtually no capital investment .
Mr Voelte said that although the late arrival of a drill rig had set back the Â­exploration program, Woodside was on track to define enough reserves to feed into Pluto's second train.
 Expansion of at least one further train is comfortably within the range of outcomes and we just need to continue to drill and appraise to reduce any uncertainties,  Mr Voelte said.
Woodside also announced yesterday that it would write down the value of its 20 per cent stake in the Neptune oil field in the Gulf of Mexico by $US92 million following the moratorium on drilling in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said the Pluto-2 delay was expected and would not undo the company's infrastructure advantage in the region.
 It's nice to make all these discoveries, and there's a hell of a lot of gas off Western Australia, but the infrastructure is equally important and people tend to forget that,  he said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"A group of farmers from the far west say coal seam gas explorations in the region are not worth the damage they could cause to local aquifers.
A meeting has been held at Agquip in Gunnedah to discuss surveying by gas exploration company Santos, which is being carried out as part of preparations for a proposed gas pipe.
 The plan affects land at Tooraweenah, Coonamble, Walgett and in the Warrumbungle Shire.
Tooraweenah farmer Heath Webb says loopholes in current legislation need to be addressed.
 It's different to oil, it's different to other minerals and it hasn't been updated in terms of water use and water as a by-product and all these kinds of environmental issues that we're seeing from the coal seam gas,  he said.
 This coal seam gas thing is a step ahead of the legislation. You could honestly say the Government's probably asleep on the issue. 
Mr Webb says the legal implications for both personal safety and environmental protection need to be defined before any exploration begins.
The New South Wales Farmers' Association says lessons can be learnt from legal issues concerning coal seam gas investigations in the United States and Queensland, with measures later taken to protect landowners and the environment.
A Santos spokesman says the company adheres to strict industry regulations in its explorations.
He says Santos agrees that legislation does need to be updated to reflect modern drilling practices.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE dramatic emergence of a new coal-seam gas industry in Queensland offers big economic benefits, but is raising concerns with some people about protecting arable land and the environment.
The CSG industry is neither new, nor unregulated. Natural gas has been part of the state's energy landscape for more than a century and the extraction of gas from coal seams has been conducted without incident for about 15 years.
 The Australian Government estimates Queensland has sufficient gas to power the state for at least 1000 years. If you have natural gas connected to your home, chances are you'll be using CSG to boil your next pot of tea as it already accounts for about 80 per cent of Queensland's gas supply. The days of being a new technology are far behind the CSG industry.
Yet what is new is the prospect of Queensland being home to the world's first liquefied natural gas industry using CSG as feedstock.
The enormous growth in global energy demand is driving multibillion-dollar investments in the export of our CSG, representing an unparalleled economic opportunity expected to generate 18,000 Queensland jobs.
The environmental gains are also substantial. Gas-fired power stations emit up to 70 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions than coal-burning plants.
Understandably, many Queenslanders are focused on the land use implications of our industry's growth.
Recent water contamination fears at an underground coal gasification pilot project near Kingaroy have exacerbated concerns. Although underground coal gasification is unrelated to the CSG industry, the State Government's response to suspend activities at the affected site demonstrates safeguards are in place and they are effective.
The Queensland gas industry is subject to the most rigorous environmental approval and monitoring processes in the state's history. LNG projects are going through state environmental approval processes taking several years and which have resulted in more than 1200 conditions per project. This is in addition to federal environmental approval processes.
The Queensland CSG industry is spending many millions of dollars doing the studies and assessments required to deliver a safe and sustainable industry.
But the greatest assurance the community has is that companies are looking at spending tens of billions of dollars to build projects; and in protecting these massive investments, they share the community's desire to have clearly identified, and minimised, all environmental and social risks.
The management of our industry's groundwater impact provides a good example. Even though risks of adverse impacts from CSG activities on groundwater are very unlikely and manageable, extensive monitoring and analysis of changes has already been undertaken to establish baseline data. Impact reports will be submitted to government every year and made public, while data on the status of water bores will also be made public.
The industry understands its future is not just dependent upon its capacity to comply with strict regulations, but also upon the goodwill and support of communities and landholders.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,3,"THE Catholic Church is in the resources business in the US after allowing a company to drill for natural gas beneath 15 cemeteries around the Pittsburgh area.

 The association leased nearly 430ha of land to the company.
Executive director of the association, Annabelle McGannon, said no drilling was under way on any of its cemeteries but acknowledged it could begin any time under the lease.
She said drilling would not interfere with active burials.
``If and when the company would express any interest in drilling, the property owner is in complete control of the location of the drilling activity,'' said Ms McGannon.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"OUT west of Brisbane, where the Queensland turns outback, the locals of a slab of the Surat Basin may soon be making space for as many as 3000 new inhabitants.
It will be a small towns-worth of men and women required to staff what's anticipated to be Queensland's next resource sector bonanza, the Coal Seam Gas (CSG) industry.
 The National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce report, released last month, states that if final approval is given for the Surat Basin CSG development, there will be additional opportunities for workers in all parts of the Queensland resources industry, from mining production managers and engineers of all shapes and sizes, to fitters, electricians, drillers and machinery operators.
It's a very big deal in a state where already 1.8 per cent of the workforce is directly employed in mining, oil and gas operations, but is just one of 91 Queensland resources projects undergoing feasibility studies or awaiting final investment decisions.
And these are in addition to the 22 projects already at an advanced stage of development, which are together worth just over $11 billion.
``The growth potential for the existing industry is quite strong, with demand coming from China, India and other countries for our existing commodities,'' says Greg Lane, deputy chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, the states peak resources industry body.
``Overlaid on top of that, we've got the advent of this whole new industry, the Coal Seam Gas/LNG industry that we have to potentially be able to service with a skilled workforce as well,'' he says.
The QRC is now leading a push to try and turn these shortages into opportunities for students, trainees and apprentices, as well as others looking to take advantage of the industry's average 4.9 per cent employment growth.
As part of this, the Council and its members are working to increase links with universities and schools to encourage young people to consider working in the resources industry.
The Queensland Minerals and Energy Academy (QMEA) is a partnership between the QRC, the Queensland Department of Education, Training and the Arts, and other education providers, to offer resource sector training through state and private schools across the state, with more than 30 schools now signed up.
In addition to this, there are more than 300 scholarships offered by the sector for the states undergraduate and postgraduate students.
One of those benefiting from a QRC scholarship is 18-year-old engineering student at the University Queensland, Peter Stephan.
Stephan was initially attracted by the high profile of the industry, but having had a closer involvement with the resources sector through his scholarship obligations, says he now appreciates the scope of opportunities available for those with an engineering background.
``There's a lot of variety in the work, it has a large effect on our economy, and it is dealing with big topics such as energy and mining,'' says Stephan. ``I think it's a good path to follow at this time.''
Executive Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Queensland, Professor Graham Schaffer, says the scholarship opportunities provided for the students also benefit the institutions involved ,as well as the helping meet growing workforce needs.
``The industry benefits because it helps attract some of the best students into the resources industry and they have an opportunity to evaluate prospective employees,'' he says.
There are also growing efforts to attract women into the resources sector, with Queensland's successful Women in Resources networking and encouragement program now being copied in Western Australia.
Women in Resources is already credited with doubling the percentage of women working the resource field, which now stands at 10.8 per cent.
Mr Lane points to the swing shift concept, which offers women the opportunity to begin shifts after school begins and to leave to be with children after school finishes.
For both men and women, it appears that the extent of career opportunities in resources, both directly and indirectly, is continuing to grow in Queensland and is unlikely to slow any time soon.
``At a time when there is concern about climate change and the environment more generally, this is a way that people can get involved where it counts,'' says Lane.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"ORGANIC farmers Graham and Denyse Back fear losing their Australian and US certification if coal seam gas exploration and production are allowed on or near their Dalby farm.
The Backs' 600ha soy bean, wheat and sheep property sits on CSG reserves held by Arrow Energy - now jointly owned by Shell and PetroChina - which has initiated talks about CSG exploration around their farm.
 Emotions are so high in the prime agricultural region of the Western Downs about the threat of CSG mining to farming land that Mrs Back refuses to speak directly with the company out of fear of saying the wrong thing.
And Mr Back, who has farmed the area for more than 40 years, said he regularly woke up in tears. ``You sort of grieve over it,'' he said.
``I've got this strong emotional attachment to the land - I view it a lot different to a miner.
``He can't understand that. A shareholder can't understand that.''
Farmers are worried the $40 billion in CSG mining projects planned throughout the Surat and Bowen basins - including up to 40,000 mining wells - will lead to a degradation of the Great Artesian Basin and to salinity problems.
The Backs said the threat posed by the chemicals used in the mining process was of particular concern because any chemical traces on their property would nullify their organic certification.
The Backs, who began converting to organic 10 years ago, supply Vitasoy Australia with organic beans. Vitasoy has written to the State Government asking it to show its support for the organic industry.
``We are concerned that the sample wells would likely result in the loss of organic certification for the farms affected,'' a company spokesman said.
Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown said he was not against the CSG industry but was strongly opposed to it using prime agricultural land.
``I don't care if they find bloody gold under it,'' he said.
He said much stricter regulations were required for the industry, rather than ``guidelines and codes of conduct''.
Natural Resources and Mines Minister Stephen Robertson said stricter conditions were being imposed on on CSG mining.
Monitoring would be done to ensure any problems were picked up early.

WITH Shell just about to finalise its takeover of Arrow Energy, there's an interesting line-up of old mates at the head of two of the big players in coal seam gas-to-LNG in Queensland.
 Catherine Tanna, executive vice-president and MD Australia for BG Group is leading its charge to be the first to get a Gladstone LNG project up and running.
Meanwhile, Ann Pickard, who was in town this week to thank Anna Bligh and her Government for their work in bedding down an acceptable, if by no means perfect tax package for the industry, is leading Shell's LNG plans as Shell's Australian chairwoman.
The two know each other well. Until her BG appointment, Tanna was also with Shell and both were based in Africa. Tanna looked after Shell's gas and power division operations across that continent and Pickard, who was based in Nigeria, continent-wide exploration and production.
Pickard, who has a nice self-deprecating sense of humour, told City Beat this week that she and Tanna worked closely together. ``And she (Tanna) is much smarter than me,'' said Pickard.
But she wasn't letting that assessment or their friendship worry her.
``It doesn't mean we are not going to compete,'' she said. ``And I am pretty competitive.''
Stormy weather
WITH the nation heading to the federal election polling booths today it seems the political turmoil in the Queensland State Government is accelerating.
As mentioned in City Beat on July 30, the drums are beating strongly that listing Premier Anna Bligh (now described as ``toxic'' within the party) will not last until Christmas.
Even ``Move Forward'' Julia Gillard lambasted Bligh yesterday in a media conference, saying if you don't like the premier of the state, don't vote against Labor.
Attorney-General Cameron Dick is Bligh's heir apparent but he is apparently playing hard to get and insisting that to take on the big job a few scalps must first be taken. Those include the heads of Boy Wonder Treasurer Andrew Fraser, Deputy Premier Paul Lucas and that political embryo Rachel Nolan, along with Roads Minister Craig Wallace, or Craig ``Who?'' as most would say.
Word is that John Mickel, a likeable and able bodied pollie, would likely slip into the role of deputy premier. Stay tuned.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"SHELL Australia's Ann Pickard doesn't buy the view that there will be a glut of liquefied natural gas in the Asian region in the next decade.
An LNG glut would depress investment and prices for Queensland's budding coal seam gas-to-LNG industry.
 The global oil giant plans to spend $30 billion to $50 billion in Australia during the next decade or so.
Ms Pickard, the recently appointed chair of Shell Australia with responsibility for the company's plan to hugely boost its LNG interests in Western Australia and Queensland, says simply: ``We've got the market.''
``Through PetroChina,'' she adds.
Shell and PetroChina, one of China's biggest energy companies, are about to formally complete their $3.5 billion 50-50 joint venture takeover of Arrow Energy.
The partners will then proceed with their plans for a major LNG facility on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour, while keeping a very open mind about co-operation with the other three major LNG plants slated for the Curtis Island industrial precinct.
Shell's just brought in a ``hotshot project manager'', Ms Pickard said last week.
She says Shell (and PetroChina) expect to make a final investment decision on a Curtis Island investment, which from her point of view might be a stand-alone operation or preferably a joint venture with one of the other three Curtis Island plant hopefuls, by 2012.
She says combining planned Gladstone projects makes sense.
``One project with a whole bunch of trains (LNG processing units) would be best.
``Shareholders don't want us to waste money.''
But she concedes while ``consolidation makes sense, we don't (as an industry) always do the sensible thing, do we.''
On the question of demand, Ms Pickard looks to China, the elephant in the market, but she also points to emerging demand from other Asian economies, such as booming Malaysia - long an LNG exporter but likely soon to be an importer given its national energy company, Petronas, is a joint venturer in Queensland LNG with Santos.
But she trots out these Chinese figures: LNG imports of 6 million tonnes in 2009,
9 million in 2010 and a forecast massive 46 million tonnes in 10 years' time.
Add India and the rest of East and South-East Asia and Ms Pickard says that Shell will spend a lot of money in Australia in the next decade or so.
``We will probably be the biggest investor in Australia. And a fair amount of that will be in Queensland,'' she says.
Ms Pickard, whose last posting was as Shell's exploration and production head in Africa, based in the challenging environment of Nigeria, says: ``There are only a few significant oil and gas exporters - Russia, the Middle East and now Australia.''
She says customers like to diversify a stable supply.
``It is Australia's time, and Queensland's time, to really play into the international market.''

Australian Foundation Investment Co and Argo Investments â€“ both top 20 shareholders within Santos â€“ expressed their surprise at the lack of project-level consolidation in the emerging coal seam sector.
 But both groups backed Santos and its managing director David Knox to deliver the deals that would guarantee the project's development.
 We like Santos as an investment; we've been building up our stake over the past year, and we're encouraged by the direction the managing director has been taking it,  AFIC managing director Ross Barker said.
Santos has been trying for more than a year to secure a long-term LNG sales agreement that would support the construction of GLNG as a two-train, or processing line, project instead of a single-train development.
Simultaneously, the company has been trying to sell up to a 19 per cent stake in the project to a third party as a way of shoring up its balance sheet and reducing its share of capital expenditure costs at the project.
The company has been in discussions with Royal Dutch Shell over a potential combination of their respective Queensland LNG projects.
Argo managing director Rob Patterson said that while there was a feeling in the market that Santos had been  left behind  by progress at BG Group's rival Queensland Curtis LNG project, he would be patient with Santos and believed the company would deliver the best outcome eventually.  They have to sort out the future development in the best way possible for the company, be it on its own or with a partner,  Mr Patterson said.  A bit of consolidation makes sense as there's an awful lot of projects all proposed that will compete with each other for the same resources, but I'm not going to tell them what to do. 
Mr Barker, meanwhile, said he believed Santos had been very focused on finding the best way to maximise the value of GLNG.
 Because there are four different LNG projects [proposed for Queensland] at least, it has surprised us that there wasn't more upfront putting together of interests,  Mr Barker said.  Each company is obviously doing what they think is in the best interests of their shareholders, and obviously the opportunities just haven't been there to date. 
Shares in Santos have rallied strongly since news of the Shell talks was revealed, climbing from $12.13 to as high as $14.30 last week.
Santos is scheduled to report its first-half earnings this Thursday. Earlier this month, it said it expected to record a profit for the period of between $180 million and $200Â million.
While both AFIC and Argo are confident of Santos striking the right deal, not all funds are so sure.
Tim Schroeders from Pengana Capital Management said the fund does not hold Santos due to the uncertainties about GLNG. He said the risk-reward profile within Santos did not stack up at its current price.  It would be a positive in our view if [Shell became operator] as would a sell-down in equity,  he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"British gas giant BG Group continues to stake its claim as holding the most advanced liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, with a contract set to be inked within days to construct a $250 million water treatment plant. BG's Queensland Curtis (QCLNG) project has all its planned capacity earmarked for customers in China, Japan, Singapore and Chile, allowing it to concentrate on developing its multi-billion-dollar project at Gladstone.
The company is tipped to award the  Kenya  water treatment plant contract, near Dalby, to a consortium of US giant GE with its Australian partner Laing O'Rourke. The duo is expected to beat other bidders, including Leighton's subsidiary John Holland in a group with the US Pall Corp and Australia's GHD and a third consortium comprising Thiess with Degremont and Veolia. The deal will further pressure rival promoters Origin Energy, Santos and Royal Dutch Shell, which are competing to sanction rival investments over the next 12 months.
 The BG facility will have the capacity to process 100 megalitres a day of water. BG had flagged an overall capital budget of $450 million to establish, deliver and manage the facility, with plant commissioning scheduled for the first quarter of next year. BG secured key state environmental approvals recently for its venture.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina today formally take control of Queensland coal-seam gas play Arrow Energy.
While the outcome has been in the bag for weeks, the formal settlement will clear the way for Shell to pursue its negotiations with Adelaide-based Santos with renewed vigour.
 Shell is understood to have been reluctant to push the Santos discussions too strongly until the Arrow transaction was officially settled. No doubt this reflects a cautious approach shaped by Shell's missteps with the Foreign Investment Review Board when it tried to take over Woodside in 2001.
The Australian Financial Review revealed last month that Santos and Shell were in talks to combine their Queensland coal-seam gas projects into a single liquefied natural gas development, a deal that would strengthen the projects of both companies.
As it stands, Santos is short of customers and â€“ to an extent â€“ gas to support a second LNG train, or processing line. Developing two trains will enhance the economics of the project by better leveraging the development's infrastructure.
Shell, through its PetroChina partnership and international clout, can help Santos on the customer front, while its gas reserves will allow the pair to eye a much bigger LNG future in Queensland. Combining its project with Santos will also give Shell a better LNG site that is much further progressed than its current asset base.
Santos has been deep in talks with other potential LNG buyers for its project. Santos chief David Knox is likely to be grilled on the progress of those discussions when the company releases its half-year results on Thursday.
Elsewhere, energetic polling hasn't been confined to just the election. It's understood since the Aevum shareholder line opened following the board's rejection of Stockland's $1.50-a-share offer, not a single person has called to voice support for the proposal. All eyes are on Aevum's full-year results tomorrow. Shares were trading at about $1.09 when Stockland first tabled its offer. Aevum has a net tangible asset backing of $1.95. Stockland chief executive Matthew Quinn is expected to raise his offer to above $1.90 to gain traction with the Aevum board. Stockland also holds a 13.1 per cent stake in GPT and 14.9 per cent in FKP Property.
Finally, negative rumblings were emanating from the GrainCorp camp over the weekend with shareholders reluctant for the AWB offer to be increased given it would be dilutive and result in GNC losing control.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The immediate future of Queensland coal seam gas projects valued at more than $35 billion is in doubt with a hung parliament raising the prospect of further environmental delays.
In July Environment Minister Peter Garrett delayed the immediate future of environmental projects being promoted by rivals BG Group and Santos until October in order to consider the long-term environmental impact of the proposed CSG projects.
 Labor's decision to delay the projects may, in part, have contributed to Chris Trevor's defeat as member in the coal region electorate of Flynn, based around the industrial city of Gladstone. Although the LNG projects begin in the south-west gasfields, Gladstone will serve as an export hub for the Â­potential $50 billion industry with thousands of supporting jobs.
Queensland Resources Council chief executive officer Michael Roche said the uncertainty was unnerving for companies making multi-billion dollar investments in the state.  They will want to know pretty quickly what the situation is for them,  said Mr Roche.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Apache Energy, poised to become the biggest natural gas supplier to Western Australia, has taken a swipe at the state's domestic gas reservation policy, warning that instead of Â­increasing supplies for local users, the policy has had the reverse effect and risks driving prices higher.
Mid-size and smaller companies that would normally be keenly seeking new gasfields to develop for sales to WA energy users, were reluctant to explore, said Tom Maher, head of the Australian subsidiary of the US company.
  Our view is [the policy] has put a dampening effect on continued Â­exploration of the North-West Shelf, particularly for the smaller fields,  Mr Maher said. The gas reservation policy mandates that 15Â per cent of gas production from export projects must be kept for the WA domestic market.
But that means smaller specialist domestic gas suppliers, aware of all the gas off WA which is locked up by companies such as Chevron, Shell and Woodside for liquefied natural gas projects, are put off exploring Â­because they know some of that gas must come ashore for the local market, Apache said.
The Houston-based explorer will start production late next year from its $1.08Â billion Devil Creek gas plant south of Dampier. The project, WA's first new domestic gas supply in 17Â years, is a joint venture with Â­Santos and will make Apache the biggest gas supplier to the state, overtaking Woodside Petroleum.
Mr Maher rejected suggestions from the DomGas Alliance, which represents WA's gas consumers, that there was a shortage of gas for locals. According to some WA businesses Â­renegotiating gas contracts, prices have jumped to between $8 â€Šand $9 a gigajoule in the past 18 months from between $3 and $4 a gigajoule, making energy prices in the state some of the highest in the country.
 On all price forecasts, Australia still comes out at some of the lowest gas prices in the world, so I just don't buy the argument,  Mr Maher said.  Obviously our charge is to bring shareholder value and we want to sell gas for as high a price as we can but I can assure you, right now, we are not selling gas at $8 a gigajoule,  he said. He declined to comment on the price of gas being offered.
DomGas Alliance chairman Tony Petersen said he had seen no evidence of the gas reservation policy dampening enthusiasm for exploration among smaller companies.
Apache and Santos have signed Citic Pacific Mining's Sino Iron Ore project as a foundation customer for Devil Creek, the cost of which has jumped from initial estimates of about $850Â million.
Apache is still negotiating other gas sales from Devil Creek, and on sales from its planned $US1.4Â billion ($1.6Â billion) Macedon gas project with BHP Billiton, to be produced through an onshore plant at Ashburton North, near Onslow in WA.
One way for governments to ensure plentiful supplies for the local market would be to more rigorously apply the rules for granting retention leases over undeveloped gas discoveries, Apache said. The company said that would help prevent large companies  warehousing  gas resources, sometimes for decades, for eventual export as LNG.
KEY POINTS Apache Energy says the WA government's gas reservation policy is discouraging further exploration of the North-West Shelf. The DomGas Alliance says it has seen no evidence of the claim.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ORIGIN Energy chief Grant King says his $35 billion Asia-Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas joint venture has caught up to rival Gladstone LNG projects planned by BG Group and Santos, meaning it is time to start consolidation talks.
Mr King told The Australian that a deal with British gas giant BG was an example of one that could have benefits for two projects whose plans to export Queensland's vast coal-seam gas reserves were now at similar stages.
 ``I don't think anybody is in a better position than anyone else. Each of us has strengths and if anything occurs it will be out of a realistic recognition of the strengths of each other's projects,'' he said yesterday. ``If there is a time to test collaboration, now is that time and we will happily participate in those discussions.''
Last month, The Australian revealed Santos was in talks with the Royal Dutch Shell/PetroChina joint venture to merge two rival CSG-to-LNG projects on Gladstone's Curtis Island.
Until recently, Origin and APLNG joint venture partner ConocoPhillips had been lagging Santos and BG. But a federal government delay to Santos and BG's environmental approval decisions until October had Origin yesterday claiming it expected to receive its permit at the same time as its rivals. While that timetable could be delayed by uncertainty around last weekend's federal election, Origin still hopes to make a final investment decision on APLNG this year.
Mr King said APLNG's strengths were its quality gas reserves and a superior record of converting contingent gas reserves to the more reliable proven and probable (2P) category.
Asked where Origin was not so strong and what it would seek in collaboration, Mr King said: ``At the other end of the spectrum, BG is a portfolio marketer and has already evidently secured customers independent of the progress on their project -- I think you can say these are two bookends.''
Progress on Gladstone LNG is expected to be the main near-term driver of Origin, so talk of its progress overshadowed a 91 per cent drop in full-year net profit after tax to $612m.
The drop came because of a big profit booked on the sale of CSG ground in Queensland the previous year. Underlying profit of $585m, up 10 per cent, was shy of consensus of about $610m.
A final dividend of 25c a share is payable on September 28.
Origin's shares fell 29c to $15.31 yesterday. The company said it expected underlying profit to grow 15 per cent this year.
Mr King said Origin expected to sell equity in the Australia-Pacific LNG joint venture to any foundation customers. He would not say how much he was prepared to sell, but pointed to a recent BG deal that gave away 5 per cent of the project and a Chevron deal for its Wheatstone project in Western Australia that gave away 15-20 per cent.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"A COALITION win could delay the timing of Origin Energy's $35 billion liquefied natural gas project in Queensland.
Unveiling a worse than expected 10 per cent rise in underlying profit yesterday, Origin boss Grant King also conceded the time had come for rival Queensland LNG projects to discuss merger deals.
 ``If there ever was going to be a time for those discussions, it would be now,'' Mr King said. ``It would be disingenuous of me to say the time has come and then not to participate.''
Origin and joint venture partner US oil giant ConocoPhilips are behind the Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project.
They want to develop a potential 18 million tonne a year LNG plant in Gladstone.
APLNG has superior gas reserves to its three Queensland rivals but many analysts consider it lags behind because it is yet to sign a customer.
Its rivals are BG Group, a joint Shell-PetroChina venture and a venture between Santos and Malaysia's Petronas.
Mr King said the perception last year was that APLNG was ``substantially behind'' BG Group and Santos in gaining regulatory approval but ``that gap has closed''.
Origin expects to make a final investment decision by December and hopes to have all state and federal regulatory approvals by year's end.
``If the prior government had been returned, we would have thought those consents will come forward on the timetable that was articulated,'' Mr King said.
``There is no question there is some uncertainty as a result of the current political situation.''
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said APLNG may struggle to sell enough gas this year to justify a two-unit processing plant and may also face delays because of the election deadlock. He said APLNG may have to push back a final investment decision until as late as mid-2011.
Origin yesterday reported its net profit of $612 million, from $6.19 billion the previous year when its result was skewed by a one-off sale of 50 per cent of APLNG to ConocoPhilips and other factors.
Origin missed expectations for its underlying profit, which rose 10 per cent to $585 million, less than the 15 per cent rise the company had forecast.
``That (underlying profit) includes provisioning for an expanded exploration program that we talked about this time last year and didn't include in guidance we gave,'' Mr King said.
IG Markets strategist Ben Potter said that despite Origin failing to reach its expected profit number, the market did not seem too concerned with the result, with company shares only underperforming the broader stock market slightly.
Origin fell 29 or 1.86 per cent, to $15.31.

Now is the time for Queensland's liquefied natural gas projects to consolidate, according to the chief executive of utility Origin Energy.
 Grant King on Thursday said with the leading LNG proposals in Queensland all closing in on final Â­investment decisions [FID] in the coming months, it made sense for the various proponents to discuss ways of combining their projects.
 I do think the time has come,  Mr King said, adding he expected negotiations to take place between the parties in the coming months.
 I think people will explore those possibilities [for collaboration] because people now have stabilised what their FID is, and we and others I'm sure will be curious to know what other gains can be made. 
Origin and its joint venture partner ConocoPhillips have been targeting FID on their estimated $17.1Â billion Australia Pacific LNG project by the end of this year, although Origin yesterday stressed that meeting that time frame was contingent on locking in a long-term customer for the project.
England's BG Group and Adelaide-based Santos are both awaiting final environmental approvals from the federal government before they can approve their respective Queensland LNG projects.
Mr King said Origin had made up ground on its two rivals over the past year, with Origin and ConocoPhillips benefiting from lessons about the approvals process offered by the case of BG and Santos.
While BG is believed to be leaning towards developing the Queensland Curtis LNG project on its own, Santos has had talks with Royal Dutch Shell over a potential combination of their respective assets in the state.
Mr King's comments came as Origin announced a $612 million profit for 2010, down 91 per cent from the 2009 result, which was inflated by the $9.4 billion sale of a 50 per cent stake in APLNG to ConocoPhillips.
Underlying profit of $585 million was up 10 per cent from 2009, below analyst consensus of $614 million.
Mr King said he expected underlying earnings to grow by 15 per cent again in 2011.
The final dividend was held steady at 25Â¢ a share.
Mr King publicly confirmed for the first time that Origin expected to sell part of its equity stake in APLNG as part of its efforts to secure a foundation LNG customer for the project. While he would not say what size stake the company was considering selling, sources said it was likely to be between 5 and 10 per cent.
While Origin is also considered a likely candidate to participate in the eventual privatisation of the NSW government's power generation and retailing assets, the company indicated it was unlikely to be interested in any assets up for sale from former Babcock & Brown satellite Alinta.

Oil Search is pushing to bring forward drilling at the Hides gas field in Papua New Guinea in a bid to accelerate a potential expansion of its $US15 billion ($16.7 billion) liquefied natural gas project there.
 Two planned wells at Hides in the Highlands region of PNG are scheduled for 2012 but moving them forward to early 2011  would make a lot of sense , Oil Search managing director Peter Botten said yesterday.
Construction work started earlier this year at the ExxonMobil-led PNG LNG project, which is due to start deliveries to customers in China, Taiwan and Japan in early 2014 from a two-train project. Adding a third LNG production unit is worth $2 per share to Oil Search, Wall Street research firm Sanford C Bernstein says.
The potential expansion  adds a lot of value to our business,  Mr Botten told the AFR.
 That represents an opportunity that we are very keen to follow up,  he said.  We're very confident that that philosophy is shared by the rest of the joint venture and the government. 
Oil Search yesterday reported a 49Â per cent surge in first-half net profit to $US52.9 million, buoyed by higher oil sales volumes and prices. Leaving aside gains from the sale of investments, the $US49 million result comfortably beat the market consensus of $US44 million, mostly due to lower-than-anticipated costs.
The company, partly owned by the PNG government, maintained the target date of 2014 for first LNG sales from the venture and the estimated total budget.
But it cautioned that the start of full-scale work on the project had inflated labour and contractor costs, while higher oil prices have driven up fuel costs and royalties. Work is due to pick up sharply this half.
So far the PNG LNG venture has invested about $US1.8 billion, or 12Â per cent of the project's total capex budget, Macquarie Equities says.
Oil Search expected to spend about $US1 billion on the project this year, Mr Botten said.
Production gained 4 per cent in the half to 3.95 million barrels of oil equivalent and the company retained its forecast for full-year production of 7.2 million to 7.4 million boe.
A major strategic review due to be completed by Oil Search later this year could lead to divestments, potentially including the company's Middle East business, which Mr Botten has previously flagged could be considered for sale after the completion of drilling this year.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,3,"A new package of reforms was announced this week providing landholders who deal with the coal seam gas industry with more information and greater access to government services.
In addition to the existing requirement to advise government, CSG operators will now have to notify affected landholders about their intention to drill a well or bore.
 Also when work is completed or altered, the companies must also inform landholders of their intention to carry out technical, scientific or seismic surveys and when that work will be finished.
 From listening to landholders and others, it is clear that there was concern about the potential impact of fraccing or creating cracks in underground coal seam to increase the flow and recovery of gas,  Resources minister Stephen Robertson has said.
 The government has already announced a ban on the use of benzene and other BTEX chemicals in fraccing and ensure landholders are aware of fraccing activities. 
Other changes will include employing an extra 20 staff in South-West Queensland to respond to groundwater and environmental complaints, while the Department of Environmental and Resource Management has made a commitment to sample around 300 monitoring bores in 2011/12.
This is to ensure the accuracy of information provided by the CSG operators through environmental authority reporting.
CSG operators are to assess landholder bore status before drilling to support their 'make good' obligations and streamline dispute resolutions and they must also notify affected landholders about works such as the drilling of bores.
CSG companies will also be required to advise landholders, as well as government, about a range of fraccing activities including the proposed timing and chemical uses.
The service is expected to be fully operational within two months.
A CSG information telephone hotline has also been established.
Phone 13 25 23 between 8am and 6pm Monday to Friday.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"GRANT King's comments that Gladstone's liquefied natural gas hopefuls should start talking consolidation received mixed reactions from analysts and the same old response from likely partner BG Group. The confident Origin Energy boss wants to get moving, despite it and partner ConocoPhillips being yet to seal offtake agreements or give the final investment go-ahead for their APLNG project. But he mustn't have been hugely surprised when BG yesterday ran its standard line that it would consider collaboration ``where it does not slow us down''. A spokesperson declined to go further on a BG-Origin deal, but with Santos in talks with Shell-PetroChina, could this be next? The key could be federal government delays to environmental approvals until October, which provides ``a window'' for collaboration to be assessed, according to RBS analyst Jason Mabee.
  Unlike BG, which already has offtake deals in place, Origin is still talking to potential customers, which Goldman Sachs's Aiden Bradley sees as key to making an investment decision by year's end. Bradley says gas agreements with rivals Shell or Santos would be a ``logical alternative'' should Origin fail to find offtake partners, but its 50:50 joint venture with ConocoPhillips could limit negotiations. Macquarie's Gavin Maher also brushed off the impact of government approvals on Origin due to its lack of customers, saying it would be more crucial to BG's project. But UBS's David Leitch was more focused on the NSW government's asset sell-off, tipping Origin to buy retail electricity provider EnergyAustralia, valued at about $2 billion, and an associated gentrader. The good news for investors is you are ``not paying a dime for any LNG upside'' at the moment, according to Mabee. He also says there may be another acquisition from left field, outside of the NSW assets and APLNG.
Redflex future uncertain
SHAREHOLDERS of takeover target Redflex Holdings yesterday received little insight into the future of their company in an otherwise litigation- and currency-marred full-year result.

The underlying figures looked a bit better, with profit up 28.7 per cent to $12.4m and EBITDA rising 18.7 per cent to $54m. Investors weren't too concerned, with Redflex closing 4c lower at $2.56.

Action in the west
THE swank eateries of West Perth aren't strangers to a deal, and there's a good chance they're doing some business at the moment. Hawkley Oil and Gas, run by ex-BNP Paribas dealmaker Richard Reavley, is said to be eyeing funds from a US entity for a Ukraine asset. The tiddler recently backdoor-listed via biotech Incitive and could give away a stake in return for the cash. Elsewhere we hear internet kiosk developer Pienetworks is said to be pondering an equity injection at 1.5c to raise about $3m. And Tony Sage's quest for change at iron ore explorer Padbury Mining isn't getting any less entertaining, with Fe Limited lodging its bidder's statement with ASIC for an offmarket takeover. It's all very complicated, but basically a condition of the bid is the replacement of Padbury directors Luke Innes and Colin Stirling with Sage and Fe directors Mark Gwynne and Paul Kelly. The trouble is, Padbury and its dissenting shareholders have different views on whether the September 8 meeting will occur.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"News
SANTOS will sell at least 15 per cent of its Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project to Asian buyers in an effort to finalise binding offtake agreements and make a final investment decision by the end of the year.
 In announcing a first-half underlying profit of $210 million, up 121 per cent on the previous half-year, Santos said the door for consolidation of LNG projects in Gladstone was  still open  but consolidation was unlikely before it made an investment decision on its first LNG train. Santos has been rumoured to be considering a multibillion-dollar tie-up with Royal Dutch Shell, which is working on its own Gladstone LNG project.
Santos shares rose 23Â¢, or 1.6 per cent, to $14.07 after the company maintained its production guidance of between 49 million and 52 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) for the full year. This was despite first-half production falling 9 per cent to 24.2 million boe due to flooding in central Australia and a planned 35-day maintenance shutdown at its Darwin LNG project.
Santos matched the 22Â¢ dividend from the same time last year. The dividend will be paid on October 6.
Chief executive David Knox said an announcement of offtake agreements and new equity partners for GLNG was awaiting government approval by the Asian countries. Santos owns 60 per cent of the GLNG project, with joint-venture partner Petronas holding 40 per cent.
 We are not talking to the buyers about non-binding heads of agreement or memorandums of understanding,  he said.  These are binding, fully termed deals that we are working through, so they are very complex and they are taking some time. These (buyers) want to see volumes in 2014 . . . they want to negotiate with projects that they have confidence in and they do value equity participation, which we are able to offer. 
Santos has always said it will retain majority ownership in GLNG, but it has lowered its desired level from 50 per cent to 45 per cent.
Korea Gas and China's Sinopec have previously confirmed that they are also in the hunt to buy gas from the project and a potential equity stake.
Mr Knox said Santos was not engaged in any consolidation talks, and played down speculation that it would combine its LNG muscle in Queensland with Shell in the foreseeable future.
 My door is open but that's not what my focus is,  he said. Santos could resume talks once it had made a final investment decision on its first train and was on the way to its second, he said.
Mr Knox said he did not believe a federal Liberal government would delay environmental approval for GLNG but called for the uncertainty about the government to be sorted out in the next few weeks.
He said about 50 people had been hired for Santos and GDF Suez's Bonaparte floating LNG project in the Timor Sea, which is expected to produce 2 million tonnes of LNG a year.
 We are going to drill a few appraisal/development wells next year in order to find out the hydrocarbon content and the mix of oil and gas in the reservoir so we can design the facilities appropriately,  he said.
 So that will lead us to an investment decision maybe in late 2013 or 2014 for first LNG in say 2018, but after GLNG gets over the line and after PNG LNG gets over the line.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"OIL and gas producer Santos wants to sell at least a further 15 per cent stake in its Queensland liquefied natural gas joint venture before committing to a final investment decision later this year.
Santos expects to own a maximum of 45 per cent of the proposed Gladstone LNG development when it makes a final decision to proceed.
 It currently owns 60 per cent of the project, with Malaysia's Petronas holding the balance.
``Forty-five per cent is a good guide of where we'll end up, but there is a possibility that we could go a bit lower,'' Santos CEO David Knox said yesterday.
``We'll always remain the largest shareholder.''
The Gladstone LNG project is one of four such projects slated for development in Queensland.
Royal Dutch Shell, which has a rival venture, has ramped up its expertise on the ground in Queensland.
It has relocated Hilary Mercer, the former manager of Sakhalin-2, Russia's first LNG project, to Queensland to head up its Gladstone project.
Ms Mercer led construction at Sakhalin-2, in Russia's far east, a development Shell calls ``one of the most challenging engineering feats ever achieved''.
Earlier this week Origin boss Grant King said the time had come for rival projects to discuss merger proposals.
But Mr Knox said while Santos was interested in consolidation in the sector, that would be difficult to achieve between now and a final investment decision.
Mr Knox said although Santos would be able to sign off on the development at the end of the year without bringing in a new customer, negotiations with more potential Asian buyers were at an advanced stage.
He said these potential LNG buyers were also seeking to buy a stake in the project.
``They are looking for real participation,'' he said.
Korea Gas Corp, the world's biggest importer of LNG, has said it would complete talks with Santos on buying a stake by the end of September.
Santos yesterday posted a near doubling in first-half net profit due to higher commodity prices and lower exploration costs.
Net profit for the half year to June 30 was $198 million, up 94 per cent from the previous first half.
The market liked the news, sending Santos shares 23c, or 1.66 per cent, higher to $14.07. It declared an interim dividend of 22c a share.
Down the line
* Santos expects to sell another 15% of its Gladstone LNG joint venture
* Also wants to sign up more customers before year's end
* Talks down LNG merger opportunities
* First half net profit jumped 94% to $198m
* Shares rise 1.7% to $14.07

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"AGL Energy flagged it will not rush into an early sale of its stake in the Moranbah coal seam gas venture in Queensland to new partners Shell and PetroChina, believing the asset will gain in value as reserves rise.
Chief executive Michael Fraser said yesterday that he expected  further significant reserves upgrades over time  in the Moranbah region in the Bowen Basin, which is earmarked to supply a multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas project planned by Shell and PetroChina after their $3.45 billion takeover of Arrow Energy.
 AGL had not yet had any discussions with Shell and PetroChina on the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Moranbah, Mr Fraser said.
 We see that that asset is going to just increase in value and what we decide to do in the longer term does remain for the longer term,  Mr Fraser said.  The balance sheet is in good shape and we'll bide our time. 
Analysts have valued AGL's stake in Moranbah at up to $1.4 billion. More likely divestments in the nearer term are the New Zealand and Western Australian exploration interests held by Mosaic Oil once AGL completes its $30 million takeover of the junior.
AGL is buying Mosaic for the target's almost depleted Silver Springs gas fields in Queensland, which it wants to develop into a gas storage facility to be used by UK gas company BG to support its LNG project in Gladstone.
AGL reported a 43 per cent boost to its Australian gas reserves in the last financial year to 1578 petajoules, mostly from the emerging Gloucester Basin near Newcastle. It signalled likely further gains there plus some initial reserves to be certified in the next two or three months in the Hunter Valley.
 Gloucester and the Hunter in combination with Camden are going to become fairly significant sources of gas supply for the NSW market and that leaves us in very good shape for the longer term,  Mr Fraser said. Angela Macdonald-Smith

Santos's drawn-out search for more customers for its $16 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project looks to be almost over, with the company waiting on a handful of approvals before it can announce its long-awaited deal.
 Chief executive David Knox said the deals were awaiting clearance from the customers' boards as well as, in some instances, the customers' national governments.
 We're well through the process, but it is subject to approvals either from the authorities or the final approvals from the companies we're negotiating with,  Mr Knox told The Australian Financial Review.
 We understand who our customers are likely to be, but we need them to approve the deals. 
Sources close to the situation said that the most likely buyer was the state-owned company Korea Gas.
Santos has been trying to secure another buyer for GLNG for more than a year, with the company needing another committed long-term customer before it can warrant the construction of a two-train (or processing line) LNG project.
A two-train project would be able to leverage off infrastructure built to support the first train and improve the project's overall economics.
Santos had been on the verge of a deal earlier this year, but that was derailed by the announcement of the resource super profits tax. Mr Knox said potential buyers were comfortable with both the compromise tax deal and the current federal government uncertainty.
The sales deals will see Santos sell at least a 15 per cent stake in GLNG to the customers, reducing its share from 60 per cent to no more than 45 per cent. Malaysia's Petronas owns a 40 per cent stake in the project.
Mr Knox's comments came as Santos recorded a 94 per cent jump in first-half net profit to $198 million due primarily to higher oil and gas prices. The result had been well expected after the company earlier this month provided guidance for $180 million to $200 million profit.
The interim dividend was maintained at 22Â¢ a share.
Mr Knox said GLNG was unlikely to be combined with any other LNG projects in the region in the short term.
While Santos has previously been in talks with other companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Mr Knox said he would not be revisiting those discussions until GLNG had been approved for development.
 I've been enthusiastic about collaboration for a long time and I would have very much welcomed being able to announce some success on that front over the last 18 months or so, and we've been unable to do so,  he said.  It's not something I'd close the door on completely for the future, but right now my focus is on delivering the first train. 
Mr Knox said it was possible the company would need to raise equity to finance its share of construction costs at Gladstone, but promised that any raising would be open to all shareholders in the company.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"SANTOS was looking yesterday at tying up another major customer for its Gladstone liquefied natural gas project, with Korea Gas Corp said to be about to take a 10 per cent stake.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the company was close to signing up at least one significant new customer.
 Kogas is one of Asia's biggest LNG buyers and has confirmed in the past it has been talking to Santos.
Mr Knox said on Thursday that Santos would probably sell 15 per cent of the LNG project to customers, dropping its 60 per cent stake in the massive project to 45 per cent - meaning another 5 per cent of the planned Curtis Island plant in Gladstone Harbour remains available to another player.
It is suggested Kogas is in the final stage of talks with Santos to buy more than 2 million tonnes a year of LNG from the plant - with that deal and its equity stake expected to be announced as early as next week.
China's Sinopec also held talks with Santos.
Santos and Malaysian partner Petronas have already agreed to sell up to 3 million tonnes a year of LNG from the project to Petronas.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"Drilling to begin offshore
EXPLORATORY drilling for natural gas will take place about 30 kilometres from the coast of Port Stephens in October.
 Advent Energy, which has government approval to extract gas and holds the state's only offshore petroleum licence, said its first exploration well would be directly east of Newcastle.
The well is about 55 kilometres from Newcastle, and about 30 kilometres from the nearest land site at Boat Harbour.
Advent has contracted the 2560 megaton rig Ocean Patriot to conduct the drilling.
The executive director of Advent's parent company MEC Resources, David Breeze, said earlier this month it would be the first time such drilling had occurred off the NSW coast.
 The state and federal governments are looking for gas as a source of electricity generation,  Mr Breeze said.
 Gas-fired power stations produce 60 per cent less carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired power stations. 
The objective of the project is to drill a well 826 metres below the ocean floor and to test for the presence of gas.
Advent is licensed to explore an 8100-square-kilometre area from Wollongong to Newcastle.
Gas reserves in the area are estimated at 13.2 trillion cubic feet and valued at about $50 billion.
The gas could also have industrial and domestic uses, and the project could create 300 full-time and 2000 construction jobs.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Such a move would likely only come after Santos has locked in its new customer and Gladstone LNG has been approved for development.
It looks increasingly likely that Santos will join the ranks of equity raising double-dippers. Less than 18 months after tapping shareholders for $3 billion, Santos seems almost certain to hit them for more cash before the year is out. Last year's raising was primarily to cover Santos's 13.5 per cent share of development costs at the $US15 billion ($16.9 billion) Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project while maintaining the company's BBB+ investment grade credit rating.
 The same concern means Santos could raise up to another $3 billion for development of its $16 billion Gladstone LNG project in Queensland, despite other financing options being open to it.
Santos is closing in on a deal to sell at least a 15 per cent stake in GLNG as part of its long-term gas sale agreements, with state-owned company Korea Gas considered a near-certainty to emerge as Santos's partner in the project. Such a deal would deliver up to $1 billion cash to Santos, as well as reduce its stake in the project â€“ and therefore its share of capital costs â€“ from 60 to 45 per cent.
Santos has locked in more than $2 billion in new finance facilities and will pursue export credit agencies for more, although all that could dent its credit rating if further equity isn't raised. Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood estimates Santos needs about $2.9 billion in equity to meet its objectives, while Macquarie's Adrian Wood is tipping a raising of up to $2.5 billion.
Santos has pledged to give all existing shareholders first dibs under any equity raising. Such a move would likely come only after Santos has locked in its new customer and GLNG has been approved for development.
That could mean a busy few weeks for chief executive David Knox in December, when a final investment decision on GLNG is due to be made.
JB Hi-Fi has a strong track record of surprising the market but after five years of solid growth, many wonder whether it has anything left up its sleeve. Some analysts think the internet might be its next trick. The market darling has more than quadrupled its share price over the past five years and sales of iPads and smartphones helped it achieve a record profit of $119 million in 2010 despite soft consumer spending.
JB has plans to roll out up to 15 new stores a year, giving hope it can continue to grow in a sluggish economy. But the retailer has been quiet about its website, which some analysts say is among the best in the sector. The internet could be the next kick to JB's business and it hasn't yet been accounted for in the share price. Margins are better online because there is no haggling, so products tend to go for full price.
But the web also opens JB up to a host of low-cost competitors. One fund manager says while he sees the website as an advantage, he does not include it in his valuation because its benefit is hard to quantify. He says one reason JB might be quiet about its website is because its main competitive advantage is its knowledgeable staff. As JB opens more and more stores, it would rather do battle in the street than in cyberspace.
Should Foster's Group shareholders rule out Asahi as a potential bidder for Carlton & United Breweries after the Japanese group's $364 million deal to buy Peter Brooks's P&N Beverages? Goldman Sachs analyst Ian Abbott thinks Asahi's ambitions in Australia will be restricted to the soft drink market for now â€“ not least because this deal will take the company's gearing ratio 3 percentage points above its preferred 70 per cent.
Asahi, which with SAB Miller is one of the contenders for Foster's beer division, is trying to muscle in on Coca-Cola Amatil's distribution and market strength.
Schweppes has about 22 per cent of the market and P&N, owner of brands including Waterfords mineral water, has 8 per cent. Goldman says the key risk to Coca-Cola, which leads the carbonated beverage market with 65 per cent share, is Asahi using its increased size to become a stronger competitor in the distribution channel.
Schweppes and P&N have struggled on this front and Goldman thinks it will be a while before Asahi makes inroads.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"A delegation from the far west has seen first hand the effects of coal seam gas mining during a visit to Queensland.
Barwon MP Kevin Humphries has led the tour to Dalby and Roma, which is part of investigations to see whether it would be viable in New South Wales.
 He says gas exploration has the potential to bring infrastructure and investment to the region and is a valuable low emissions energy source.
Mr Humphries says the group has also seen the benefits of mining projects.
 If companies get it right certainly the economic benefits over the next 20 to 30 years are quite significant,  he said.
 Interestingly we've looked at what they do with their water; they're cleaning up some of their water that's a bit salty and using it for irrigation. 
Mr Humphries says there are concerns about the effects of gas exploration on farming land and underground water aquifers and any potential developments in New South Wales must not have an adverse impact on the local agricultural industry and must be adhere to strict rules.
Meanwhile, a group of experts is set to visit the far west to brief local landholders and stakeholders on the potential of coal seam gas.
Mr Humphries says he hopes the experts will visit the before Christmas.
 What I would like to do is bring some of the hydrology experts that have obviously been involved in the development here down to our area as well, because they are very well informed, they are leading experts, and I think part of the exercise is that we've got, particularly over the next 12 months, to help people become better informed of what's going on in their own area,  he said.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"Still waiting for approval
THE company that plans to begin exploratory drilling for natural gas 55 kilometres off Newcastle in October has not received state and federal approval for the project.
 The NSW government insisted the project would be closely scrutinised, amid concerns about its environmental effects.
Advent Energy executive director David Breeze said yesterday the project was on track, despite the lack of approvals.
 We've been through a careful and detailed process of evaluation with the government,  Mr Breeze said.
A NSW Department of Industry and Investment spokeswoman said the company was expected to apply soon for  approval to drill an exploration well .
She said the state and Commonwealth jointly regulated exploration activities off the coast.
 Under Commonwealth legislation, the operator is required to comply with a strict and comprehensive approvals' process before any offshore exploration activity can commence,  the spokeswoman said.
 This includes assessment of a detailed environment plan,  she said.
The department said it was awaiting from the company a modified environment plan for the drilling, which would take  up to 30 days to reassess .
The department had released a summary of a separate environment plan for the company's geophysical survey of the area done in June.
That plan said 30 migratory and 27 threatened species could occur in the area including whales, marine turtles, sharks, birds and fish.
Mr Breeze said the new plan would be lodged  in the very near future  with an evaluation of the rig, helicopters and boats to be used.
The department spokeswoman said the drilling site would be 27 kilometres to 55 kilometres offshore and drilling would take about 30 days.
Lake Macquarie City councillor Phillipa Parsons has raised concerns about the project polluting and degrading the sea and beaches and the potential for leaks.
 The government should not allow a mining company to risk our coastline for a speculative profit-driven mining venture,  she said.
Advent Energy will operate the well through its subsidiary company Asset Energy. The company holds the state's only offshore petroleum licence to explore an 8100 square kilometre area from Wollongong to Newcastle.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Santos chief executive David Knox has moved to play down speculation that the Adelaide-based oil and gas producer is weighing up an offer for NSW coal seam gas explorer Eastern Star Gas.
Speaking to The Australian Financial Review after the release of Santos's first-half results last week, Mr Knox said Santos was content with its existing 19.9 per cent shareholding in Eastern Star Gas and 35 per cent interest in various Eastern Star leases.
  It's not something we're considering at this time, that's for sure,  he said when asked about the recent speculation of a Santos offer for Eastern Star.
 We're very happy with our holding and we're very happy with the underlying performance of the assets, and we're just continuing to support Eastern Star in developing their acreage and in parallel developing our own acreage. 
Mr Knox also stopped short of Â­endorsing Eastern Star's plans to convert coal seam gas into liquefied natural gas at a specialist facility in Newcastle.
Eastern Star has moved aggressively in recent months to advance its plans for a Newcastle LNG export Â­facility, recently announcing its Â­intentions to acquire an industrial site at the port for $25 million. It has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese companies Hitachi and Toyo Engineering to Â­investigate the development of a small-scale LNG plant.
In the past month, analysts at both RBS Morgans and Credit Suisse have named Santos as a likely potential suitor for Eastern Star.
RBS Morgans analyst Nik Burns said an Â­acquisition of Eastern Star would give Santos sufficient reserves to support a doubling of its proposed $16 billion Gladstone LNG (GLNG) project in Queensland.
 Corporate activity in Eastern Star seems to be a distinct possibility in the next six months,  Mr Burns said.
Mr Knox said Santos was very pleased with its investments in NSW coal seam gas leases, which Â­included its own coal seam gas acreage. Santos had drilled about 25 new wells on its own NSW acreage in the past year and was likely to maintain that pace into the future.
Asked whether the best path for commercialisation of the assets lay in exporting the gas through Newcastle or piping it north for incorporation into Santos's GLNG project, Mr Knox said it was still too early to make a decision.  We're still in the appraisal stage to find out exactly what we've got,  he said.
 Once you establish what the Â­resource base is, then you can really decide on what the best options are. 
In July last year, Santos paid $300 million for the 35 per cent stake in Eastern Star tenements, plus $176 million for Hillgrove Â­Resources' 19.9 per cent stake in the company.
Santos has agreed to make a bonus payment to Hillgrove if it or another company acquires Eastern Star Â­before January next year.
The Newcastle LNG option was Â­excluded from the LNG production projections Santos released with its results last week.
Santos is also closing in on a long-awaited gas sales deal with state-owned giant Korea Gas, that will Â­reportedly result in Santos selling at least a 10 per cent stake in GLNG and lock in Kogas as a long-term customer. China's Sinopec is believed to be Â­interested in a similar deal.
Santos's LNG marketing expertise will be significantly bolstered from today when the former head of marketing from the North-West Shelf project, Peter Cleary, joins the company as vice-president strategy and corporate development.
 Peter is one of the leading, if not the leading marketer of LNG in Asia; he's a very well respected and well known individual and we're very pleased he's joining the team,  Mr Knox said.
Meanwhile, Mr Knox confirmed that Santos had slowed work on its proposed development of an $800 million, 500 megawatt gas-fired power station at Shaw River in Victoria.
 We've got it to a stage now where we could start to go down the path of final investment decisions. But before we go down that path we need a much better understanding of what's happening with carbon prices and electricity prices,  he said.
 It's been very actively worked but it's now moving into a slower progress as we await what the new Â­administration's view is on carbon prices going forward.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Woodside Petroleum's ambitious target to have its company-defining $13 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project running by February faces more pressure Â­after revelations it is reviewing key parts of the gas plant due to Â­cyclone safety concerns.
Construction workers at the Pluto site, about 190 kilometres offshore from Karratha in Western Australia, told The Australian Financial Review the flare stack, designed to deal with the unsafe build-up of gas, might need to be modified because insurers were refusing to provide cover as it was not cyclone-proof.
 The site typically has up to five tropical cyclones a year and talks are under way to establish whether the plant fulfils the requirements to gain a cyclone-proof rating.
A Woodside spokesman said the Pluto project was on its February target and would not comment further on the speculation.
 Pluto is a multibillion-dollar, multi-year project taking in dozens of different contractors working on many different packages of the offshore and onshore elements of the development,  the spokesman said.
 We have no intention of providing commentary on the progress of individual work performed by individual contractors. 
Adding to concerns about the project's timetable, industry sources confirmed to the AFR that mining services company UGL had been stripped of some of its work on the LNG plant as a result of delays.
US contractor CB&I, which was already working at the Pluto site, has recently picked up additional work, although it is not known if this was taken off a company contracted to the project.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte defended UGL but confirmed their scope of work on the project had changed.
 There's been a little bit of shift to what their work has been compared to some of the other contractors, but that's not unusual during a project, that happens,  Mr Voelte said after the company announced its first-half results earlier this month.
 I don't particularly want to point out United as being different to any other contractor up there. Let me just say that we expect and wish that United does well off the contract and makes money. We want them to do well, we want them to work for us in the future. 
Mr Voelte said the scale of the Pluto project â€“ 4.3 million tonnes a year of LNG production is forecast â€“ would always mean changes in contractor work flow.
 We do natural shifts of work Â­assignments as sometimes some work gets done faster, they have more people available in the company, they get other assignments, they struggle in getting people to site . . . there's always that sort of adjustment that goes on,  he added.
A UGL spokesman denied they had lost any work on the Pluto project, saying contractors were Â­already at capacity when the scope of works on the project increased.
Mr Voelte said it was too early to determine which contractors would win work on Â­expansion projects.
 We will do an evaluation when the job's over.
 I would have to say I know nothing right now that would eliminate any contractor that we have on site at this time from future contracts,  Mr Voelte said.
Unions are waging a broader campaign to raise their presence on WA LNG construction projects, and early battles are being fought at Pluto.
An April strike by 12 crane drivers employed by Mammoet Australia came close to stalling progress at the project. Earlier this year about 2000 construction workers went on strike over accommodation policy; the Â­action was later ruled illegal.
At its half-year results briefing on August 18, Woodside said the Pluto project was 92 per cent complete and its scheduled target of starting up the gas processing facility by the end of February was contingent on a  productive industrial relations environment  and the weather.
Any further schedule slippage at the project should not be significant, Woodside said, given a number of key milestones had been reached.
Delays to Pluto would cost Woodside an estimated $32.5 million a week, according to the company.
KEY POINTS Insurers might not provide cover as the plant may not be cyclone-proof. The plant site typically experiences five tropical cyclones a year. Delays would cost an estimated $32.5 million a week.

Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade had their biggest one-day rise since Aug 5 before paring gains as dry weather threatened about a million tonnes of an already depleted wheat crop in Western Australia, a region which accounts for about half of Australia's wheat exports.
Dry weather in Argentina and rains in Germany, on top of the severe drought in Russia, added to concerns of tightening global supplies of wheat.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,3,"MARK COLVIN: It'll be a massive petrochemical plant with a port for huge gas tankers to come and go and the Premier of Western Australia says it'll be good for tourism. It's the proposed liquefied natural gas hub near Broome. And a Curtin University study says it would pose a serious threat to the region's tourism image as a place of wilderness and escape.
David Weber reports.
 DAVID WEBER: The Curtin University study says tourism is more valuable to the regional economy than the gas plant would be. The Wilderness Society's Peter Robertson says Broome is set to benefit from whale-watching tourism.
PETER ROBERTSON: It's got a very bright future based on industries like tourism. Tourism is already a huge industry in the region. It employs over 500 Indigenous people which is probably the biggest single employer of Indigenous people in the Kimberley. The scope for growth is massive. The whale-watching industry is only just starting to take off.
DAVID WEBER: The Curtin study says the Kimberley's tourism brand is based on its wildlife and its vast unspoiled coastlines. It says industrialisation would place these values under threat.
Peter Robertson:
PETER ROBERTSON: We believe that the industry is being let down by both the state and the federal tourism ministers. We are very concerned that they are not getting a strong representation by Liz Constable or Martin Ferguson.
We don't know obviously who is going to be the next federal tourism minister but we certainly hope that they are going to split the portfolio so you don't have the same minister as you do with Martin Ferguson who's both tourism and resource development because it's a huge conflict of interest.
DAVID WEBER: Mr Robertson says an environmental impact statement is expected to be released in the coming months.
PETER ROBERTSON: It has to look not only at the environmental issues but also the social and economic implications of the LNG hub. So we'll feed this information into that process.
But of course we'll take this into the community. We've got people up in Broome who are going to you know show this report to tourism operators in Broome to demonstrate that their future is potentially being jeopardised by this project. So we're going to use it locally. We're going to use it in WA, in Perth and also nationally.
DAVID WEBER: But the Premier Colin Barnett says the government is committed to the LNG hub being placed at James Price Point.
COLIN BARNETT: Oh look obviously the Government will look at the report. But we've done our own studies as a government on the effects of this project.
Bear in mind it's 60 kilometres to the north of Broome. It is an isolated location. There are no towns, houses, villages anywhere near it. And yes it's a big complex. But it's a natural gas. It's a very clean, high-technology industry.
It won't impact on the tourism industry other than to provide a stronger economic base for a town like Broome.
DAVID WEBER: The Premier says tourism in the region is seasonal and the gas hub will provide more opportunities for the people of Broome.
COLIN BARNETT: More employment in the area, more people using the airlines, staying in the hotels, using the restaurants and the like. So I actually think it'll be a huge benefit for the tourism industry.
In my meetings with the actual tourism operators of Broome they are very enthusiastic about this. They can see it as being good for their industry.
DAVID WEBER: It was thought that state cabinet would this week be discussing the option of compulsory acquisition of the land at James Price Point. The Premier has previously said he's prepared to use legislation if the traditional owners can't reach agreement on whether they want the gas hub. Mr Barnett says a final decision is yet to be made but he says patience is running out.
MARK COLVIN: David Weber.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,3,"A GAS terminal planned for Australia's north-west coast is not compatible with tourism in the Kimberley and would damage the region's international appeal, a Curtin University report says.
The report found the world's largest humpback whale breeding sanctuary would be seriously disturbed by Woodside Petroleum's proposed liquefied natural gas port near Broome. It said the dollar benefit of the whale-watching industry outweighed the financial and employment gains from the development.
  Oil and gas development would have significant detrimental social, environmental and economic impacts,  the report said. The 10 tourism operators around Broome that account for 35 per cent of its economic activity would be  severely damaged .
The West Australian government has been pushing for the establishment of a big gas terminal in Broome, which would be built by Woodside Petroleum, in partnership with BHP Billiton, BP, Shell and Chevron.
The controversial proposal, yet to be approved by the federal government, would allow at least $30 billion worth of liquefied natural gas from the Browse Basin to be processed in Australia before being shipped mostly overseas.
Woodside Petroleum said its gas port would  add to the diversity and strength of the Kimberley economy .
Other possible sites for the gas hub, including an already industrialised site in the Pilbara, or an offshore plant, could not compete with Broome on cost or environmental grounds, the company said.
 Woodside is about to embark on its own social impact assessment as part of its ongoing approvals process,  a spokesman said.
A report last year by the finance consultants JPMorgan found that areas other than the whale-breeding zone would also be suitable for the gas hub.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The premier state is coming a very distant second to its northernÂ neighbour when it comes to developing the state's ampleÂ reserves of coal seam gas, writes Paul Garvey.
NSW is missing out on potentially billions of dollars of investment and thousands of new jobs through its failure to embrace the state's coal seam gas potential, executives have warned.
 While the rapid emergence of CSG developments in Queensland has that state eyeing more than $50 billion in new investment in the coming years, NSW's CSG industry remains in its infancy.
NSW's geology is considered to be as prospective for CSG as Queensland's, but companies active in NSW say problems with the state's approvals processes and a lack of government support have left them in Queensland's wake.
Complaints include poor experiences with regulators, inordinate delays for permit approvals, poor technical understanding of the sector within key agencies, and a lack of incentives to encourage development.
Glenda McLoughlin, the chief financial officer of NSW coal seam gas play Metgasco, which has endured a two-year wait on a vital production licence, says the political turmoil in NSW is a major cause of the lack of CSG development.
 Unfortunately in NSW, the government at a political level has been very unstable,  McLoughlin says.  Whereas a stable government could have been more proactive in terms of building up the departmental capability, there's been very little attention given to this emerging industry. 
Metgasco's wait would not have occurred had the project been in Queensland, as licences there allow for gas discovered to be immediately sold into markets without additional approvals.
The company has been forced to burn off its gas while it waits for the permit upgrade.
 We're not allowed to do anything with it. We've got customers about a kilometre away who want to buy the gas but we cannot get that production lease out of the department,  McLoughlin says.
The contrast between states is particularly stark for those such as AGL Energy managing director Michael Fraser and former Arrow Energy chief Shaun Scott, who have been involved in CSG in Queensland and NSW.
After selling out its stake in CSG pioneer Queensland Gas Co for a big profit in 2008, AGL has turned its attentions to the NSW CSG industry.
It acquired Sydney Gas in late 2008 and has been working to prove up a reserve base.
Fraser admits that progress in NSW has been slow compared to that made in Queensland.
 Let's face it, the industry is relatively new in NSW compared to Queensland,  he says.
 But we think there are some improvements which can be made in NSW that would streamline the process but at the same time provide the appropriate protection for the environment and for land holders. 
To date, he says, AGL has been getting a hearing from the government about the improvements that could be made, although action is another thing.
Scott's new entity, Dart Energy, has its foot on a CSG joint venture in NSW.
 The resources potential in NSW is pretty good, but from a development perspective it is really difficult,  Scott says.
 The regulatory environment is more complicated and certainly the time frames to get things approved are longer. 
The apparent lack of support is all the more confusing, Scott says, because of the obvious benefits to be seen north of the border in Queensland.
 You only need to look at the momentum that's happened in Queensland around CSG to see what coal seam gas can do,  Scott says.  Even if it's only a small part of that can happen in NSW, it's got to be a positive. 
Santos chief executive David Knox says his company has been able to work effectively within NSW, although he notes that operating in the state is not without its hurdles.
 One of the challenges in the (NSW) Gunnedah Basin is it is quality farmland,  Knox says.
 We have to respond very carefully to the responses of the community, but to date we've been able to execute the program we've wanted to execute. 
Eastern Star Gas, one of the largest holders of CSG acreage in NSW, has endured a frustrating experience with its growth plans.
The company has been aiming to progress plans for a CSG-fed liquefied natural gas facility at Newcastle, a potential milestone project for the state.
It was the prospect of exporting CSG as LNG which put Queensland's then fledgling industry on the map, triggering more than $20 billion in acquisitions in the sector by some of the international oil and gas industry's biggest names.
While Eastern Star has outlined to the NSW government modelling of the economic benefits an LNG plant at Newcastle would bring to the state, it is yet to release the projections publicly.
But if the project is even a fraction of the size of the projects proposed for development in Queensland, the investment is likely to be worth several billion dollars and directly generate thousands of jobs.
Last November, the company put in a request for the development to receive  significant  project status from the government, a recognition that would provide a defined path through the required approvals processes.
Some 10 months later, Eastern Star is still waiting.
In contrast, Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips lodged their request for significant project status for their Australia Pacific LNG development on March 27 2009, and the project was confirmed as significant some 3Â½ weeks later.
BG Group and Royal Dutch Shell both had to wait a month for their respective Queensland LNG projects to receive significant status.
Eastern Star chief executive David Casey acknowledges that NSW is still well behind Queensland when it comes to CSG but says he is hopeful that this will change in time.
 There's no doubt the CSG industry represents a significant opportunity to the state of NSW, not only from a revenue perspective as far as royalties are concerned, but also jobs growth and industrial developments around CSG for power and, in our case, LNG potentially out of Newcastle,  Casey says.
 Our government departments are getting up to speed, but I think it's also fair to say compared to Queensland there's a bit of a ways to go. 
The companies say there's no co-ordination between the various government agencies dealing with the sector. Although the agencies have a long history of dealing with the coal mining industry they don't understand the coal seam gas sector.
Beyond the slow approvals process, there is consternation about the lack of public support from the government itself.
While the Queensland government from Premier Anna Bligh down were prepared to speak out against the federal government's resource super profits tax and its potential impact on the state's CSG companies, there were no similar statements during the debate from anyone within the NSW government.
NSW Mineral and Forestry Resources Minister Paul McLeay defends his government's record on CSG.
While he says he recognises the potential of the sector, he insists he will not allow  an open slather approach  to the approvals process.
 We have a pretty rigorous planning process that we're pretty proud of,  McLeay says.
 We think it's pretty transparent and quite hardy as well. 
The royalty exemption applied to CSG extracted from operating coal mines is an example of the state's support for the industry, he says, as is the sector's ability to access a recently established, multi-mineral geological database.
He points to the estimated $120 million in 2011 exploration spending commitments from two of the state's biggest CSG explorers, Santos and AGL Energy, as evidence that the state is attracting investment. That's up from $76 million in financial 2009 and around $100 million in 2010.
 That's pretty steadily climbing growth in what is a new industry,  McLeay said.
 Over $300 million in three years is a strong sign of commitment. 
Meanwhile, Queensland's CSG players are gearing up for their own strong signs of commitment.
In addition to its NSW exploration, Santos and its partner Petronas are likely to approve in the coming months an estimated $16.4Â billion investment in the Gladstone LNG project.
BG is similarly poised to approve its $20.1Â billion QCLNG project, while a final investment decision on Origin and ConocoPhillips' $17.1 billion APLNG is scheduled to occur soon after.
There are various theories within the CSG sector as to why NSW continues to trail Queensland so badly.
Shaun Scott believes Queensland managed to get the jump on NSW by mandating that 15 per cent of the state's electricity must come from gas-fired power plants.
This policy has not only helped reduce the state's dependence on emissions-intensive coal-fired plants, he says. It has also helped create a key market for the CSG players in the state â€“ enabling them to demonstrate that their projects work and could be run consistently and economically.
Others believe the problem firmly stems from the NSW government down. The extraordinary turnover of premiers and ministers in the state, and the persistent proverbial spot-fires facing the industry, mean the government simply hasn't had the consistency or ability to embrace and develop the CSG sector.
 This government is not the most efficient government running around,  says one CSG executive who does not want to be named.
 My view is they've got other challenges occupying their time. It's not that they've put it in the too hard basket, they just don't have time to get their head around it.
 The issue I see is that they're distracted. 
Metgasco's McLoughlin believes a predilection towards coal mining, and the lack of any experience with the petroleum industry, has contributed to the slow evolution of the state's CSG sector.
 Unfortunately in NSW there hasn't been a petroleum industry, so the regulatory role has fallen to a department that's very familiar with regulating the coal industry, but which isn't very experienced with petroleum,  McLoughlin says.
NSW opposition shadow treasurer Mike Baird is scathing about the government's handling of the CSG sector.
Baird describes CSG as  a stand-out opportunity  for the state's economic development, but one that has been  effectively ignored .
 It is another perfect example of where apathy, lack of focus and lack of urgency leaves NSW last on pretty much every economic indicator,  he says.
 We see coal seam methane as an exponential opportunity for the state. Instead, we're moving at a snail's pace. 
Baird is yet to commit to any firm decisions on how CSG would be handled under a NSW Liberal government, but says the opposition is open to consultation with industry over the best methods of speeding up development in the sector.
While the gas in NSW's coal seams is going nowhere, the companies fear that they could miss out on opportunities presented by growing markets in Asia.
For companies like Eastern Star which hope one day to export the gas as LNG, there is a very real global race to bring LNG projects into being before the demand is fully absorbed.
 If you react too late, the train leaves the station,  Baird says.  If you look at what's happening in Queensland with LNG and the huge investment there, I still believe we're in a position to play a significant role. But it's not going to be too long before that's missed.
 There's a huge opportunity staring them in the face, and not surprisingly, rather than looking to develop the economy, they're spending too much time looking at themselves. 
McLeay, meanwhile, admits there is still room for the government to improve its handling of the sector.
 There's always room for improvement,  he says.  It's a new industry and we want to ensure they can all fit in together.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"CSG BRISBANE, Sept 1 AAP - The Queensland government has set up a new online portal to allay community concerns about the impact of coal seam gas (CSG) projects on groundwater.
The portal will provide the latest information on groundwater monitoring in the Surat and Bowen basins.
 The announcement follows a groundwater scare earlier this year centred on a different kind of resource project - Cougar Energy's pilot underground coal gasification plant near Kingaroy.
Natural Resources, Mines and Energy Minister Stephen Robertson said the new interactive portal was about providing greater transparency.
It contains maps locating private water bores and springs, gas production sites and exploration wells.
It also maps springs and baseflow-fed watercourses, and details historical water levels and salinity records from the four major CSG explorers and producers in the Surat and Bowen basins - Santos, Origin Energy, Queensland Gas Company and Arrow Energy.
Water levels and salinity records from selected monitoring bores operated by the Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) are also available.
Mr Robertson said the government had increased its monitoring of the coal seam gas industry.
He said the department would sample about 300 bores in 2011 and 2012 to check the accuracy of information provided by CSG operators.
 This is another initiative to support the government's ongoing commitment to manage groundwater impacts and allow the public to access important and relevant information on CSG activities,  he said in a statement.
 It reaffirms the government's commitment to openness and transparency for the industry. 
He said DERM would also commit additional resources to investigate environmental complaints received from the public and alleged or apparent non-compliance by CSG companies.
Those who failed to comply would be issued with penalty infringement notices and ultimately prosecuted, he said.
The portal has been set up in partnership with CSG companies.
The move comes after traces of the toxic chemicals benzene and toluene were found in groundwater at the Cougar Energy underground coal gasification trial site and a neighbouring property near Kingaroy earlier this year.
The discovery prompted a ban on farmers using the water and selling cattle who drank it, and accusations from locals that they'd repeatedly warned the government of the groundwater risks.
The ban has since been lifted after fresh tests showed the water was safe.
But the company's trials remain suspended, with a meeting scheduled for this week between the company and government over environmental issues.

The short term trading market (STTM) is an important part of helping to ensure the reliable and efficient provision of gas to South Australia, the state's Energy Minister Patrick Conlon says.
 Short-term trading between market participants provides greater flexibility to respond to changes in supply and demand, which in turn improves reliability of supply, he said in a statement on Wednesday.
 The STTM is also expected to improve gas trading by introducing greater transparency of terms, prices and quantities, as well as more real time information on the state of the gas market,  he said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"COUGAR MELBOURNE, Sept 1 AAP - The energy company at the centre of a water contamination scare in Queensland has told the stock exchange it is uncertain whether it can continue as a going concern.
Cougar Energy said, in its annual results released on Tuesday, that the uncertainty remained unless the the Queensland government lifts an Environmental Protection Order which has stopped work at the site, a pilot plant extracting coal seam gas.
 Cougar Energy Ltd made headlines in July after its trial underground coal gasification (UCG) project near Kingaroy was forced to close after company tests found traces of the carcinogen benzene and the toxic chemical toluene in bores at the site.
After trade ended on Tuesday, Cougar revealed it may not be able to continue.
 The company's forecast working capital requirements for the next 12 months exceeds the company's current cash position,  Cougar said in its full year results.
 This indicates a material uncertainty that may cast doubt over the company's ability to continue as a going concern, unless additional capital can be raised,  it said.
Elsewhere in the results, Cougar said,  The ability of the consolidated entity to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising new capital on an on-going basis and the Environmental Order being lifted .
 Should (Cougar) be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be required to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business, and at amounts that differ from those stated in this financial report. 
Already, the company has sacked most of its staff at its Kingaroy operations and in its Melbourne and Brisbane offices.
Cougar's shares have been in a trading halt since July 16, as it tries to negotiate financing.
In 2009/10, Cougar said it made a loss of $4.1 million, steeper than the $2.9 million loss in the previous 12 months.
Company revenue was down 1.9 per cent at $393,043.
The value of the troubled Kingaroy project will be written down by $26.7 million if the company is not able to proceed with it, Cougar told the stock exchange.
In the past Cougar has expressed disappointment the environmental order has not been lifted, despite follow-up testing showing bores around the project are safe.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"CSG By Paul Osborne
BRISBANE, Sept 2 AAP - A study has found Queensland's largest freshwater aquifer is at serious risk of being drained as a direct result of coal seam gas (CSG) extraction.
 The Condamine Alluvium, which extends 3,600 square kilometres from Ellangowan to Macalister, north of Dalby, is the main source of fresh water for Dalby, Pittsworth, Millmerran and Macalister and the surrounding farming region.
A report by independent hydrogeologist John Hillier said the aquifer was hydraulically connected to the Walloon coal measures, which the Queensland government is allowing to be dewatered for coal seam gas production.
The Walloon coal measures are a key supply source for CSG, which at least eight major players plan to turn into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export.
The government has estimated the market for the LNG the could reach about 43 million tonnes a year.
Members of farm industry group Central Downs Irrigators, who commissioned the report, are concerned about the impacts of CSG development.
Mr Hillier found in his report that water would move from the Condamine Alluvium as water level in the Walloon coal measures dropped as a result of the CSG development.
 Because of the very real likelihood of movement of groundwater from the alluvium to the coal measures, more data is required to allow the calculation of the volumes that could be involved,  he said in the report.
The Central Downs Irrigators have called for a moratorium on CSG development in the area, until more work can be done on the environmental impact.
Spokesman Johannes Roellgen said irrigators had already seen big cuts in their water allocations in recent years and had cooperated with the government.
 But any risk of allowing the alluvium to be drained from the bottom by mining activities is unsustainable and unjust,  he said in a statement.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"BROWSE SYDNEY, Sept 2 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd says its Browse liquified natural gas (LNG) development is on track to complete a $1.25 billion work program by mid-2012.
The work program must be ready to allow the Browse joint venture partners to make a final investment decision on the project.
 A statement by Woodside on the work program on Thursday followed a Western Australian government decision to begin the process of compulsory acquisition of land for the gas precinct in the Kimberley region, in the north of WA.
After weeks of threatening compulsory acquisition for the $30 billion Woodside Petroleum-led project, WA Premier Colin Barnett announced the government's intention to proceed.
Woodside said the compulsory acquisition maintained the opportunity for a negotiated outcome to be secured with the traditional owners.
At the same time, it would provide a greater degree of certainty for the development, Woodside said in a statement.
 We remain committed to delivering the benefits we have promised during our discussions with the Kimberley Land Council and Native Title claimants,  Perth-based Woodside said.
The initiatives included in the project, which Woodside said were worth  in excess of $1 billion over the life of the development , were among the most substantial made by a development to support indigenous people.
The Kimberley Land Council (KLC) had wanted to continue negotiations for an indigenous land use agreement for the land at James Price Point, north of Broome.
Woodside's Browse joint venture partners are BHP Billiton Ltd, BP, Chevron and Shell.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"The Western Australian Government has confirmed it's starting the process of compulsory acquisition to take over land on the Kimberley coast for a $30 billion natural gas development.
The decision to acquire land just north of Broome has already been criticised by local Indigenous academic Mick Dodson, who says it's theft.
 But Premier Colin Barnett is standing by his decision.
 As Premier, I have a responsibility to ensure that major investment projects, such as liquefied natural gas, are not lost to this state,  he says.
 I also have a responsibility to the people of the area, and particularly the Aboriginal people, that a project like this offers them a real opportunity of economic independence. 
The site at James Price Point lies 60 kilometres north of Broome.
The compulsory acquisition will involve six months negotiation with potential native title claimants, which could be referred to the courts.
In April last year, a heads of agreement was signed between the government, the Kimberley Land Council and the developer, Woodside.
Since then, negotiations between the parties have broken down, but Mr Barnett says talks will continue to try to get an agreement by consent.
Mr Barnett says he had no choice but to act.
 I can honestly say, in terms of the negotiation and I can look myself in the mirror with a clear conscience, I could not have tried harder, I don't think the leaders of the KLC could have tried harder, I don't believe the Department of State Development and other agencies could have done more,  he says.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,3,"State Government information meetings hit mark for landowners
The response to State Government Community Coal Seam Gas forums has been very positive with meetings being held throughout the region during the past week.
 A party of 12 State Government delegates lead by head of department John Bradley visited Wandoan last Thursday to meet with a large crowd of concerned Wandoan landholders and business owners.
Wandoan Clean Food Alliance member Pat Devlin was at the meeting and commended the group on a job well done.
â€œWe are feeling like someone's listening now and willing to discuss positive moves,â€? he said.
â€œIt was an extremely good forum and congratulations to the people who put it on.
â€œIt's about time; I congratulate minister Stephen Robertson of having the initiative to take the forums to the bush.â€?
Mr Devlin has a 650 hectare cattle and grain property located on the southern side of Xstrata Coals mining lease near Wandoan.
He has four QGC, CSG wells on his property and has also been on Xstrata Coal's radar.
He said issues discussed at the forum including managing the environment and water were of particular interest.
Loss of underground water and lack of understanding surrounding the topic and its ramifications is a major concern.
â€œWe've had quite a good run with the gas exploration but we're now concerned about the next phase.â€?
Other topics discussed at the forum included strategic cropping land, land access and compensation and compliance and monitoring.
Mr Devlin said while not all the questions could be answered, community members now knew where to turn for information.
â€œWe were given contacts with the various departments, which was something we haven't had before.â€?
Meanwhile, Basin Sustainability Alliance chairman Ian Hayllor attended a forum held in Dalby this week.
He said he was pleased with the developments the government has made on a number of key issues.
â€œThe premier and ministers obviously listened to the concerns raised about CSG activity at the Roma community cabinet and have made considerable effort to address them,â€? he said.
â€œI urge any concerned landholders or community members to take this opportunity and attend one of these meetings.
â€œThe format is very good, not too technical and gives people plenty of opportunity to ask the questions and talk individually to representatives from the government departments.â€?
Chinchilla residents will have their chance to attend with an information forum being held at the Chinchilla Cultural Centre next Thursday from 10.30am â€“ 2pm.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE State Government has been pushed out of its depth and has allowed the coal seam gas industry to develop beyond its ability to cope, say farmers.
The Queensland Farmers Federation congratulated the Government on its recent draft policy to save strategic cropping land but said it did nothing to address the potential risk to underground water or the state's huge grazing industry.
 The federation told its members this week the potential 40,000 gas wells that would be developed by coal seam gas could have ``highly alienating impacts'' on the state's farming industry.
It said property values and the potential impact on underground water were of concern, alongside the sheer frustration of farmers as they attempted to navigate their machinery around a patchwork of gas wells.
``This potentially will lead to an insidious and eventual alienation of cropping land and the farm sector that, if not balanced in the future, could be as devastating as an open-cut coal mine.''
QFF chief executive Dan Galligan said the nub of the issue was that the gas market, gas policy and climate-change policy had driven development beyond what was known and it was now a game of catch-up.
He said approvals were given for projects before there was any real understanding of the impacts on underground water.
``The Government has at least recognised they want to protect farming land from mining. The hard thing is a lot of the pressure on farms is coming from coal seam gas development. I don't think it (the draft policy) will solve a lot of the problems,'' Mr Galligan said.
``In our dealings with Government they are working bloody hard to catch up on the developments that have been approved beyond their understanding of what is acceptable risk. What we say is the community wants greater surety and regulations are going to have to be applied retrospectively, whether they like it or not,'' he said.
``The community needs to have a better say in this. They have been locked out of this, as have farmers.
``The state has handed over a right for royalties, and people at a community level never really know about it until it's too late.''
While the Government has been under fire for the gaps in the draft cropping land policy, it has also let it be known that it is only now trying to grapple with new regulations to protect underground water.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"`If the regions want infrastructure they are going to have to fight long and hard for it'
QUEENSLAND'S regional councils are crazy if they think they deserve $750 million in royalties from the coal seam gas industry.
 Sure, they deserve something. They deserve improved roads because the trucks are rumbling up and down their highways every day at a massive rate delivering pipelines and other equipment to areas from the Surat Basin to Gladstone.
They deserve traffic improvements and jobs to go to the regions and skills training to allow that.
They desperately deserve a massive upgrading of the appalling Warrego Highway, which resembles one of the giant wave-like slippery dip rides at the Ekka. They need hospitals and bridges and schools and rail line and ports.
There are lots of things they deserve, but setting aside a set amount each year of the almost $800 million in royalties the state will receive from CSG - as proposed by the Local Government Association of Queensland at its annual conference this week - is small-thinking.
It is the same sort of thinking that inspired the suggestion that the state should split in two - a move which would inevitably lead to the economic death of North Queensland and its transition into something of a basket case economy, totally reliant on the cycles of industries that have never been totally stable. It is the same sort of thinking that saw West Australian National Party MP Tony Crook, demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in tax funds for mining regions of his state.
Kalgoorlie does not own the gold under its soil. Likewise, the Surat Basin does not own the gas and Mount Isa doesn't own the copper, zinc or lead. None of these places deserve funds just because they happen to sit on top of an economic resource.
If the cash-for-the-regions suggestion from the Local Government conference in Mackay this week were to occur, Cairns could put its hand up for a return on all the taxes paid by the tourism industry and Rockhampton can take all the taxes from sales of beef.
Mackay could take the lion's share of engineering for the mines and Brisbane could then quite rightly say well, we'll take all the stamp duty and payroll tax as well as most of the money from GST.
The RACQ waves this flag too. It wants funds raised from motorists to go back to roads. If the world were perfect that's what would happen and we'd all have dual lane carriageways to our driveway.
Realistically though, we are organised as a state because we have to share the wealth.
We could split into small councils and abolish the states and then watch the entire system brought to a halt by small town self-interest and rivalries.
Admittedly, that sharing of the wealth model hasn't always been too good for the regions, which have had easy gripes with state and federal governments over infrastructure they should be able to take for granted.
Mackay needs a ring road and its internet service is appalling.
Townsville needs better roads, Cairns needs anything that will broaden its economy away from tourism. The list goes on.
Cash for the regions was an area that the Rudd Government's mining tax was supposed to address. It may have worked but it would have been a grindingly slow process.
What we have, in reality, is councils saying they can't cope with the demands of population and industrial growth.
Welcome to life in the big city.
Brisbane and the Gold Coast have been trapped in that very dilemma for decades.
But that doesn't mean we should revert to short-term provincialism.
The Boulia Shire Council seemed to opt for this standard of thinking when it put a motion to the LGA annual conference for more tax rebates in remote areas to encourage people to move to the region.
The maximum rebate is just under $2000, so I wish Boulia good luck with that. I doubt tax incentives at the margins are going to be a drawcard.
At some point the Boulia Council and other remote areas are going to have to accept that economic growth cannot be based on subsidies. It has to be real and sustainable.
If the regions want infrastructure they are going to have to fight long and hard for it.

WOODSIDE'S $30 billion Browse liquefied natural gas development could be delayed by a protracted legal stoush after the West Australian government announced it had taken steps to compulsorily seize the Kimberley land for the project.
 WA Premier Colin Barnett said the land at James Price Point, 60 kilometres north of Broome, was  unallocated Crown land over which no native title has currently been determined  and needed to be acquired because the Kimberley Land Council and native-title claimants had been unable to finalise an Indigenous Land Use Agreement by the June deadline.
But traditional owners have threatened to tear up a non-binding heads of agreement signed in April by the Kimberley Land Council, the operator Woodside and the WA government, saying Kimberley Aborigines could be headed towards a  train wreck  because the social implications of the Woodside-led project had not yet been fully assessed.
KLC executive director Wayne Bergmann told BusinessDay the goodwill with which he had negotiated the agreement had gone.
 The social impact reports are not completed, a whole range of traditional owner issues have been identified which, if not addressed, mean the Kimberley Aborigines could be headed for a train wreck,  he said.  This attempted land grab could be a game changer.
 The Kimberley Land Council's ability to hold traditional landowners together was on the basis of creating responsible development and finding a balance that we could live with. 
The heads of agreement have already split the traditional owners. Aboriginal leader Joseph Roe is locked in a legal dispute with the KLC over its signing of the in-principle deal. Mr Roe, who has lodged a native-title claim over the land at James Price Point, said yesterday he would fight any compulsory acquisition legally and politically. But he did not rule out working with the KLC to fight a compulsory acquisition of the land.
Former Australian of the Year Mick Dodson said the move by the WA government was a  theft of our land  and  another invasion .
The government's acquisition of the land, however, is far from a fait accompli. First, it must  negotiate in good faith  with registered native-title claimants over six months and if an agreement is not reached await arbitration by the National Native Title Tribunal.
The federal government has conceded publicly that the legal wrangling means the timeline for the project will  probably blow out .
Woodside, which is leading a consortium that includes BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron and Shell, maintains it is on track to deliver its $1.25 billion works program by mid-2012, at which point it will make a final investment decision. It said more than $1 billion over the life of the project had been set aside to support local Aborigines.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,3,"Landholders and environmentalists calling for a moratorium on coal seam gas (CSG) activity until it can be proven the industry won't cause irreversible damage to the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) had their worst fears confirmed with the release of a report by independent hydro-geologist John Hillier.
The report, commissioned by Central Downs Irrigators Ltd (CDIL) and launched at Ag Show in Toowoomba, found that the GAB is at serious risk of being drained as a direct result of CSG production.
 Mr Hillier's findings confirmed that the Condamine Alluvium is hydraulically connected to the Walloon Coal Measures currently being dewatered for CSG production with the State Government's blessing.
Johannes Roellgen of CDIL believes that it is irresponsible to allow CSG activities to threaten the GAB especially after irrigators have sustained serious allocation cuts to ensure the longevity of the GAB which also includes the Condamine Alluvium, the primary freshwater source for Dalby, Macalister, Pittsworth and Millmerran.
â€œGroundwater irrigators have had big cuts to their allocation in recent years and have cooperated because we want the resource to be sustainable,â€? Mr Roellgen said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"Lobbyists say the party defies its own principles in trying to impose restraints
THE coal-seam gas industry has labelled the Greens' policy to seek a moratorium on CSG exploration as hypocritical, arguing that gas-fired power plants are cleaner and greener than coal-fired plants.
 The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, a lobby group for the oil and gas industry, says energy generation from the technology used would produce 70 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions.
In July, Greens leader Bob Brown called for a moratorium on multi-billion-dollar CSG exploration in Queensland and for the federal government to give more consideration to the impact on water and farmland.
The party argues that Australia requires stronger environmental laws to protect the $1.5 billion agricultural industry of Queensland's Darling Downs.
APPEA chief executive Belinda Robinson said the Greens were opposing a practical and cost-effective approach to climate change.
``I have no doubt that the Greens care deeply, as do most Australians, about the need to take action to address climate change,'' she said.
``The befuddling thing, though, is that when presented with practical, cost-effective opportunities to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they choose to oppose them.
``A more counter-intuitive policy position from the party purporting to carry the moral imperative for action on climate change is hard to imagine.''
The Greens and farmers have formed an alliance opposing CSG amid concerns that the exploration could reduce farmable land and deplete groundwater resources.
While federal laws do not explicitly cover farmland, Environment Minister Peter Garrett delayed a decision on two CSG projects until October 11 to consider new information from the companies on the impact of their projects on groundwater.
Mr Garrett has played down any prospect of the Greens adding more upfront considerations in the approval process, and it would require a further delay for senator Bob Brown to seek to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
Even then, such moves would not be supported in the upper house, given that the Coalition will oppose any legislation that threatens the CSG industry.
Mr Garrett was unable to comment yesterday.
A spokesman for the Queensland Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, said the government was not concerned that the Labor-Greens alliance would threaten CSG projects.
Irrigators, also opposed to CSG exploration, have cited a new report suggesting potential depletion of groundwater sources in the Great Artesian Basin, which is Queensland's largest freshwater aquifer.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"FARMERS are already losing as much as $80,000 a year in income from depleted groundwater resources in southern Queensland and want to stop coal-seam gas development before it gets worse.
The emerging gas industry, which intends to drill up to 40,000 gas wells in the region, will also bring underground water to the surface as part of the process and farmers fear a significant loss of water will impact on the state's best cropping land and their income.
 A report, written by independent hydro-geologist John Hillier, said the state's largest freshwater aquifer, the Condamine Alluvium, was at serious risk of being drained as a result of coal-seam gas production in the Great Artesian Basin.
The alluvium, which spreads over 3600sq km, is also the primary source of fresh water for the townships of Dalby, Pittsworth, Millmerran and Macalister.
It also is a resource for irrigators who already have cut back their annual allocation by 60 per cent to maintain the water levels.
The State Government dismissed calls for a moratorium as unnecessary and said it was pursuing research into whether treated CSG water could be used to replenish the Condamine Alluvium.
But the Hillier report found that the alluvium was connected to the coal that will be the prime source of gas for the new industry.
It found that too little was known about the alluvium and more studies were needed.
Farming group the Central Downs Irrigators said the report was proof a moratorium was needed on all further CSG development until the full environmental impacts were understood and addressed.
Farmers' spokesman Johannes Roellgen said the irrigators were committed to sustaining the alluvium and were likely to surrender up to 60 per cent of their water allocation to protect it, ``but any risk of allowing the alluvium to be drained from the bottom by mining activities is unsustainable and unjust''.
He said one irrigator would lose about $80,000 a year because of the reduced allocation which was ``a sacrifice'' for sustainability.
He said that, while there were positive reforms coming out of the State Government over the issue, the coal-seam gas industry should be stopped in areas where it affects groundwater.
Resources Minister Stephen Robertson said the report reinforced what the Government had acknowledged.
``I understand the concerns of landowners and water users in the region, and without being provocative, this report does note that ground water levels in the Condamine Alluvium have been falling for 40 years and that time frame precedes the involvement of CSG activities in the area,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"OIL and coal seam gas exploration and production company Victoria Petroleum has relocated to the heart of Brisbane.
The publicly listed company which was based in Perth, will set up its new headquarters at 144 Edward St in the city.
 Colliers International's Amanda Foggo said Victoria Petroleum had taken out a three-year lease on 307sq m of space on level 11 of the 21-floor office tower, on the corner of Charlotte and Edward streets, owned by the private property investment company Precision Group.
With industry sources indicating the building would attract a rental of mid to high $500/sq m, Victoria Petroleum is expected to pay about $170,000 a year.
Ms Foggo said Victoria Petroleum was attracted to the building because of its central location and expansion opportunities.
``Leasing activity within the CBD office market from Queensland's resource sector continues to thrive,'' she said.
Victoria Petroleum has been listed on the Australian stock exchange since 1984. Its focus is on exploration activities in the Cooper and Surat basins.
Managing director Ian Davies said the move to Brisbane reflected Victoria Petroleum's focus on its assets in the eastern states and the growing importance of the city as the headquarters for Australian resource companies.
He said the company anticipated significant growth in the new Brisbane office, which is set to accommodate a team of 20.
``This is predicated on our existing oil business in the Cooper Basin and our strong position in Queensland's coal seam gas sector,'' he said. ``Brisbane offers a thriving and vibrant base for Victoria Petroleum and the many other resource businesses that are crucial to the growth of Queensland's $40 billion liquefied natural gas industry.''

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Fears that Woodside would drop a $30 billion liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia's remote north have prompted the state government to decide to compulsorily acquire the proposed site against the wishes of traditional owners.
The decision sparked outrage from indigenous and environmental groups and the state opposition, which said the move was a  step back to the 1980s in government relations with Aboriginals .
 Premier Colin Barnett announced the decision yesterday, frustrated that a deal for an indigenous land use agreement at the Browse Basin site, 60 kilometres north of Broome, had broken down after two years of negotiations.
 As Premier I have a responsibility to ensure major investment projects are not lost to this state,  he said.
 I also have a responsibility to the people of the area, and particularly the Aboriginal people, that a project like this offers a real opportunity of economic independence, of real jobs, of real Â­opportunities. 
In April 2009, the Kimberley Land Council, representing the traditional owners, signed a heads of agreement with Woodside and the state government approving the gas project and $1.5 billion in benefits for indigenous communities over 30 years.
The land council suspended negotiations in June after Aboriginal law boss Joseph Roe challenged its right to negotiate on behalf of native title claimants.
That action is still before the court.
Mr Barnett said yesterday the Federal Court acquisition process, which could take up to 18 months, would provide certainty for Woodside and its joint venture partners â€“ Chevron, Shell, BHP Billiton and BP.
 Unless a site can be found [for Woodside and its partners], they lose a window in the [global LNG] market,  he said.
 They stressed to me in April 2009 that timing was critical and here we are over a year later and that is why I have acted. 
Mr Barnett said an agreement with traditional owners could still be reached while the acquisition process was Â­under way.
He said did not want to see a repeat of the situation where Western Australia lost a project such as Inpex's $25 billion Ichthys LNG venture to Darwin because of delays in approvals.
Kimberley Land Council chief executive Wayne Bergmann, who has accused Mr Barnett of bullying Aborigines, said:  Mr Barnett has put this project at risk because traditional owners only supported it on the basis of it being a sustainable development . . . and may now withdraw their support. 
Mr Bergmann said that Woodside and its joint venture partners faced a huge risk to their reputations if they pressed ahead without the consent of traditional Â­owners. Woodside, which expects to make a final decision on the project by mid-2012, issued a statement saying the process would bring certainty and Â­it remained committed to honouring its promised benefits to traditional Â­owners.
The state's shadow treasurer, Ben Wyatt, accused Mr Barnett of destroying goodwill between the government and traditional owners, and unravelling years of progress on negotiations between mining companies and Â­Aborigines.
Mr Barnett said the acquisition was of vacant Crown land over which native title had not yet been determined.
Labor had similarly pursued compulsory acquisition in the Ord River region in 2003.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ENERGY
ONE of the world's leading energy academics has dismissed industry concerns about the rising price of natural gas in Western Australia, claiming the resource-rich state will have decades of relatively cheap supplies.
 Detailed modelling by Peter Hartley, economics professor at Rice University's prestigious Baker Institute in the US, predicts that gas prices in WA will be lower than those on the the east coast until at least 2040.
The data also suggests that domestic gas prices in Australia, where production is forecast to soar in both WA and Queensland, will remain among the lowest in the world for the next 30 years.
The Baker Institute modelling contradicts claims by major industrial users in WA -- including Alcoa, Fortescue Metals, Newmont Mining and Alinta -- that the state is facing a shortfall of realistically priced gas.
DomGas Alliance executive director Gavin Goh said yesterday he had seen no reliable forecasts for gas prices until 2040, but he stood by assertions that prices in WA had spiked to $8-$9 compared with about $3.50 a gigajoule on the east coast.
A report commissioned by the Domgas Alliance warns WA faces a shortfall of up to 600 terajoules daily in the next decade, roughly equivalent to half of the state's current gas consumption.
The alliance also claims big energy companies are ``warehousing'' gas reserves for decades so they can export it as LNG.
In extraordinary comments this week, WA Premier Colin Barnett called on the opposing sides of the gas supply debate to keep their arguments behind closed doors.
``It causes me great distress when I have observed very public stoushes between pipeline owners and operators and gas suppliers and customers,'' he told an industry function on Thursday.
``It is not good for this state's economy if the major players in the industry are engaged in publicly brawling.''
Professor Hartley, an Australian based in the US, said his modelling showed that rising costs to produce liquefied natural gas for export from WA would lead to lower domestic prices compared with the east coast.
LNG production costs would be higher in WA compared with Queensland's emerging coal-seam gas industry because WA producers faced the added expense of carbon sequestration.
``Producing LNG in Western Australia is very, very expensive -- more expensive than anywhere else in the world,'' he said.
Professor Hartley said he expected the costs of getting LNG to market -- not the exploration and production costs, but the costs once the gas had been processed -- would be lower in Queensland than in WA.
``But the export price measured in the export markets is the same,'' he said.
``Hence, the price exporters are willing to pay for gas before they make the LNG and export it is higher on the east coast. ``So the price domestic users of gas have to pay to bid gas away from the export market is higher.
``The result is lower domestic prices in WA than in Queensland, even though gas is exported to the same end markets.''
Professor Hartley said WA's policy of reserving 15 per cent of gas reserves for domestic use led to wastage of gas and reduced investment over time.
``It tells consumers that the value of the gas is less than what it actually is and thus encourages them to waste it -- to use it for purposes that yield less benefit than the gas could be sold for,'' he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Energy giant Santos is heading off to Europe in an effort to raise fresh capital and ease the financing burden associated with its $16 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project.
Deutsche Bank and UBS are said to be hosting an investor roadshow for the Adelaide-based oil and gas company, which has been widely tipped to come to market with an equity raising in the next few months.
 Santos has been shaping up as a likely contender to raise up to $3 billion before the end of this year as a means of locking in funding for the Gladstone project, which may soon be approved.
A Santos spokesman confirmed the company would meet credit investors in Europe and that a hybrid issue was part of the company's exploration of options to fund future growth.
It is still unclear what level of hybrid funding the company is seeking. Hybrids are securities that include components of both debt and equity.
The benefit of raising some capital in hybrid form is that, unlike an equity raising, it will not dilute shareholders.
Also, a hybrid issue will earn  equity credit  in the eyes of the rating agencies and underpin the energy company's credit rating.
Santos chief executive David Knox stressed at the company's recent half-year results that a hybrid issue was among the funding options being examined.
The company is also closing in on a deal to sell at least a 15 per cent stake in GLNG to potential LNG customers, including Korea Gas and Sinopec.
The equity sale, which would form part of a long-term LNG sales agreement, would probably net Santos about $1 billion in cash as well as reduce its share of the GLNG project's capital costs.
Santos holds a 60 per cent stake in GLNG after selling 40 per cent in 2008 to Malaysian state-owned energy giant Petronas for $US2.5 billion.
The company has a liquidity position of $6.4 billion after locking in a $2 billion bank loan facility in July. It also raised $3 billion through an equity raising last year.
Santos plans to approve the development of a one-train, or processing line, LNG project at Gladstone by the end of this year.
Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett said before the election that he would only announce whether he would approve the development of GLNG in October.
A European hybrid issue from Santos would be a significant deal in the market, which has been virtually shut for two years. A â‚¬500Â million issue from Dutch firm Tennet Holdings in February ended an 18-month period of inactivity.
Santos has a rating of BBB+ so a hybrid is likely to have a BBB- rating.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts estimated on Friday that Santos would need $6 billion over the next four years to meet its commitments at GLNG.
Assuming Santos is successful in locking away the sale of the equity stake, it will need to raise another $3 billion to maintain its current credit rating.
The analysts said they were disappointed Santos was unlikely to lock in a deal to collaborate with a rival LNG project planned for the region.
Santos has said such a deal could generate $1 billion in cost savings.
 Not only would collaboration save significant capex, more importantly with the right partner it would add marketing scale, expansion flexibility and financial muscle,  the analysts said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Beach Energy plans to pump the proceeds from its Royal Dutch Shell-PetroChina bonus payment into the company's budding shale gas exploration efforts.
Shell and PetroChina had until today to hand over a $43.2 million bonus payment to Beach, following the pair's recent acquisition of coal seam gas explorer Arrow Energy.
 Under the terms of an agreement struck when Beach sold its stake in the Tipton West coal seam gas field to Arrow Energy in 2009 for $400 million, Beach is entitled to a bonus payment in the event of a change in ownership.
Shell and PetroChina's $3.5 billion acquisition of Arrow formally settled late last month, triggering a 10-day window for the Beach bonus payment to be handed over.
It fits in very neatly as Beach chief executive officer Reg Nelson said the funds from the sale would go towards the company's shale gas exploration efforts.  We move from coal seam gas to shale gas,  Mr Nelson said.  We'll have the capital to fund the shale gas program we're kicking off. 
Beach plans to spend around $60 million in the next six to nine months drilling its first two shale gas wells in South Australia's Cooper Basin, as well as a subsequent pilot well.
Beach is also entitled to eventually receive another $30 million payment from Shell and PetroChina in the event of certain milestones at Tipton West.
Beach has been talking up the potential of the Cooper Basin to host shale gas, and the company has also taken a foothold in the United States.
Improvements in drilling technologies have allowed companies in the US to exploit shale gas, which historically has been unable to flow to the surface at economic rates.
The drilling breakthroughs have prompted a surge in domestic US gas production, driving down gas prices and all but killing LNG imports into the energy-hungry nation. Supermajors such as ExxonMobil and Shell have spent tens of billions buying shale gas acreage in the past year.
Mr Nelson said that while Australian investors had been slow to catch on to the potential of shale gas, he was confident that was beginning to change.  It's getting penetration, people understand what's happening in the US,  he said.
 The question people ask is when you get the gas what will you do with it, but we're working pretty hard on that. 
Beach recently secured a memorandum of understanding with Japanese company Itochu Corporation to investigate the development of an LNG project fed by Beach's potential Cooper Basin reserves.
Mr Nelson said shale gas had the potential to become a  game changer  for Beach.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"SHELL By Rebecca Le May
PERTH, Sept 7 AAP - Royal Dutch Shell says it will look to non-traditional sources for labour for its Prelude floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off Western Australia.
 The move comes amid expectations Chevron's massive Gorgon LNG project will hog skilled workers.
The Prelude field, some 475km north-northeast of Broome, is set to be the world's first floating LNG development when it begins production in 2016.
Shell executive vice-president of Upstream Australia, Ann Pickard, says the energy giant expects to make a final investment decision to proceed with Prelude in the next few months.
Gorgon, which is 25 per cent held by Shell, is expected to start production in 2014 and create 10,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities at peak construction.
Ms Pickard told a business briefing in Perth on Tuesday that Shell would cast a wide net to find staff for the Prelude development.
 I see Roy (Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron Australia) and my good friends from Chevron were at one of our refineries the other day recruiting for Gorgon,  Ms Pickard joked during the presentation.
 Gorgon is running a couple of years ahead of us, so I think they'll get a (processing) train up and we'll get them back.
 While we're competitors, we're also colleagues ... and I think that is a really good challenge.
 We will be going into Australia to non-traditional (sources), say the mines and refining industries and the other trades, to look for operators. 
She said Shell would over the next five years send 200 people to LNG plants around the world, along with deepwater plants and marine institutions to gain the necessary skills.
Ms Pickard said Australia was poised to take the lead with new generation oil and gas developments, but it wasn't as stable a jurisdiction as perceived by some.
 The stars may have aligned for Australia,  she said.
 The gas was discovered decades ago but the combination of one, the technology and two, the market being available, have come together to provide the opportunity for Australia to move into the forefront. 
But Australia's gas renaissance may not happen if  above-ground risks  like tax regime changes scare off the industry.
Ms Pickard said Nigeria, one of Shell's prime investment destinations, tried to introduce a new tax code and lost about $100 billion worth of oil and gas investment over the past five years.
She said  above-ground risks  in WA included petroleum retention licence issues, unions and changing fiscal regimes.
However, customers would queue up for Australian gas to diversify their gas sources from the other two majors suppliers, the Middle East and Russia.
 They like to not have all their eggs in one basket. 
Ms Pickard also made an offhand comment that Shell was not preparing to take over LNG-focused Woodside Petroleum Ltd, which is 34 per cent held by the Dutch company.
 We are not getting ready to buy it again,  she said.
Shell failed to gain control of Woodside in 2001 when the Australian government blocked the move, citing national interest issues.
Recent media reports speculated that Shell and BHP Billiton Ltd were preparing a joint bid for Woodside last year.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ANNA Bligh has warned the Greens not to take a ``blinkered'' view on Queensland's nascent liquefied natural gas industry, predicting the community will not support blocking major projects unnecessarily.
The Queensland Premier and national Labor Party president said she would hate to see political manoeuvring put the brakes on the emerging resource industry for the sake of ideological rigidity, and called on all parties to take a sensible approach.
 The state's gas industry is on the cusp of major expansion, but has created a lobby of vocal enemies with an alliance of the Greens, environmental groups and primary producers calling for a moratorium on exploration.
Multinational resources giants Santos and BG Group are expecting a decision from the federal government, due by the middle of next month, before making final investment decisions on $15 billion worth of LNG projects in central Queensland.
Industry groups are concerned the Greens might wield their new power to block approvals after the pairing of the Greens and Labor in the federal House of Representatives and the Greens holding the balance of power in the Senate from next year.
Ms Bligh yesterday said she was keen to see the projects come to fruition if they met final approvals.
``As long as the Greens in Canberra take a sensible approach expecting, as the Queensland government does, all of these companies to meet strict environmental conditions, then we will be happy to see them have an interest in this,'' she said.
``If, however, they take a blinkered view, then I think we're in for a few arguments.
``If (resource companies) meet those (environmental) standards, then I would hate to see someone get in the way of a new industry, with new investment and new jobs simply because of some ideological rigidity.''
The Greens have argued there are ``huge question marks'' over gas exploration and its potential impact on the groundwater affecting arable land in southern Queensland's Darling Downs, the state's fruit bowl.
Queensland Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters pointed to a study commissioned by the Queensland Conservation Council that found greenhouse gas emissions of CSG to LNG power totalled 97 per cent of that of coal-fired plants.
``When there are these huge concerns about the impact on farmland, water and a smaller greenhouse gas profile, it's simply not worth the risk,'' she said.
Queensland Minister for Natural Resources and Energy Stephen Robertson said he was unconcerned about the Greens-Labor alliance and added that he would expect the environment minister of the day to exercise their responsibility in a transparent manner.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE gas industry is heading for a dust-up with the now-powerful Greens by challenging them to start compromising and give up their activism.
But the head of the Australia Petroleum Producers and Exploration Association Belinda Robinson said the industry could still not give any guarantee over water issues at individual coal seam gas wells in the Surat Basin and Western Downs. ``Is there a guarantee on water at every well that exists? I can't answer that,'' Ms Robinson said.
 But she said there were plenty of options for the industry to deal with the millions of litres of salty water that will come to the surface each year as part of the CSG extraction.
The Greens want a moratorium on future coal seam gas development and are planning legislation that would give the Federal Government powers to severely limit the multibillion-dollar industry.
Ms Robinson said the Greens had decided to oppose CSG in the same way they scuttled the Labor Government's climate change legislation.
She accused them of contradictory positions by demanding climate change action, yet opposing an industry that was significantly cleaner than coal.
``If they were serious about taking early and immediate action on climate change in a way that would make a significant difference to Australia and a less carbon-intensive path, they would support natural gas and work with the industry to ensure they can co-exist for material benefit.
``The challenge for them will be whether or nor they are able to set aside activism and acknowledge the potential that natural gas has to play,'' Ms Robinson said.
Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters said the plan to convert CSG to liquefied natural gas for export would be only marginally cleaner than coal as an energy source because of the massive infrastructure and energy needed.
She said there was no way the Greens could support the industry when there was still so much uncertainty and accused APPEA of scaremongering.
Ms Waters said the Greens would not use the CSG as part of any political ``horse trading'', but she was determined to introduce amendments to legislation that would include coal seam gas and strategic cropping land as triggers for intervention.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"A southern Queensland mayor says he will not let coal seam gas (CSG) companies dump salt waste on the western Darling Downs.
There are several options open to CSG companies to dump salt brine from their operations including reusing it for industrial purposes, dumping it at sea, or putting it in landfills.
 Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown says he does not want local CSG companies dumping their waste in the area.
 That is definitely not a preferred option - we will deeply oppose it,  he said.
 We already sent letter already objecting to that.
 I know it was only one of the solutions but it's certainly not an acceptable solution at all. 
He says some companies could use the waste.
 I am well aware of certain companies that wish to utilise that salt for industrial purposes for use in caustic soda and soda ash and other companies that have shown interest in it,  he said.
 We know damn well it's more expensive for the companies - that's the price you pay if you're going to do business in our region.
 The last thing is we don't want to be a dumping ground.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"News: RESOURCES
AUSTRALIA is looking to sanction an unrealistic number of liquefied natural gas projects, according to an LNG report card by Macquarie analysts that predicts only a fraction of proposed projects will go ahead.
 The Macquarie analysis is bullish on medium-term LNG demand, forecasting it to double from current levels to 372 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2020. But it sees that demand falling away after 2020, potentially threatening Australian LNG projects as development bottlenecks pose a risk to projects being delivered on time and customers look to cheaper LNG suppliers.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said the Papua New Guinea-focused Oil Search was the best investment tip of the proposed LNG producers because of its superior exposure to long-term oil prices and lower risk profile.
Mr Wood said he believed the market was overlooking the  unmatched size and quality  of Origin Energy's coal seam gas reserves destined for its Australia Pacific LNG project in Gladstone.The risks associated with Santos's neighbouring project were expected to grow over the next year, but its prime position on Curtis Island was  likely to throw up profitable opportunities in the future . Woodside's 20 mtpa net LNG production target by 2020 also looked like  a tall order , Mr Wood said, as it implied that Woodside's LNG facilities would account for 12 per cent of the global market.
 This is roughly equivalent to the combined operated oil production of ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Total and ConocoPhillips,  he said.  Deteriorating market conditions are likely to take the heaviest toll on remote, green-field projects such as Browse. 
The report found that Australia would struggle to export more than 64 mtpa of LNG by 2020 or 96 mtpa by 2030 because of tight timetables and development hurdles. The North West Shelf and Darwin LNG projects already contain 20 mtpa, with Woodside's Pluto and Chevron's Gorgon projects adding 20 mtpa by 2020. Of the remaining 24 mtpa, 17 mtpa has been tentatively secured under heads of agreement with Woodside's Wheatstone project, BG's Queensland Curtis LNG project and Santos's Gladstone LNG project.
 Of the remaining 7-10 mtpa of demand available for the new Australian LNG projects to be brought on-stream by 2020, we see proposed capacity of 135 mtpa. As a result there will be a weeding-out process with rival projects jostling for positions in the marketing and development queues, with several projects likely to be forced to produce significant qualities for the spot market,  the report found.
Mr Wood believes the market opportunity for LNG is being overstated and the graph often used by LNG sellers showing rising uncontracted demand growing over time is unrealistic.  We argue that an analysis of uncontracted demand . . . fails to capture probable contract extensions, existing heads of agreement and the expected growth in LNG spot markets,  he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ENERGY majors are too optimistic about China's long-term liquefied natural gas demand, according to Macquarie analysts, who have flagged the scenario of a well-supplied market in which Asian buyers shun Australia's higher-cost LNG production for cheaper imports and unconventional supply.
As a result, only one-sixth of the 140 million tonnes a year of yet-to-be-approved LNG capacity planned in Australia is expected to come on line in the next decade.
 Macquarie analysts, led by Adrian Wood, said Total, Woodside, Shell, BG Group and ExxonMobil had all overshot the mark with demand forecasts of between 550 and 600 million tonnes of production a year by 2030.
Macquarie is forecasting demand to be around just 400 million tonnes a year by then, up from about 200 million tonnes a year now, with most of the growth before 2020.
``LNG faces stiffer competition from alternate, and often cheaper, supply sources,'' Mr Wood said.
``Chinese long-term gas demand paints a bullish picture, however we believe the read-through for LNG may be more muted as we already see China as well supplied in the longer term.''
Chinese domestic coal-seam and shale-gas production, combined with a proposed pipeline from Russia, have the potential to add the equivalent of 100 million tonnes a year of LNG between 2020 and 2030, according to Macquarie analysts.
On the supply side, Macquarie predicts Australian LNG production will grow to 64 million tonnes a year by 2020 from 20 million tonnes a year now, well short of the 178 million tonnes it would reach if all planned projects went ahead.
With the Gorgon and Pluto LNG projects, presently under construction in Western Australia, expected to add a further 20 million tonnes of capacity, this would leave room for only 24 million tonnes of capacity out of about 140 million tonnes planned.
Mr Wood said Australia's LNG market advantage stemmed from its credentials as a reliable counterparty, rather than its lower costs or huge resources.
``In an oversupplied market, buyers may be concerned less with security of supply and instead be drawn to the lowest-cost producer, which threatens to expose Australia's higher cost base,'' he said.
Not all market watchers are as down on the outlook as Macquarie.
Credit Suisse's London-based commodities team is predicting that Australian LNG exports will grow to 110 million tonnes a year by the end of the decade, rivalling Qatar as the world's major exporter.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE Australian boss of Royal Dutch Shell has played down the potential of Queensland's rival liquefied natural gas projects merging.
There are four LNG projects on the go in Queensland, all drawing on plans to extract coal seam gas from the state's gas fields, then pipe it to Gladstone where it will be converted to liquid and exported.
 Analysts and even the backers of some projects have speculated that costs and demand will mean not all of them will proceed.
Grant King, the boss of Origin Energy (which is in joint venture with ConocoPhilips in the Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project), last month said the time had come for the four key projects to discuss merger proposals.
But Ann Pickard, the chairwoman of Shell's Australian operations, yesterday indicated that was unlikely.
She said rather than full consolidation, the most likely outcome was co-operation on some infrastructure and construction activities, such as river crossings and dredging.
``Consolidation is less needed and it may or may not happen,'' she said.
Shell and its partner PetroChina, one of China's biggest energy companies, recently completed a $3.5 billion takeover of Arrow Energy, ensuring a coal seam gas supply for their LNG project.
``I think at this point in time, what will drive consolidation is probably more the market than the actual activities (of the ventures),'' said Ms Pickard, who was in Perth for a business function. ``I don't have a driver to (merge) because I've got my LNG sold.''
Many analysts consider Origin's APLNG project lags behind its rivals because it has yet to sign a customer.
Santos boss David Knox last month said while he was interested in consolidation in the sector, it would be difficult to achieve before a final investment decision on the project.
Santos and BG Group need environmental approval by the new Federal Government on their projects, before making final investment decisions.
Environment Minister Peter Garrett has given BG and Santos until early October to submit revised environmental impact statements.
An evaluation of the proposals by Queensland's Co-ordinator-General Colin Jensen found gaping holes in the companies' plans to manage risks, including potential damage to groundwater resources which regional communities and industries rely on.
The Greens Party has urged Mr Garrett to use his powers to halt the projects until CSG companies can prove there is no risk of groundwater contamination or depletion.
Santos shares fell after Independent MPs Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor announced their support for Labor but later edged higher to close up 4 at $13.83. Origin Energy shares slipped 1c to close at $15.55.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The rapidly shrinking opportunity for new Australian liquefied natural gas projects has been brought home by the latest findings from Macquarie, which reckons only a fraction of the crowd of hopefuls will go ahead.
The broker bullishly estimates 6.6 per cent annual growth in LNG demand over the next decade. But Asia will only absorb about 24 million tonnes a year of new Australian capacity in addition to the 20 million tonnes already under construction. While LNG sales accords have been secured for 17 million tonnes more of capacity, that still leaves many projects high and dry.
 Global majors should be best placed to grow in LNG at the expense of their local peers, Macquarie said, a view echoed yesterday by Shell's new Australian chair Ann Pickard, who insisted Shell was having no trouble selling its LNG into the  great market . Meanwhile, as Pickard put the dampeners on speculation Shell may revive its bid for control of Woodside, the action was in the junior end of the market, with Cooper Basin players Drillsearch and Innamincka Petroleum calling trading halts pending a deal. No clues were forthcoming yesterday from Drillsearch CEO Brad Lingo, who pulled out of his address to the Good Oil conference in Fremantle, but a friendly merger between the two is set to be announced today, involving a share and asset swap. Former Innamincka MD Ross Wecker joined Drillsearch's board last year, tightening the companies' ties.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The new head of Royal Dutch Shell's Australian operations has hosed down the likelihood of consolidating the company's Queensland coal seam gas assets with others in the state.
Ann Pickard, who replaced Russell Caplan as chairman of Shell's Australian arm earlier this year, said in Perth yesterday that she did not believe consolidation was required.
 Shell and Santos have previously been in advanced talks to combine their Queensland assets into Santos' Gladstone LNG project, allowing for the development of a larger, economically stronger project.
Santos chief executive David Knox last month played down the prospects of a deal, saying any breakthrough on consolidation was unlikely to be announced before it made its end of year final investment decision on the $16 billion GLNG project.
Ms Pickard said she was more focused on co-operating with the rival LNG developments, rather than striking deals to consolidate projects.
She said Shell was in discussions with all three other LNG projects â€“ BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG project, Origin Energy and ConocoÂ­Phillips' Australia Pacific LNG venture, and Santos and Petronas' GLNG â€“ about issues such as river crossings and dredging.
 My predecessor Russell Caplan was very clear that he felt consolidation should occur. But at this point in time, what I think will drive consolidation is the market rather than the actual activities. 
The Queensland government has expressed its preference to see the number of proposed LNG projects consolidated, while analysts have long tipped it as all but certain.
Origin Energy chief executive Grant King last month said that the  time was now  for LNG project consolidation.
Ms Pickard said that as its partner in the recent $3.5 billion takeover of Queensland coal seam gas company Arrow Energy, Chinese state-owned giant PetroChina, had agreed to buy LNG from the pair's proposed Queensland project, there was less incentive for Shell to pursue consolidation.
 I don't have a driver to do it because I've got my LNG sold,  she said.  Co-operation is really important I think, and that's where my focus is, to make sure Arrow's doing everything they can to co-operate with the other players. 
Ms Pickard refused to be drawn on her thoughts on the merits of the Woodside Energy-operated Browse LNG project in Western Australia, in which Shell is a minority partner alongside BHP Billiton, BP and Chevron.
The WA government last week announced it would compulsorily acquire land at James Price Point north of Broome as a site for the Browse LNG facility, sparking outrage from some indigenous groups.
The minority partners in Browse, including Shell, had previously expressed their preference for gas from Browse to be piped 1000 kilometres south for processing through the existing North-West Shelf LNG facilities, but Woodside last year won government support for its plans for the stand-alone LNG project.
Asked if she supported the compulsory acquisition plans, Ms Pickard said she would  see what happens .  We're in the process of doing all the economics, the analysis, and everything that has to go with that,  she said.
She painted a bright picture of the LNG market, saying Shell expected LNG demand from China to grow from 10 million tonnes to 46Â million tonnes this year.
 Places like Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Pakistan, all kinds of new terminals are opening up. It's a really great market right now,  Ms Pickard said.
 We're not having any troubles selling our LNG. 
Ms Pickard joked during her address to a breakfast function yesterday morning that the company had no immediate plans to revisit its takeover of Woodside, but when asked by the media to repeat her statement after the event said she would not comment on market speculation.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"SANTOS PERTH, Sept 9 AAP - French energy giant Total has emerged with a 20 per cent stake in the $7.7 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project (GLNG) after 60/40 joint venture partners Santos Ltd and Malaysia's Petronas sold down part of their stakes.
Santos, which agreed to sell a 15 per cent stake for $650 million, said this was the first major investment by Total in an LNG project using unconventional gas - in this case coal seam gas.
 Santos managing director David Knox the deal with Total was a landmark agreement for the Australian LNG industry.
 We are pleased to welcome Total into the GLNG project as a fully integrated joint venture partner,  Mr Knox said in a statement on Thursday.
Total is one of the world's largest LNG producers with interests in eight producing LNG projects and one under construction.
It also has an interest in the Inpex-led Icthys LNG project in Western Australia's Browse Basin.
State-owned oil company Petronas said it had entered into an agreement to sell a five per cent interest in the GLNG project to Total, which is the world's fourth largest listed natural gas producer.
Santos, which previously held 60 per cent of GLNG (and Petronas 40 per cent) on Thursday also flagged further deals related to the project with Asian parties.
Upon completion of the latest transactions, Santos will have a 45 per cent stake in GLNG and Petronas will hold 35 per cent.
Santos said it would explore potential further cooperation with Total in respect to commercialising Santos' significant contingent resources in Australia.
Proceeds from the project equity sale to Total will be used to fund Santos' pipeline of growth projects and general corporate purposes including funding the company's share of GLNG project costs, Santos said.
Santos had previously said it planned to sell down nine per cent of GLNG as it needed more funds to allow it to participate in the development of GLNG and the $US15 billion ($A16.36 billion) Papua New Guinea LNG joint venture, which is 13.5 per cent held by Santos.
Santos said that the GLNG joint venture remained  in detailed ongoing discussions with a number of Asian parties in relation to further potential LNG sales and equity in the project .
 These parties include KOGAS (Korea Gas), the world's largest LNG buyer,  Santos said.
Media reports previously speculated that Korea Gas, Royal Dutch Shell and China's Sinopec were interested in buying a stake in GLNG.
Santos said the GLNG joint venture had also signed a binding agreement to sell 1.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG to Total for a period of 20 years starting in 2014.
GLNG and Petronas had increased contracted sales volumes to 3.5 Mtpa under a previously announced binding agreement whereby Petronas agreed to buy 2Mtpa and had an option to buy a further 1Mtpa.
Combined, the offtake deals with Total and Petronas provide for the sale of 5Mtpa of LNG from the Gladstone project worth more than $100 billion, underpinning the development of a two processing `train' project, Santos said.
Total chairman Christophe de Margerie said the French firm was teaming up with Santos for its expertise in gas production in Australia and with Petronas for its experience in marketing LNG in Asia.
 Total will bring to the project its experience in successfully managing major projects such as the construction of gas liquefaction plants, and its capacity to market LNG to the Asian market,  he said.
The equity sale agreement is subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approval and other approvals.
Santos shares had fallen 76 cents, or 5.53 per cent, to $12.99 by 1329 AEST.

BRISBANE, Sept 9 AAP - Santos Ltd chief executive David Knox says the energy giant will work with the federal government to get the environmental nod for its coal seam gas (CSG) projects next month.
 CSG projects have come under intense scrutiny from the federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett as well as farmers and conservationists, who say CSG production - where water is pumped to the surface, freeing the CSG trapped in rocks below - will endanger the Great Artesian Basin and pollute the surface.
Mr Knox was in Brisbane on Thursday to announce an $860 million deal between Santos and its Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project joint venture partner Petronas with French oil and gas conglomerate Total.
He also announced associated LNG sales deals worth several billion dollars.
Mr Knox said progress was being made on the environmental impact statement (EIS), which addressed salinity concerns.
 I would not acknowledge that this (salinity) is a problem - the issue here is to make sure that we manage our operations right the way throughout Queensland,  he told reporters.
 The EIS went to the federal government some months ago and that's been moving forward and is on schedule to be completed by October.
 We don't expect any difficulties with it but we will work with the minister once he or she is appointed. 
Deputy Queensland Premier Paul Lucas said the state government would make sure there was minimal impact upon the environment.
He said the EIS, which was signed off by the state government months ago, was now in the federal government's hands.
 We saw them (federal government) knock off Traveston Dam in the past for their own reasons and we weren't absolutely thrilled to bits about that,  he told reporters at the announcement.
 We hope to receive a favourable decision from the government on this. 
He said the industry would keep people in jobs in rural areas and brushed off the questions of salinity as a result of mining, saying regulations would ensure water quality met guidelines.
 If we want to provide a future for people in rural Australia ... we can do it in an environmentally responsible way,  Mr Lucas said.
Mr Lucas said the gas deal announced on Thursday by Santos would reap $3 billion in royalties over the life of the project, or $120 million per year while creating 6000 jobs.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,3,"Central Downs Irrigators Limited last week released a report that has reinforced there is not enough information regarding the impacts the coal seam gas industry has on groundwater.
Titled Groundwater connections between the Walloon coal measures and the Alluvium of the Condamine River, the report points out that insufficient data exists to quantify the extend to which freshwater could flow between the Walloon cal measures and the Condamine alluvium.
 This has reinforced concerns local landowners through the region already have.
State Government Natural Resources minister Stephen Robertson said the government would treat the report very seriously, but would not prejudge the extent of connections between the Walloon coal measure and Condamine alluvium.
â€œI understand the concerns of landowners and water users in the region, and without being provocative, this report does note that ground water levels in the Condamine alluvium have been gradually falling for 40 years,â€? he said.
â€œThis time frame precedes the involvement of CSG activities in the area.â€?
Mr Robertson also said a moratorium on CSG exploration, as suggested by some landowners, was not necessary.
â€œTo a large extent a moratorium is already in place through the heavily-conditioned approval process placed on CSG exploration and development through the independent co-ordinator general.
â€œTo have their operations approved, companies have to respond to around 1200 conditions placed on them by the co-ordinator general through the Environmental Impact Statement process.
â€œMost of these conditions go to the very concerns the landowners have expressed about the intersection of CSG operations with nearby or connected aquifers.
Mr Robertson said the bottom line was that until these companies meet these fundamental conditions, they could not proceed with their operations.
Meanwhile, Mr Robertson said the government was also actively pursuing research into whether treated CSG water could be used in a way which replenished the Condamine alluvium.
â€œThere are several feasibility studies being considered regarding options for treating and secondary use of CSG water.â€?

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"SANTOS says it will ``work constructively'' with the new Federal Government that includes key Independents and the Greens who have voiced concern over the farming and environmental impacts from mining.
Santos and BG Group unit Queensland Gas Co expect Environment Minister Peter Garrett to decide early next month whether to clear their multibillion-dollar projects to extract coal seam gas from the Darling Downs and pipe it to Gladstone for processing into LNG.
 Mr Garrett asked for further information on their plans to manage risks such as contaminating the groundwater resources that rural towns and industries rely on.
The Greens have urged Mr Garrett to halt the projects until CSG companies can prove there is no risk of groundwater damage.
Santos is also exploring for CSG in the Liverpool Plains farming region in the electorate of New England MP Tony Windsor.
Mr Windsor, now part of the Labor-led federal alliance, has raised concerns about potential groundwater risks from mining activities and in June he called then prime minister Kevin Rudd's attention to Shenhua Coal's
``disregard for the impact of mining on groundwater resources'' throughout the Liverpool Plains.
State laws control land-use decisions, such as mining, but federal environmental laws require the government to protect ecosystems reliant on groundwater networks.
Santos spokesman Matthew Doman, asked if its pursuit of CSG was now more complicated given the new Government's make-up, said: ``We will work constructively with the new Government, including advocating a greater role of natural gas in a carbon-constrained world.''
He said that throughout the period of the caretaker government Santos had maintained regulator contact with the government department handling its proposal.
``And we've had no indication that the time frame has changed,'' he said. ``Our focus is on continuing to develop the project and to do that we need our federal government approvals.''
Ord Minnett mining analyst Peter Arden said he understood that Santos and BG/QGC were ``basically pretty close'' to meeting the requirements for federal environmental approvals and he expected only slight variance in some conditions on the projects.
But he also said there was concern that there might be a new, broader questioning of whether the risks involved in converting coal seam gas into LNG outweighed the benefits.
``My sense of it is that the whole issue of CSG is being called into question and looked at again to see if it's really something we should do in terms of using CSG as an LNG (feedstock),'' Mr Arden said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,3,"VINEYARD owners accuse the energy company AGL of dumping contaminated water in the Hunter Valley, where it is planning to extract coal seam gas.
The state government said it was concerned and had asked AGL to remediate a site near the town of Broke, after 120,000 litres from a groundwater monitoring program was expelled into a paddock the company owns.
 AGL said it was operating safely within the licence it obtained from the NSW Office of Water, and the discharge had had no effect on the surrounding country. Most of the water was taken away by tanker to be treated, it said.
But the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance, a coalition of wine, tourism and thoroughbred racing interests campaigning against what they see as excessive industrialisation of the region, commissioned its own laboratory tests on the water. It said it was concerned about pollution even before the potentially large drilling operations get under way in the region.
 We think they're doing this because AGL had run into a problem because it's expensive to take tankers of water down to Windsor, where it is processed, and it's easier to just dump it on site,  said a spokesman for the Hunter Valley group, John Thomson.
 In our view, AGL is not being held accountable for its actions and the NSW government is not taking sufficient action against the coal seam gas industry. 
The independent tests, undertaken at Hunter Water Laboratories, showed high salt levels and the presence of some chemicals associated with drilling machinery. Photographs sent to the Herald appear to show large areas of grass killed by the discharges.
AGL said the dead vegetation was nothing to do with its drilling.  The disposal did not cause any change to vegetation because the area where the water ponded was a depression with existing poor growth because of waterlogged soils,  AGL's general manager for upstream gas, Mike Moraza, said in a statement.
The company described the water pumped out of its bore as  slightly salty  but less salty than seawater.
 The groundwater brought to surface during drilling was disposed of in accordance with our water bore licence issued by the NSW Office of Water under the Water Act,  Mr Moraza said.  This approval allows for disposal of water to land during construction, although AGL was proactive in tankering most of the water from the site. 
AGL was awarded two  green globe awards  by the state government this year for sustainable use of natural resources and  climate change leadership .
Staff from the Department of Industry and Investment, which is the responsible authority for coal seam gas exploration, have inspected the area.
 The quality of the water was of concern to [the department] with potential to affect soil salinity,  a spokeswoman said.
 The department has issued AGL with a direction to remediate the affected site. Industry and Investment NSW has asked AGL to provide further information. The matter is not closed. 
AGL has 16 groundwater monitoring bores in the district, and these are separate and less deep than bores drilled to extract coal seam gas. Four main holes and 15 production wells for gas have been drilled for the Broke district as part of the gas exploration.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The debate over just when Santos will pull the trigger on its coming circa $2 billion equity raising continues, and the latest talk suggests the Adelaide-based company will move as soon as its $16 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project wins federal government environment approvals. Santos is set to raise the equity to ensure it can maintain its credit rating throughout the construction process at GLNG.
It is exploring a number of fund-raising options, including a hybrid issue that could raise between $500Â million and $700 million, and is closing in on the sale of at least a 15 per cent stake in GLNG to Korea Gas and Sinopec. That deal should see it receive $1 billion to $1.5Â billion, plus reduce its share of the project's capex costs. But the equity raising, which analysts have estimated could raise up to $3Â billion, continues to intrigue.
 Early tips suggested Santos was likely to act once the Kogas and Sinopec deals were locked away â€“ events that are likely to occur this month.
It now sounds as though Santos won't move until Peter Garrett or whoever is the federal environment minister in Julia Gillard's new cabinet approves the development, which was pencilled in for October 11.
That, of course, assumes Garrett is satisfied with the environmental impact of GLNG.
Any change to the portfolio is likely to lead to further delays as the new minister brings himself or herself up to speed.
Elsewhere, progress on the DUET Group sale of its 29 per cent stake in Pittsburgh-based electricity and distribution company Duquesne Light is proceeding apace.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,3,"More than 30 people were injured on Thursday when an explosion rocked a neighbourhood near San Francisco, setting at least 20 homes ablaze and sending residents fleeing in panic.
Local utility officials said they believe the source of the blast was a large natural gas pipe that ran underground through San Bruno, where some houses in several blocks near San Francisco International Airport were reduced to smouldering ruins and authorities conducted emergency evacuations.
 More than 30 people were treated at a local Kaiser Permanente hospital in San Bruno, while others were rushed to burn units at other medical facilities, according to hospital spokesman Karl Sonkin.
Workers from the San Francisco coroner's office arrived at the scene of the disaster at about 9pm local time indicating people may have died in the blast and subsequent fire.
 This is really a tragedy,  Sonkin said.  We are caring for people as best we can. 
Several fire crews were on the scene attempting to douse what witnesses described as a massive  ball of fire .
 I heard a sound like a low flying plane, then all of a sudden the house shook,  said Tina DiIoia, who was with her baby in their condominium in the town of San Bruno, just south of San Francisco, when the explosion occurred about a kilometre away.
 Then there was another explosion. I went outside and there was debris falling from the air. 
Flames had spread to more than 20 homes and people were being evacuated from areas downwind of the inferno.
 It looks like the entire mountainside is burning,  DiIoia said as she and her husband took their baby and evacuated the town.
The blast so close to the busy airport had initially sparked fears of terrorism, ahead of Saturday's ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, but there was no information suggesting a link.

Hundreds of homes have been damaged in an area near the airport, many reduced to smouldering cinders by the intensity of the blaze. The explosion's believed to have been caused by the rupture of a large natural gas pipeline.
WITNESS: I couldn't figure out exactly what this sound was. It just got louder and louder and I finally looked up out of my window and just saw this - the sky was just aflame.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"SANTOS could be forced to raise up to $3 billion after French oil major Total agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in its Queensland liquefied natural gas project for $867 millionâ€” a price that underwhelmed the market and sent shares lower.
Under the deal, Total will pay Santos $650 million for a 15 per cent stake and $217 million to Santos's joint venture partner Petronas for a further 5 per cent of the Gladstone LNG project destined for Curtis Island.
 Total, Europe's third-largest oil producer, has also signed a binding heads of agreement to take 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from the project over 20 years, starting in 2014. Petronas also has agreed to increase its LNG order from 2 million tonnes a year to 3.5 million tonnes. Of the 5 million tonnes of offtake agreements already struck, worth about $100 billion, 1.7 million tonnes a year will come from a second processing train.
Santos chief executive David Knox hopes the deals will create some momentum around train two, despite the project not yet having adequate reserves to support it.
Analysts called the Santos announcement everything from  disappointing  to  a shocker , but Mr Knox defended the deal, saying the purpose was to  underpin the future of the project .
 What we have done is bring in one of the world's super majors, Total, combined with a really strong national oil company in Petronas and we have sold 5 million tonnes of LNG,  he said.
 If you ask does this add economic value to our shareholders? It absolutely does. In every way. I am not looking short term, I am looking long term and we are in a business that will be delivering LNG from this project until 2034. 
But the market sent Santos shares down 7 per cent, or 96Â¢, to $12.79 on expectations that Santos's 15 per cent stake could fetch up to $1 billion based on its previous deal with Petronas. Santos will also forgo a $500 million payment from Petronas, having now struck the additional offtake agreement.
Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Nik Burns said Santos could be forced to tap the market for up to
$3 billion.
 Our original equity forecast requirement of $1.5-$2 billion probably rises by $1 billion, but conservatism on our $20 billion capital expenditure forecast may be largely offsetting,  he said.
 Overall, we would have thought the market is a little disappointed given the recent hype and now concerns over funding and where second-train gas will come from are likely to keep the hand brakes on. Long term, we still see value, but Oil Search and Woodside are probably safer bets. 
Mr Knox said if an equity raising was required he would knock on the door of all shareholders to chip in through an entitlement offer.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"SANTOS has sold a 15 per cent stake in the Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project to French energy major Total in a surprise deal that secured an estimated $30 billion in gas sales but wiped $800 million off Santos's market value.
Total has agreed to buy the stake for $650m and to sign binding agreements to buy 1.5 million tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years.
 The deal underpins a final investment decision on a $10bn GLNG first production train, but comes at an unexpected cost.
As part of related deals with GLNG joint venture partner Petronas, Santos will forfeit a $US500m payment Petronas was to make when a final investment decision on a second train was made.
Santos has also agreed to give the joint venture, in which it now has a 45 per cent stake, Queensland coal-seam gas ground that Santos chief executive David Knox has said may hold between 500 and 1000 petajoules of gas.
On the positive side, Santos will be able to sell gas from its other east coast operations, such as the Cooper Basin, into the LNG project.
The market had expected the sale of a 15 per cent stake to fetch between $500m and $1bn without any compromises, and the letdown sparked a 96c, or 7 per cent, fall in Santos shares to $12.79, the stock's biggest one-day slump in 15 months.
Santos chief David Knox said he was surprised by the slump after Santos had brought in a ``super major'' and boosted LNG sales deals from the project.
``I think people have missed the scale of what we've done almost completely,'' Mr Knox told The Australian. ``We've got a really strong partner in Total, they've given us a fabulous affirmation of the project and we've sold 5 million tonnes of LNG.''
Mr Knox said the LNG prices received were very good, but he would not disclose what they were, other than to say the 5 million tonnes a year would deliver a total of more than $100bn in revenue over 20 years.
As well as the 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG Total has agreed to take, Petronas lifted to 3.5 million tonnes a previous commitment to take up to 3 million tonnes of LNG, bringing overall committed sales to 5 million tonnes a year.
Santos's biggest shareholder, BlackRock, had reservations about the deal, questioning Mr Knox about its value on an investor conference call.
``If I'm doing a brutal assessment it would be that you've sold down 15 per cent of your equity for a net $100m,'' Lou Caparelli, a Melbourne-based BlackRock director, said to Mr Knox.
Mr Caparelli said the $US500m payment from Petronas that had been forfeited now needed to come from somewhere else.

Continued from Page 21
Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Williams said the negatives of the deal probably outweighed the positives.
``The bit that surprised was the $650m in the front door and $US500m out the back door,'' Mr Williams said.
``It's very difficult to put a rosy picture on that.''
Santos plans to make an investment decision this year on a first LNG production train, which will produce 3.6 million tonnes a year, and a second of the same size next year.
It will need to raise debt and equity to fund its share of the developments, which are expected to cost a combined $15bn.
UBS and Deutsche Bank are currently marketing an equity-linked hybrid instrument in Europe on behalf of Santos that is expected to raise between $500m and $750m.
Total, which is the most bullish of the energy majors on LNG growth, has also agreed to buy 5 per cent of the project for $217m from Santos's GLNG partner Petronas, bringing the French major's stake to 20 per cent. The deal leaves Santos with a 45 per cent stake and Petronas with a 35 per cent stake in the project.t
Santos is expected to sell a further stake to Korea Gas and potentially Sinopec but is determined to remain the biggest shareholder.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"A $100-BILLION gas deal signed yesterday puts Queensland only a step away from 6000 new jobs and $120 million a year in state royalties.
French oil and gas giant Total paid $860 million to sign on as a 20 per cent partner of Santos's liquified natural gas project in Gladstone and committed to buying enough gas, along with Malaysian partner Petronas, to help underwrite the $7-billion scheme.
 The project needs only federal government environmental approval, due next month, before the companies can make a final decision.
The news came as official figures showed Queensland's job drive had stalled with 12,400 people losing their jobs in August and another 4400 giving up on the workforce on seasonally adjusted terms.
Despite this, the state's unemployment rate dropped to 5.4 per cent because of a smaller workforce allowing the State Government to say it was still on course to reach its 100,000 jobs target.
``It's further evidence of the fact that while a recovery from the global financial crisis is under way, we are not completely out the other side,'' Treasurer Andrew Fraser said.
Nationally, unemployment fell from 5.3 per cent to 5.1 per cent. The Santos-Total gas deal was considered a massive shot of confidence for the emerging industry with the 18,000 jobs the four planned projects are expected to generate.
Total's involvement means that the world's fifth biggest oil and gas company had confidence in the project, Deputy Premier Paul Lucas said. However, Santos managing director David Knox admitted a potential lack of workers was an issue. ``The issue of labour is clearly something we have to work hard on,'' he said.
The industry also faces hurdles dealing with water and salt by-products of coal seam gas extraction.
While the gas deal is a huge one for the state, official figures have also shown that the mining boom has returned with a vengeance, with Australia's resource companies earning a massive $44 billion in just three months.
The total was a 40 per cent increase on the previous quarter and is expected to underpin major job growth in Queensland with recruitment agencies predicting a huge surge in demand and a potential wages breakout.
Michael Roche, the chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, said the figures were evidence that the super-cycle resources boom had only been interrupted by the global financial crisis.
Companies already are hiking salaries in the mining sector and diesel mechanics are earning up to $50 an hour in Bowen Basin mines while highly skilled engineers are being offered up to $200,000 a year.
Even mining recruitment companies in the resources sector are finding it tough.
``I'd employ a dozen recruiters today if I could find the right people,'' Brisbane-based Talent2 general manager Craig Sneesby said.
He said a perfect storm was developing that would eventuate when the Queensland mining industry and the emerging gas industry started to fight over employees. ``It will be an arm wrestle for talent,'' he said.
``We are right at the tipping point and we have so many customers who are stockpiling staff.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"SANTOS shares tumbled to a two-month low yesterday as investors fretted that a disappointing sale price for its Gladstone LNG stake meant it would need a big equity raising to help fund its pipeline project.
Its share price fell 96, or 7 per cent, to $12.79 after it sold a 15 per cent stake in its GLNG coal seam gas-to-LNG project to French LNG producer Total for $650 million.
 Analysts said the price was disappointing as it failed to match the valuation Petronas paid for its 40 per cent stake in GLNG just two years ago.
They said it was now more likely Santos would have to stage an equity raising, possibly a rights issue that could be worth more than $1 billion, to meet the investment needed for its pipeline, including its share of the $7.7 billion GLNG project. An equity raising of this size could dilute the value of Santos shares.
The Total deal is subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and other regulatory clearances.
After the sale to Total, Santos' GLNG stake will drop to 45 per cent from 60 per cent while Malaysian partner Petronas will sell a 5 per cent stake to Total, shifting its holding to 35 per cent and taking Total's stake to 20 per cent.
It is Total's first major investment in an LNG project using unconventional gas, and Total's exploration and production managing director for Australia, Mike Sangster, said the GLNG project was attractive because Total wanted to lift its share of the Asian LNG market.
Santos said it signed an LNG offtake deal with Total, and increased a prior offtake deal with Petronas, collectively providing for the sale of five million tonnes of LNG a year from GLNG for a total value of about $100 billion.
It said that underpinned the two-train development, but it would aim to secure a further supply deal for another two million tonnes which is more
likely to be sealed after fed-
eral environmental approvals.
The offtake agreements are a binding 20-year deal with Total for the sale of 1.5 million tonnes a year from GLNG and the supply of 3.5 million tonnes to Petronas.
Santos said it hoped to receive federal environmental approval next month for the GLNG project, as that was the final hurdle before it could take a final investment decision by late 2010 on its first train, or LNG processing line.
It aims to make a final investment decision on a second train by late 2011 and it aims to be supplying first LNG in 2014.
Santos chief executive David Knox told a press conference in Brisbane yesterday the binding offtake agreements ``go a long way'' to fully selling out its two trains of LNG production at Gladstone.
``They give the GLNG project an enormous push towards final investment decision which we will take on the first train by the end of this year.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"SANTOS did not expect any difficulties in winning federal environmental approval for its coal seam gas project, chief executive David Knox said yesterday.
But Mr Knox declined to say if the company had solved a key problem with contaminated water.
 Santos plans to extract vast quantities of water from the Surat Basin, part of the Murray-Darling Basin, for coal seam gas that will be piped to a plant on Gladstone's Curtis Island to produce liquefied natural gas for Asian export markets.
But Darling Downs farmers have held protests to call for the CSG industry's expansion to be halted until scientific studies into the cumulative impacts from mining on groundwater can rule out risk of serious depletion or contamination.
Mr Knox said the only remaining hurdle to its final investment decision later this year on the project's first stage was the federal Environment Minister's decision, expected early next month, on whether to grant approval.
A Senate report last December on mining impacts on the Murray-Darling Basin found: ``It is possible existing mining operations in the Darling Downs are largely compliant with the current regulatory framework.
``However, a lack of scientific knowledge can make it hard to know whether it is actually protecting water resources and water quality within the basin.''
Asked if Santos had solved the problem regulators raised about contaminated water brought to the surface, Mr Knox said: `` `Solved' is probably not the right way to put it.
``The issue here is to make sure we manage our operations in a highly responsible way.''
Deputy Premier Paul Lucas said Santos' new deals were a ``trifecta'' for the companies and Queensland and he denied a gamble was being taken with environmental and groundwater assets.
``There's no good saying that we want to move away from coal as a fuel of choice in this country, then not be prepared to produce gas,'' he said.
``We will insist on tough standards and the Commonwealth will ensure that as well.
``We hope to receive a favourable decision from the Federal Government, but it's their decision to make and we're not going to pre-empt it.''

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"ENERGY company AGL and environmentalists are at odds over the discharge of saline water near a coal-seam gas test site near Bulga.
Hunter Valley Protection Alliance spokesman John Thomson said AGL and the state government had  intentionally whitewashed  the community over the discharge of 120,000 litres of underground water that flooded and killed an adjoining pasture.
 Mr Thomson said AGL was obliged to cart the water for treatment but discharged it to save costs. He said the alliance would hold a protest against coal-seam gas exploration at Sunday's Broke village fair.
An AGL spokesman acknowledged the water discharge but said it was allowed under its state government water bore licence.
Mr Thomson said the group had the water sampled and found it contained glycol and ethers, which he said were signs of  fraccing  - a process used in coal-seam exploration.
The AGL spokesman said its independent tests showed no signs of glycol or ethers, and that the water came from groundwater monitoring, not coal-seam exploration.
A government spokesman said AGL had a licence for water bores but was directed to remediate the land after the discharge.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Oil and gas producer Santos expects to lock in a major liquefied natural gas deal with Korea Gas within weeks as it attempts to win back support from investors disappointed by a surprise deal with French oil and gas giant Total for a stake in its Gladstone project.
Yesterday Santos announced a $30 billion deal for Total to buy 1.5 million tonnes of LNG a year from its proposed $16 billion Gladstone LNG project in Queensland. Total will also purchase a 20 per cent stake in the project for $860 million, including a 15 per cent stake from Santos for $650 million.
 But shares in Santos fell 7 per cent because analysts had expected a 15 per cent stake in GLNG to fetch about $1 billion.
In several changes to the project announced as part of the Total deal, Santos's existing partner in GLNG, Malaysian state-owned giant Petronas â€“ which had agreed to buy up to 3 million tonnes a year of LNG from the project â€“ has agreed to take another 500,000 tonnes a year.
But it will now not pay a $US500 million ($545 million) bonus that it had previously agreed to pay Santos in the event GLNG reached key milestones. That will leave an extra hole in Santos's finances as it prepares to make a final investment decision on GLNG by the end of the year and increases the odds of the company going ahead with a $2 billion-plus equity raising as early as next month. Santos executives and their advisers have also been in Europe for the past week testing the appetite for a hybrid issue of up to $700 million to support the project.
In addition, Santos has agreed to vend into the GLNG joint-venture coal seam gas acreage that it previously owned 100 per cent.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the Total-Petronas deals had been  highly accretive  to the economics of the project, despite what the share price reaction suggested.
 What we've done is establish a project for the next 20 years, rather than focus on a short-term funding issue that we may or may not have over the next three or four months,  he said.
Santos said the GLNG project had now secured offtake contracts covering 5 million tonnes a year of production and likely to be worth more than $100 billion over 20 years.
The partners plan to develop two LNG trains, or processing lines, at GLNG over two stages, with each train capable of producing 3.6 million tonnes per annum.
Mr Knox said Santos was deep in discussions with several Asian LNG buyers and acknowledged for the first time that Kogas was among them. Kogas has said previously it is aiming to secure an offtake agreement this month and a 10 per cent equity stake in GLNG.
Mr Knox said Santos was prepared to sell down its GLNG stake in order to lock in another buyer, as long as it remained the largest interest holder in the project. After yesterday's deal, it will hold 45 per cent of GLNG, with Petronas owning 35 per cent and Total 20 per cent.
 We're not done yet,  Mr Knox said.  We've demonstrated an ability to do mega deals in the offtake space. Here's one of the world's super majors wanting to participate in this great project, it's a huge affirmation. 
The equity raising and federal environmental approvals now remain the last hurdles before the GLNG partners can approve the project for development.
GLNG and the rival Queensland Curtis LNG project of BG Group are both waiting on federal Environment Minister Peter Garret to approve them. Mr Garret has said he will make his decision known next October in what looms as the first major test of the federal government's environmental credentials since it struck a deal with the Greens and three independents to claim power.
Mr Knox said work to date with federal authorities had not identified any  show stoppers .
Queensland Deputy Premier Paul Lucas said he was confident the project â€“ which will generate about 6000 jobs â€“ would receive environmental approval from Canberra.
 It's important to acknowledge the decision is an independent one. We've seen them knock off Traveston Dam for their own reasons and we weren't exactly thrilled about that,  he said We're confident in our own state approval process that everything that needs to be done has been done and we look forward and hope to receive a favourable decision from the commonwealth government, but it will be up to them,  he said.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said yesterday's developments were  something of a mixed message  given the market's expectations of a deal with Kogas, but the involvement of Total would be  fantastic  for the project.  There is $US500 million that is now not coming forward and that is equity risk, so we'll wait and see what happens with the remaining 10 per cent or so that Kogas thinks it's going to buy and how much that's going to bring in. 
Total, the fifth-largest public oil and gas company in the world, also owns a 24 per cent stake in the Ichthys LNG project planned for development in northern Australia. It has stakes in producing LNG projects in seven countries.
Shares in Santos closed down 7 per cent to $12.79, after falling as low as $12.71 during the day.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Analysis
Gladstone's modest Curtis Island is shaping up as a microcosm of the world's oil industry as global heavyweights jostle for position in the world's next global hotspot for Asian liquefied natural gas.
 The surprise entry of French oil giant Total into Santos's $16 billion GLNG project in Queensland has beefed up the venture and adds one of the biggest LNG players in the Atlantic Basin with recognised marketing capability.
It also seems to rule out any consolidation between Santos and Royal Dutch Shell for the first production unit at GLNG and makes it problematic at best for train two, set to follow 12 months later.
With Petronas and Total already major partners, adding Shell and its partner PetroChina would bring multiple extra complications. The GLNG venture is still also in talks with Asian customers, including Korea Gas, which are still likely come on board as minority owners.
Shell's new chairman of its Australian operations, Ann Pickard, foreshadowed that changed emphasis earlier this week when she dropped Shell's previously enthusiastic talk of consolidation between its own coal seam gas assets and others. Any hopes that Shell and PetroChina might somehow bring forward their own CSG-LNG production plans on Curtis Island are now fading fast.
Total, the world's fifth-biggest oil company, has flown largely under the radar in Australia, where its only other interests, apart from exploration licences, is a 24 per cent stake in Inpex's planned $23 billion Ichthys LNG venture in the Browse Basin, acquired four years ago.
But the timetable for Ichthys has been repeatedly delayed and Total is understood to be keen to move ahead rapidly to develop an LNG presence in Australia. A final go-ahead for Ichthys is only pencilled in for late 2011, a year later than for GLNG, with start-up in 2016, up to two years behind the Queensland project.
That puts GLNG firmly at the top of Total's emerging pipeline of LNG investments in Australia, which will complement its string of supply projects in countries including Qatar, Yemen, Nigeria, Angola and Norway.
As Total's Australia exploration and production boss Mike Sangster pointed out yesterday, the French major had been scouting round for more LNG opportunities in Australia and made the  obvious decision  to invest in GLNG after studying all the options. The project's likelihood of going ahead counted in its favour.
But he was keen to point out this deal in no way diminishes Total's desire to see Ichthys also proceed. That project has struggled with a lack of momentum, illustrated by schedule deferrals and an absence of news on LNG customer accords despite some of its targeted Japanese buyers freely signing up for fuel from rival projects.
Total, which will buy 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from GLNG to go into its global trading portfolio, can be comfortable also with the price it has paid to secure a foothold in the Queensland CSG-LNG space.
It will pay just $860 million for the 20 per cent stake it is buying from Santos and Petronas, a discount of more than 20 per cent to the $2.2 billion Petronas paid for 40 per cent back in 2008 before the worst of the global financial crisis hit.
The fact Malaysia's Petronas was willing to sell part of its stake at that price is being seen among Asian LNG observers as an admission that it overpaid for its interest, although it was a different economic climate.
"
AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"SHELL Australia chairman Ann Pickard has warned Woodside and the West Australian government not to  back stakeholders into a corner  in developing the $30 billion Browse liquefied natural gas project.
Slightly more than a week after Colin Barnett's government started proceedings to acquire compulsorily Kimberley land for Woodside's LNG hub, Ms Pickard has urged her joint-venture partner in the project to continue talks with all stakeholders, including Kimberley Aborigines, to give the project the best chance of being delivered. Analysts believe Browse could be bogged down in the courts for up to five years as native title disputes are played out.
 In a wide-ranging interview with BusinessDay, Ms Pickard said Shell â€” a joint-venture partner in Browse alongside operator Woodside, Chevron, BHP Billiton and BP â€” was satisfied with the level of engagement from all parties so far, but said talks needed to continue to give the project every chance of success.
 You have $200 billion destined in Australian LNG projects, they won't all happen for a number of reasons,  she said.  One thing you never want to do is to back stakeholders into a corner. I am happy to see that the government has an engagement policy as part of those moves towards compulsory acquisition.
 There is six months of mandatory engagement and there has been a lot of engagement already. We are supportive of Woodside and the government continuing that engagement. 
Ms Pickard, from Wyoming, was brought to Australia in March to head Shell's Australian oil and gas operations. She was appointed as Russell Caplan's successor as chairman in June. Described by Fortune magazine as  the bravest woman in oil , Ms Pickard said she was determined that all Shell's LNG projects would proceed.
The projects include Australia's largest resource project, Gorgon, operated by Chevron, the Prelude floating LNG project off Western Australia, the Sunrise floating LNG project in the Timor Sea and Browse. Shell also has a stake in the North-West Shelf venture.
Ms Pickard said her focus was on ensuring all Shell's projects were approved rather than searching for mergers and acquisitions. Shell has been the subject of persistent rumours that it could seek a tie-up with Santos in the Queensland LNG market or make a takeover bid for Woodside.
 There is organic growth and there is non-organic growth and Shell is pretty focused on organic growth,  Ms Pickard said.
 I think in Australia we have $30 billion-plus planned to be spent on existing projects so I am not anxious to be doing a lot of mergers and acquisitions unless the opportunity presents itself. I think in regards to Queensland . . . consolidation is a possibility but it isn't what I would call a slam dunk. It may happen it may not happen. 
Ms Pickard called on the Gillard government to prioritise putting a price on carbon during its current term, saying it was critical for business to know what the operating environment would look like.
 We don't like uncertainty,  Ms Pickard said.  I would much rather have a clear set of rules on what the future looks like on carbon dioxide then have this uncertainty. We believe in a market approach, a cap and trade approach.
 The sooner that certainty comes, the better it is.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"SAN FRANCISCO: At least one person was killed and more than 30 others injured when a natural gas pipeline exploded yesterday in the neighbourhood of San Bruno, setting homes ablaze and sending residents fleeing in panic. Some houses in several blocks near San Francisco International Airport were reduced to smoking ruins.
The San Mateo County coroner's office confirmed one death related to the explosion.
 Deputy Coroner April Florent told the San Francisco Chronicle ``there are deaths, but we do not have a number right now''.
More than 30 people were treated at a San Bruno hospital, while others were rushed to burn units. ``This is really a tragedy,'' hospital spokesman Karl Sonkin said. ``We are caring for people as best we can.''
Pacific Gas and Electric Company spokesman Jeff Smith told the Chronicle one of the utility's natural gas transmission lines had ruptured, although the cause was unknown. ``If it is ultimately determined that we were responsible for the cause of this incident, we will take accountability,'' Mr Smith said. ``Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this terrible situation.''
Witnesses described a massive ``ball of fire'' that billowed skyward after a huge explosion. ``I heard a sound like a low-flying plane, then all of a sudden the house shook,'' said Tina DiIoia, who was with her baby in their apartment about 1km away from the blast.
``Then there was another explosion. I went outside and there was debris falling from the air.''

SANTOS chief David Knox this week brought certainty and one of the world's biggest liquefied natural gas players to the Gladstone LNG project as well as providing a potential avenue to market Cooper Basin shale gas, which is stranded at current prices.
 The market reaction?
To wipe $1.3 billion from the company's value in the stock's two most frenzied trading days in more than a year.
A big reason for the drop was that the entrance of French major Total to the project came with the forfeiture of a $US500 million ($540m) payment due to Santos from GLNG joint venture partner Petronas. And this just before the company is expected to have to raise up to $2bn from the sharemarket to fund the project.
Knox does not appear overly concerned by the share slump and the short-term focus of a market he says is not seeing the big picture. ``We've got to look beyond the short-term share price,'' Knox tells The Weekend Australian. ``It's really important as a chief executive that you focus on creating long-term value and we know this does.
``This has economic value that swamps the $US500m that we have forgone for the second train -- absolutely swamps it.''
While that might be the case, Thursday's announcement that Total had bought a 20 per cent stake in GLNG (15 per cent from Santos and 5 per cent from Petronas) let down a market that was expecting a similar deal with Korea Gas or Sinopec to be announced, free from any compromises.
As a result, Santos shares have slipped 11.3 per cent in the past two days, with each day producing the highest trading volumes since a May 2009 equity raising was announced.
``The market doesn't like surprises and the deal we'd done with Total was very confidential -- and it was kept that way,'' Knox says. ``I believe when they (investors) reflect on it they will see this was an extremely strong deal.''
Between now and the end of the year is crunch time for Knox.
That is the timetable he has set himself to get all government and board approvals to build a $10bn-plus LNG production train at Gladstone. To do so, he will need to arrange funding and fully commit gas for a second train -- investment approval for which is expected 12 months later.
Environmental approval is due by October 11, which is expected to clear the way for announcements of further equity and LNG sales agreements with Korea Gas and Sinopec.
To scrape together its share of the project costs for the first train -- which could be as much as $6bn, based on Santos's current 45 per cent interest -- Knox does not rule in, or out, cancelling dividend payments.
He says it will all be considered when funding is looked at in the light of the final equity stakes for the project, and when costs are nailed down.

Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood says Santos may be able to limit itself to a $1bn equity raising if it cancels dividend payment, sells another 5 per cent equity stake and issues hybrid securities. ``It seems crazy to effectively raise money to pay a dividend,'' Wood says.
``Although we recognise that, given Santos's franking credits, this may not be well received, this is unquestionably in the best interests of the company, long term.''
Despite labelling the deal as more negative than positive, Macquarie has boosted its net present value estimate of Santos by 3 per cent following the Total deal. Analysts tend to agree the negatives of the deal outweigh the positives.
But the view is that the sharemarket reaction was overdone and was the result of inflated expectations the company had done nothing to puncture.
Knox says talks with Total started at the beginning of last year, but the French company had only become one of the top contenders in the past three to four months.
This was about the time Asian buyers, which were expected to join the project, had eased off their interest because of uncertainty over Kevin Rudd's proposed mining tax.
Analyst remain sceptical the project has enough coal-seam gas to support two trains, which was highlighted by Santos securing the right to supply its other east coast and Cooper Basin gas into the project. Knox says this could be a way to unlock the shale gas potential of the Cooper Basin, which needs domestic gas prices of about $3 a gigajoule to double to be economic.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"AUSTRALIA'S gas industry is being considered as policy-makers work out how to deal with a blowout in transport fuel import costs to $30 billion a year by 2015.
With the present fuel trade cost standing at $16bn annually and national oil self-sufficiency having fallen from more than 85 per cent in 2000 to 52 per cent today, the Energy Networks Association has called for the policy silence on natural gas vehicles to end.
 ENA chief executive Andrew Blyth says the prospects for gas-fuelled cars and commercial vehicles need to be seen against forecasts that transport fuel self-sufficiency could plummet to only 18 per cent by 2030.
This may not be a cause for alarm if the global oil outlook can be characterised by abundance and affordability, he says.
``Unfortunately, the outlook is characterised by a high level of uncertainty and strong suggestions that oil-based fuels are likely to be increasingly scarce over the next 20 years, with a significant risk of dramatic cost increases,'' Blyth says.
Australia's geographic spread of big cities and its heavy reliance on transport to move goods as well as to service exports, he says, means the prospect of fuel cost rises for households and businesses represents substantial micro-economic and trade competitive risks.
Blyth is eager to stress that the association is not talking down the use of electric vehicles. ENA represents electricity and gas delivery companies.
There is a strong need for government and industry to work together to understand the technical, commercial and policy issues that have to be addressed if electric vehicles are to be introduced on a large scale, he says.
The benefits of also using natural gas in lieu of conventional oil-based fuels have long been recognised, he adds, ``but the apparent complexity of converting this opportunity have resulted in policy-makers shying away from the option over 10 to 15 years''.
Blyth says natural gas can be used across all vehicle classes and twin advantages: it is abundantly available in Australia and its use would cut down transport greenhouse gas emissions by 10 per cent to
25 per cent.
There are three main reasons the promotion of natural gas for vehicles has failed, he says. There is a lack of supply chain co-ordination, market uncertainty leading to investor uncertainty and non-complementary legislation and tax policy.
He has called for the Coalition and the ALP to agree to establish an industry-government taskforce to ``assemble a blueprint'' for the realisation of the energy independence and greenhouse gas benefits through using natural gas as a transport fuel.
Blyth says the taskforce should also address existing structural failure by identifying a means of co-ordinating vehicle supply, fuel supply and legislative action.
Industry members of the taskforce should include car and truck manufacturers, fuel suppliers and fuelling technology providers. Consumer organisations also should be represented.
The ENA is also calling for bipartisan political support for the establishment of a gas vehicle technology and infrastructure fund, financed federally, with grant applications overseen by a joint industry-government taskforce. The fund can't be small, Blyth points out. ``It needs to be commensurate with the total public good dividend to be gained from energy independence, strengthening the automotive industry and greenhouse and urban air pollution benefits,'' he says.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"A LIBERAL National Party MP has been slapped down over claims the massive coal seam gas industry should be temporarily scrapped in the Condamine region because of its feared impact on critically needed ground water.
Darling Downs MP Ray Hopper said the risk to ground water through the process could not be quantified and it was unclear how long it would take before there was a better understanding.
 ``But it is very clear that dewatering coal beds here will damage this water resource,'' he said.
``The problem is that if we damage the alluvium we may not know for even 40 or 50 years if there is a problem.''
His demands came after months of furious protesting from irrigators and crop farmers about the threat the industry poses to critical ground water.
Mr Hopper, the LNP's primary industry spokesman, said his call for a moratorium was made in his role as a local member of Parliament.
But former Opposition leader and now natural resources spokesman Jeff Seeney said it was a knee-jerk reaction to an independent report on ground water that had been widely misinterpreted.
``No, I don't support Ray's call at all,'' Mr Seeney said.
``I don't think it's the right way to approach a developing industry.''
The Basin Sustainability Alliance applauded Mr Hopper's stance and said a report by hydro-geologist John Hilliard showed that CSG would deplete the Condamine Alluvium, a critical source of water
for farmers on the Darling Downs.
But Mr Seeney said the coal seam gas industry presented a unique opportunity to recharge the ground water by taking deeper, saline water from the gas extraction process, treating it and reinjecting it back into the shallow aquifer that can be used by farmers.
``It's not rocket science and has been used elsewhere in Queensland for over 40 years,'' Mr Seeney said.
``The report has been grossly misreported.''

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,3,"THE booming liquefied natural gas industry in Western Australia's rugged north is about as remote as it gets for those living on the Gold Coast.
But for Alex Handley, it's just an average commute.
 The mining industry specialist, who runs the family-controlled firm Handley Surveys, reckons the Coast is a hard place to get out of your system, so that is why he settled back here a few years ago.
The businessman, a TSS old boy who grew up on the Coast, lives at Burleigh Heads with his young family, but his day job involves controlling a staff of 28, many of them at Karratha in WA at the heart of the nation's LNG industry.
Although he moved back to the Coast in 2006, he is planning to head north with his family to Gladstone as the LNG industry in Queensland gathers momentum.
Handley Surveys, whose clients include Woodside Petroleum and Rio Tinto, operates in a highly specialised field in the LNG sector.
The company surveys the construction plans for LNG plants, certifying the geometry of the designs.
The LNG plants are often component-built in Asia and assembled with pinpoint accuracy on site in Australia.
Handley Surveys lifted its profile in July after winning a WA Telstra Business Award for medium-sized businesses, from several high-calibre competitors.
It was a big deal for the former Gold Coast company, causing the phones to `ring off the hook' for about a month.
Handley Surveys moved to the west from the Coast 10 years ago after taking on what was thought to be a quick job for Woodside.
``We went there to do a month's work and knocked it over in a week and Woodside said to us, `Why don't you hang around?' '' said Mr Handley.
Now, the plan is to target Gladstone which will be the country's next LNG hotspot once plans progress for a new plant to process Queensland's massive coalseam gas reserves.
``It's really early days for us at this stage,'' said Mr Handley of his plans to move north.
``But being close to our clients allows us to deliver that service. At the end of the day our service is so specialised, to get it right we have to talk to them directly.''
Mr Handley said the surveying industry might be viewed as `dull and boring', but his team did not reflect that image.
``Our team's young and dynamic, with an average age of 27,'' he said.
``They're all fit, good-looking guys. They're smart, they play in bands, they're sportsman.''
They also earn about $180,000 a year, he said, and Handley helps put them on the right course to manage their money through financial planners.
``These guys are professionals. They're not cashed-up bogans,'' said Mr Handley of his workforce.
``We don't have any guys driving flash cars or wasting money. They're pretty smart.''

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"BOOM BRISBANE, Sept 12 AAP - The explosion and gas fire in San Francisco should be a warning to Queensland amid its massive gas boom, an environmental campaigner says.
The San Francisco incident, which has claimed at least six lives, injured many more and burnt out a whole suburb, reflects the dangers that large-scale natural gas developments represent for communities, said Drew Hutton.
  Authorities are now conceding the fire was caused by the rupturing of a high pressure gas pipeline,  the Friends of the Earth campaigner told AAP in a statement.
He said uncontrolled experiment in gas development was occurring on the Darling Downs and this could have similar impacts to the US incident.
 We have had reports about wellhead leaks, unprotected wellheads where cattle knock valves and there is no doubt that with the highly plastic clay soils on the Downs there will be accidents which will also lead to leaks,  Mr Hutton said.
He said that within the last 12 months there have been a major well head leak, three pipeline leaks and two significant saline water spills.
 The Queensland government recently audited 58 gas wells near Tara and found 26 to be leaking, one a major leak, four significant leaks and 20 odd minor leaks. 
Mr Hutton said the rural residential estate outside the western Darling Downs town of Tara, home to about 2,000 people, has many gas wells, high pressure pipelines and compressor stations and, in all likelihood, will have a LNG plant in the area before too long.
 The Tara residential estate is just the sort of place where a gas accident could result in a horrific bushfire scenario which could endanger many lives,  Mr Hutton said.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,3,"US federal and state investigators say the section of natural gas pipeline that ruptured and exploded in a deadly fireball near San Francisco had been categorised as high risk because it ran through a highly populated area.
Thursday evening's blast and fire devastated a San Bruno neighbourhood, killing at least four people and injuring nearly 60.
 Police said on Saturday that five people still were missing. They also said remains had been found but did not elaborate, leaving unclear whether they were those of a victim or victims already accounted for.
One of the dead worked for the commission reviewing the Pacific Gas & Electric utility company's investment plans to upgrade its natural gas lines, including another risky section of the same pipeline within kilometres of her home, a colleague confirmed.
Longtime California Public Utilities Commission analyst Jacqueline Greig and her 13-year-old daughter Janessa died in the massive blast, which left a crater near their house and laid waste to dozens of 1960s-era homes in the hills overlooking San Francisco Bay.
Jessica Morales, 20, was also killed in the explosion and fire.
One other victim has not been identified.
Greig spent part of the summer evaluating PG&E's expansion plans and investment proposals to replace out-of-date pipes, co-worker Pearlie Sabino said.
Sabino and Greig were members of a small commission team that advocates for consumer and environmental protections pertaining to natural gas.
 It's just so shocking because she was one of the ones who was most closely involved with this kind of work,  said Mike Florio, a lawyer with a San Francisco-based utility reform advocacy group who worked with Greig.
 Little did we know that pipe was near Jackie's own neighbourhood. 
Documents obtained by The Associated Press showed that PG&E submitted paperwork to regulators that said a section of the same gas line - about 4km from the blast - was within  the top 100 highest-risk line sections  in the utility's service territory.
The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration classified the 30-inch (76-cm) diameter transmission line, which ran for about 2.5km near Greig's home, as a  high consequence area  requiring more stringent inspections called integrity assessments, agency spokeswoman Julia Valentine said.
Across the US, only about seven per cent of gas lines have that classification, she said.
The state commission gave that section of pipe the same classification and had conducted audits on that stretch, spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said. PG&E also had conducted leak surveys, evaluations and patrols on the gas line, she said.
PG&E did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday and referred questions related to the investigation to federal authorities.
Reams of data and records have been requested from PG&E, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Christopher Hart said at a Saturday evening briefing.
The segment of pipe that blew out onto the street was 8.5 metres long, the explosion sent that piece of pipe about 30m and the blast created a crater 51m long and 8m wide, he said.
An inspection of the severed pipe chunk revealed that it was made of several smaller sections that had been welded together and that a seam ran its length, Hart said.
The presence of the welds did not necessarily indicate the pipe had been repaired, he said. Asked whether a welded pipe was more susceptible to leaks or corrosion, Hart said:  Maybe, and maybe not. 
On Saturday, Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, who is serving as acting governor while Arnold Schwarzenegger travels in Asia, directed the commission to perform integrity assessments of all pipeline segments in the area.
Maldonado also ordered further inspections and surveys for high consequence areas, including a detailed inspection of three transmission lines that run through San Mateo County.
PG&E workers have almost finished inspecting its three transmission lines that run through San Bruno and further south down the San Francisco peninsula, PG&E vice president Geisha Williams said.
About 600 San Bruno residents crowded into a church on Saturday to hear city and state officials give updates on when people could expect to return to their homes.
A group of local, state and federal officials toured the damaged area on Saturday and described a ghost town full of remnants of cars melted in driveways and pieces of houses, some left with just the chimney standing.
Besides the 40 homes levelled by the blast, seven were severely damaged, while dozens of other houses were not so badly affected in the fire that sped across six hectares.
Authorities were continuing to treat the site as a crime scene.
On Saturday, PG&E started giving out $US1000 ($A1,084) gift cards, rental car and hotel vouchers to people displaced by the blast.
The company also was prepared to compensate families with relatives killed or injured in the blast and provide long-term housing assistance to those who lost their homes.
 We will do everything we can to make you whole,  the company said.

SUNMAI,Sunday Mail,2010,3,"INVESTIGATORS in San Francisco are trying to determine the cause of the devastating blast that claimed the lives of six people and injured up to 40 more after a natural gas pipeline exploded.
More than 50 buildings were razed to the ground after the massive explosion triggered intense fires which tore through the San Bruno suburb.
 At least 39 people were injured by the blast and flames were visible several kilometres away from San Francisco International Airport.
San Bruno Fire Captain Charlie Barringer told the LA Times: ``I thought a 747 had landed on us. It shook our station right to its foundation.'' Lt-Gov Abel Maldonado, serving as acting governor while Arnold Schwarzenegger is in Asia, declared a state of emergency in the Crestmoor district and said the blaze was 75 per cent contained. ``We don't know what caused (the rupture), we will find out soon,'' Maldonado said.
``There's a lot of devastation in homes, obviously vehicles. The streets are just gone, and all you see are fireplaces standing straight up. It's a horrible tragedy for the people of San Bruno.''
Rick Bruce, 54, a retired police officer who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1980, said the destruction looked like a war zone.
``People want to see if their houses burned down. I was lucky to get in last night. Most people had to leave within 45 minutes, so they saw the flames but didn't know whether their house burned. The fire looked like London during the Blitz,'' he said.
San Bruno Mayor Jim Ruane said: ``The sun is shining over there, but there's still a dark cloud over this city''. The initial explosion was heard kilometres away and shot a fireball more than 300m into the air. Flames reached as high as 30m as the fire fuelled itself on burning homes.
Kelly Huston, an assistant secretary with the California Emergency Management Agency, told KTLA TV: ``We have confirmed that there are 53 structures - those are mostly homes that were lost (and) about 120 damaged''. The injured have been taken to hospitals with special burn treatment units.
Most of the burned buildings were houses in a densely-populated residential area, officials said.
The gas line belongs to the northern California utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
A statement from the company said: ``Though a cause has yet to be determined, we know that a PG&E transmission line was ruptured. If it is ultimately determined that we were responsible for the cause of the incident, we will take accountability''.
Water-bombing aircraft have assisted up to 200 firefighters in tackling the blaze, which was spread quickly by high winds.
Broken water lines have hampered the effort after the explosion destroyed hydrants near the blast scene.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"CLIMATE BRISBANE, Sept 13 AAP - Queenslanders could be subsidising the renewable energy industries of China and India because the state government is locking itself into a future fuelled by fossil fuels, an environmental activist says.
Figures released by Friends of the Earth on Monday reveal Queensland is set to increase its carbon dioxide emissions by 25 per cent over the next four years from new coal and coal seam gas developments alone, and before any of it goes into a power station or steel mill.
  The Bligh government is locking Queensland into an economy dominated by high dependence on fossil fuels, high greenhouse gas emissions and high payments on carbon credits,  said Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton.
He said with the Greens in a position of influence in Canberra, the possibility of the federal government putting a price on carbon is very strong.
 This price, whether as a tax or a credit, is likely to start at about $25 a tonne, as recommended in the Garnaut Report,  Mr Hutton said.
 This price would be passed on to the consumer resulting in Queenslanders paying a total price for these carbon emissions of $4.75 billion.
 This will rise steeply over the following years with the state's rapidly increasing emissions, especially from the development of new coal and coal seam gas mines.
 This bill will increase if there is an international agreement to put a price on carbon. 
Mr Hutton said if there is an international price on carbon in the next few years, Queensland polluters will have to buy carbon credits on the international market.
 The problem is every industrialised country is well over its target and so there will be only a limited number of these credits available,  he said.
 The cost will be astronomical and that cost will ultimately be passed on to the consumer.
 By buying the right to be such a high carbon emitter Queensland will, effectively, be subsidising the renewable energy industries of China and India,  Mr Hutton said.
 Gas is not clean and green.
 It is just another dirty fossil fuel and depending on it will obstruct our progress to a renewable energy future.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"FLOATING PERTH, Sept 13 AAP - Darwin is set to be  the floating LNG capital of the world , Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources Kon Vatskalis says.
Speaking at the Australian Pipeline Industry Association Annual Convention in Darwin on Monday, Mr Vatskalis said the top end looked likely to become a hot-spot for floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments.
  Within 10 years, I suggest to you that we could have five to seven floating LNG projects under development or in production, and the Northern Territory will be the floating LNG capital of the world,  he said.
Floating LNG is increasingly being considered by energy companies seeking to commercialise remote or `stranded' natural gas fields, with processing taking place offshore on large vessels, rather than being piped onshore to a plant.
Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude field, some 475 kilometres north-northeast of Broome, is set to be the world's first floating LNG development when it begins production in 2016.
Also, Woodside Petroleum Ltd wants to use a floating LNG platform for its Sunrise project in the Timor Sea, despite the Timor Leste government calling for an onshore development.
Piping the oil to East Timor would be high cost and carried significant technical risks, Woodside said earlier this year.
 This development plan has now been submitted to the Australian and Timor Leste regulatory authorities and we will see how this progresses in due course,  Mr Vatskalis told the conference on Monday.
 In addition to Sunrise, we have the Bonaparte floating LNG project proposed by the GDF Suez/Santos alliance for the Petrel, Tern and Frigate gas fields, some 250km to 300km to the south west of Darwin.
 This project is currently in pre-FEED (front end engineering design) and is targeting first production in 2018.
 A number of other smaller, stranded gas fields in the Timor Sea to the north and to the west of Darwin are also promoted as being under consideration for floating LNG development by companies with good credentials to deliver projects of this nature. 
In addition to being the site for several floating LNG proposals, the top end had a win in 2008, when Japan's Inpex chose to pipe gas from its $20 billion plus Ichthys project, offshore Western Australia, to an onshore plant at Darwin.
 The Ichthys LNG project is moving toward a ... final investment decision in the fourth quarter of 2011,  Mr Vatskalis said.
 Construction is set to commence in early 2012 and the first LNG cargo is planned for early 2016.

AGEE,The Age,2010,3,"MORE than $10 billion in pipeline infrastructure is expected to be spent in Queensland over the next decade, according to new figures released by the industry, which predicts that number could grow much higher once a Green-tinged Federal Parliament is sworn in.
While much of that $10 billion is awaiting a final investment decision and the completion of gas supply contracts from the coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas proponents before it is spent, Australian Pipeline Industry Association chief executive Cheryl Cartwright said it was vital that federal and state governments were prepared for Queensland's $50 billion-plus LNG boon.
  It is important for Australia that the CSG industry growth is not delayed, and our industry is keen to work with governments to ensure progress of such CSG development,  she said.  Australia has the equivalent of some 250 years worth of natural gas resources in Queensland alone, and we should not miss this opportunity to develop these reserves, as all nations move away from coal-fired power generation. 
Ms Cartwright said Prime Minister Julia Gillard's decision to reappoint Martin Ferguson as Energy and Resources Minister would provide continuity in developing the Queensland LNG sector, for which he showed strong support during the recent mining tax debate.
 If Labor had got in and didn't reappoint Martin Ferguson it would have just been silliness. He knows the industry well, he knows the issues well. He is really practical and just a very sensible person,  she said.
Those calls supporting Mr Ferguson's reappointment extended to other parts of the resources industry with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association describing him as a man of  integrity and honesty .
Ms Cartwright said the new make-up of the Parliament, particularly from July 1 when the Greens would hold the balance of power in the Senate, could mean gas projects were accelerated as a way of reducing emissions.
 If there is a price on carbon there will be an increase in demand for gas and then we are likely to see planned expansion of the current pipelines and that $10 billion figure could go higher,  she said.  It will be interesting to see the rise in influence that the Greens will have. Bob Brown has criticised natural gas as a fossil fuel and said it is not an appropriate energy source, but you can't have renewable energy without back-up fuel.
 If the Greens move towards a pure tax on carbon then that will see an increase in demand for gas, which will be good for emissions and good for the Australian economy because we have so much gas,  Ms Cartwright said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"WITH carbon pricing set to reclaim the political agenda in the new green-tinged federal parliament, the pipeline industry will support the imposition of a ``sensible'' price to encourage generators and energy users to shift from coal to gas-based energy.
The Australian Pipeline Industry Association expects $10 billion of high-pressure gas pipelines will be built in the next decade, ``especially with the continued dramatic development of Queensland's coal-seam gas (CSG) industry''.
 Within Australia's 33,000km of existing high-pressure pipes, 25,000km are used for gas transmission. But alongside fears that export demand for LNG won't support the number of slated projects around Gladstone, domestic gas usage is highly sensitive to the type of carbon pricing regime -- if any -- agreed on by the fractured parliament.
Despite the variables, APIA chief executive Cheryl Cartwright has described the number as an ``incredibly conservative guesstimate''.
``If these CSG developments go ahead they will have to move the gas to the coast,'' she said. ``The fact is that Queensland has 250 years of gas and that's where the focus is.''
Unlike the CSG and LNG projects themselves, the pipelines can be built shortly after demand to move the gas becomes apparent. On this note, regulatory certainty remains a key factor in cystallising demand.
``If the Greens get their way, it's likely we will see a price of carbon of some sort,'' Ms Cartwright said.
``As long as it's a sensitive price of carbon and not so expensive to discourage manufacturers and generators from moving from coal to gas.''
She said while gas was often described as a ``transition fuel'' on the way to a low-emission economy, it would be required as a back-up fuel to solar and wind which are ``intermittent in nature''.
``You need back-up for peak demand and you need something that will fire up quickly.''
She said the existing target of 20 per cent renewable energy by 2020 would ``certainly'' help renewable energy industries, but there was a ``danger that the cost of meeting this target will slow the change from coal to gas by power generators''.
While pipelines suffer an image problem relative to ``sexier'' infrastructure investments such as railways or coal terminals, APIA's annual conference -- held in Darwin from today -- is expected to attract 600 delegates.
As well as transporting gas, the pipeline sector also faced the growing demand for improved water infrastructure, ``as demonstrated through the development of desalination plants and the replacement of open irrigation channels with pipes''.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE cash bonanza from the emerging gas industry has reached more than $12 billion and created 2500 jobs in Queensland, but environmentalists are warning of a big cost yet to come.
The coal seam gas industry has transformed from little more than a niche industry to the point where it is generating boom conditions in central Queensland and is likely to force coal mining companies into a wages war, according to recruitment companies. Gladstone LNG is spending about $70 million a month and has about 500 people on staff while Queensland Gas has an order book for about $3 billion and is hiring two people a day on average.
 Another $30 billion is expected to be spent over the next 10 years by coal seam gas companies if all the plans become reality.
According to industry group Australian Petroleum Producers and Explorers Association chief executive Belinda Robinson, converting CSG to LNG was already a reality.
``This industry has the capacity to transform the Queensland economy and transition Australia and the Asia Pacific to a cleaner energy future,'' she said.
But environmentalists claim the industry will mean Queensland will become a rogue state and possibly jeopardise future trade deals because of its greenhouse gas emissions.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton, who has led the campaign against CSG, accused the Bligh Government of hypocrisy by having an Office of Climate Change headed by the Premier's husband, Greg Withers, that champions renewable energy while the Government promotes massive expansion of fossil fuels.
He said coal seam gas would potentially add 20 to 30 million tonnes of greenhouse gas to Australia's targets while a proposed coal mining expansion in Queensland would add much more.
``The Federal Government has promised to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by between 5 and 15 per cent. These coal and CSG increases make such targets impossible,'' Mr Hutton said.
He said other nations were already talking about stopping trade with high greenhouse gas polluters and Australia had little hope of meeting its plans to reduce emissions by between 5 and 15 per cent by 2020.
Ms Robinson said gas was the most cost effective energy source capable of moving Australia to a clean-energy future.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE state's runaway coal seam gas boom will ensure a $10 billion expansion of the nation's gas transmission infrastructure over the next decade with great benefits to Queensland, the Australian Pipeline Industry Association says.
Speaking at the start of the pipeline industry's annual conference in Darwin yesterday, APIA chief executive Cheryl Cartwright said Australia was on the cusp of a multibillion-dollar infrastructure boom and Queensland was the key driver.
 She said the construction of the high-pressure gas transmission pipelines associated with Queensland's massive CSG and LNG projects would provide the main impetus for increased pipeline industry activity.
``Over the next decade, we are looking at a possible $10 billion being spent on high-pressure gas pipelines infrastructure, especially with the continued dramatic development of Queensland's coal seam gas (CSG) industry,'' Ms Cartwright said.
``That also means additional jobs and the need to ensure we continue with our valuable research into safe and efficient transport of the country's vast gas resources,'' she said.
Ms Cartwright also said her industry, which has 600 delegates at the conference, was ready for the challenge of providing that infrastructure.
``It is important for Australia that this CSG industry growth is not delayed, and our industry is keen to work with governments - state and federal - to ensure progress of such CSG development,'' she said.
``Australia has the equivalent of some 250 years' worth of natural gas resources in Queensland alone, and we should not miss this opportunity to develop these reserves, as all nations move away from coal-fired power generation.''
She said the industry recognised that Australia must develop renewable technology, but stressed that emissions could be reduced sooner rather than later if there were more encouragement to use natural gas for power generation.
``Natural gas is often described as the `transition fuel' as Australia moves to a low-emissions economy, but gas will be required well into the future as a back-up fuel for renewable energy.''
Ms Cartwright said the gas industry was predicted to undergo huge growth in the next 20 years, driven by the rise in gas-fired power generation in response to climate change issues and an LNG industry based on CSG reserves.
``It is critical to ensure that the natural gas industry is encouraged to invest in the required infrastructure so that, in the longer term, natural gas will provide base-load power in support of renewable energies and Australia will meet its emissions targets.''
She said the pipeline industry would be required to meet this demand and a rising demand for water infrastructure, as demonstrated by the development of desalination plants and the replacement of open irrigation channels with pipes.

The company said its proved and probable (2P) reserves increased from 72.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (Bcfe) to 143.1Bcfe.
 Red Fork is hoping to prove up its 2P reserves to 300 Bcfe at its East Oklahoma project in the next 12 months, and ultimately boost it up to 750Bcfe.
The US operations from Red Fork currently produce about 1.5 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the company hopes that its reserves may catch the eye of a major hoping to further develop the operations.
 We will continue to prove-up the quality of the reserves and it will be a large, very attractive asset to someone who wants to take a long-term position on gas prices,  managing director David Prentice said.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,3,"EASTERN Star Gas will begin negotiations soon with landholders and authorities about a preliminary route for its proposed 295-kilometre gas pipeline from Coolah to Newcastle.
The pipeline would supply gas from the company's Narrabri coal-seam gas fields to a proposed liquefied natural gas export terminal on Kooragang Island.
 The project is worth about $2.5 billion.
Eastern Star managing director David Casey said the preliminary route ran south-east from Coolah to Bayswater Power Station, Hexham and Kooragang Island.
Mr Casey said the company was seeking community comment about the proposed route.
 We are keen to minimise the impact on farming and other activities,  Mr Casey said.
 Personal face-to-face contact  would be made with those affected.
The company will apply to the NSW Department of Planning for the pipeline and plant.
Eastern Star has spent $25 million to acquire 24 hectares on Kooragang Island for the terminal.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"New federal Environment Minister Tony Burke has less than four weeks to familiarise himself with and approve $36 billion in proposed Queensland liquefied natural gas projects if Santos and BG Group are to avoid further delays.
Mr Burke was on the weekend shifted into the environment portfolio after previously serving as agriculture minister.
 He replaces Peter Garrett, who in July announced he would rule by October 11 on whether to approve Santos and BG's projects.
While the Queensland LNG industry is believed to be privately welcoming the appointment of Mr Burke, a former member of the Wilderness Society who hails from the Labor party's Right and who is considered more progressive than Mr Garrett, the new minister faces a tight timeÂ­table to rule on the projects.
The approval on the projects is looming as the first real test of the government's environmental credentials since Labor struck a deal with the Greens and independents to form a minority government.
Mr Garrett's original delay was prompted by concerns over the long- term impact of coal seam gas extraction on groundwater. In the coal seam gas extraction process, water is sucked out of the seams to the surface in order to release the gas trapped within the coal.
The coal seam gas-fed LNG projects proposed for development in south-east Queensland are expected to bring to surface up to 420 megaÂ­litres a day of mostly brackish groundwater, only slightly less than the entire average daily water consumption of Brisbane.
Farmers have expressed concerns over the effect the industry could have on the water table in the long term.
Bureaucrats in Canberra have continued working with Santos and BG on the environmental studies over the course of the election campaign and subsequent uncertainty over whether Labor could form government.
Santos chief executive David Knox said last week before the ministerial reshuffle was announced that Santos would work hard to ensure the October schedule was met in the event Mr Garrett was replaced as environment minister.
 We've been working with the bureaucrats in the recess period and there's been no showstoppers,  Mr Knox said.  But it is a big environmental approval â€“ we fully recognise that â€“ so we're going to work with the new environment minister as soon as he or she is appointed to basically get agreement on the proposal by October. 
Santos does have some breathing space in the timetable for its $16 billion GLNG project, with Mr Knox having earlier this year pushed the deadline for a final investment decision out to the end of this year.
 Whoever is the minister, there's certainly going to be some continuity, certainly through the bureaucrats,  Mr Knox said last week.
 This isn't about who is the environment minister, this is about proving we can do this project in an environmentally responsible way, which I firmly believe we can. 
BG had originally hoped to approve its estimated $20 billion investment by mid-2010, but has been forced to sit on its hands since Mr Garrett's decision.
The company is expected to announce a final investment decision on Queensland Curtis LNG soon after the final federal environmental approval is put in place.
Calls to Mr Burke's office were not returned.
Shares in Santos, which fell more than 11 per cent late last week after the company announced a worse than expected deal to sell 15 per cent of GLNG to French oil giant Total, recovered 18Â¢ yesterday to close at $12.37.
KEY POINTS Peter Garrett promised a decision on the projects by mid-October. Santos and BG have welcomed Tony Burke as more progressive.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ENERGY: Federal environmental approval of Santos's Gladstone liquefied natural gas plant is expected to be delayed beyond a previously set October deadline, making a 2010 final investment decision target challenging, JPMorgan says.
In a report yesterday, JPMorgan analyst Ben Wilson said he did not expect new Environment Minister Tony Burke to stick to an October 11 decision date set by his predecessor Peter Garrett for rulings on Santos's coal-seam gas export project and another planned by BG Group.
 ``Burke seems to have a definite consultative approach which would tend to indicate that he will take his time on the first major decision he will be tasked with as Environment Minister,'' Mr Wilson said. ``If the federal approval process slips beyond October, then Santos's target of a GLNG Train 1 final investment decision by the end of 2010 will be very challenging.''
Mr Burke, whose appointment was announced last weekend, is yet to receive formal advice on the two multi-billion-dollar approvals.
He is expected to be briefed this week.
The two projects plan to produce coal-seam gas from thousands of small onshore wells in Queensland.
The gas will be piped to Gladstone's Curtis Island, where it will be frozen for export.
Mr Garrett delayed a decision on the two projects after the election was called, citing concerns about the effects of the projects on groundwater in the Great Artesian Basin and on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.
Mr Wilson said Mr Burke's previous role as agriculture minister could mean he is more sympathetic to Queensland farmers' concerns about the potential effects of coal-seam gas extraction on the water table.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"All the signs indicate Korea Gas is getting even closer to signing its major gas off-take agreement with Adelaide-based Santos.
Such an agreement, of course, also pushes Santos further towards an equity raising of more than $2â€Šbillion to fund the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project, which along with QR National's $3 billion-plus intial public offering is among the most anticipated equity capital market event of the year.
 Kogas is said to be on the cusp of buying a 10 per cent stake in GLNG as part of a major long-term LNG offtake agreement worth tens of billions of dollars.
Kogas has been busily putting together funding in the past few days, yesterday issuing 70 billion won ($64.7 million) of bonds maturing in 2020 at a coupon rate of 4.5 per cent. That follows last week's issue of 200 million Swiss francs ($213.5 million) of bonds maturing in 2015 and a commitment at the time to issue a further 100 million Swiss francs' worth.
The raisings would collectively leave Kogas on the cusp of securing enough financing to buy its GLNG stake. French giant Total last week bought a 15 per cent stake from Santos for $650 million, meaning Kogas would be looking at about $430 million for a 10th of a stake.
A deal with Kogas would leave volumes from GLNG fully contracted â€“ a luxury Grant King at Origin would love, with his Australia Pacific LNG joint venture yet to secure a single customer at this stage.
As for QR, another hurdle to the float was removed yesterday after the National Competition Council effectively ticked off on the company's access arrangements. The government is preparing to release pre-marketing research and advertising as early as next week.
The NCC decision is a boost for the process as QR rival Asciano had earlier this year applied to have pricing and access to the QR network put under federal control. Asciano had criticised the state regime, saying it was ineffective and could get even worse once QR was privatised. But the NCC said it would recommend the current access regime be certified as an effective regime for a period of 10 years.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"Greenpeace says the state and federal governments should reject a plan to build a new power station in Victoria's Latrobe Valley.
Energy company HRL has submitted a plan to build a power station at Morwell that would use a combination of natural gas and gas derived from coal.
 HRL says says the station would emit less carbon than any other Australian coal-fired power station.
John Hepburn from Greenpeace says the Federal Government should step in and prove it is serious about reducing carbon emissions.
 Energy, up until this point around the country, has been a state issue but ... climate change does not adhere to the borders of states,  he said.
 It's an issue that has national and international importance and so if the Victorian Government is not going to regulate to make sure that new coal power stations aren't going to be built then we think there's a role for the Federal Government to step in. 
The chairman of the Advance Morwell group, John Guy, supports the HRL proposal.
He says it will create construction jobs and ongoing employment.
 We've been briefed by the proponents of this proposal. Overall it's good for the Latrobe Valley region. If it creates jobs that's a plus for the region,  he said.
The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) says it will consider public opinion when deciding whether to approve the HRL proposal.
People can see the plan on the EPA's website.
The EPA's Gippsland manager, Elizabeth Radcliffe, says there will also be a community information session at Traralgon next Thursday.
 EPA has four months to make a decision on the application for works approval, so our statutory deadline is actually the 2nd of January. It's a big job to assess the application and we're very keen to have input from the community as a whole,  she said.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,3,"With more than 550 local residents attending the seven coal seam gas and liquefied gas community information forums held throughout regional and Surat Basin areas, the State Government is pleased with the response it has received from attendees.
For the past six weeks, State Government officials including treasurer Andrew Fraser, Natural Resources minister Stephen Robertson and Department of Environment and Resource Management co-ordinator general John Bradley have been presenting a range of information.
 These include updating local residents on new laws, management programs and topics of interest related to the coal seam gas and liquefied natural gas industries.
Last week Chinchilla hosted the final scheduled forum which saw topics including groundwater management, CSG water management, strategic cropping land, land access and compensation and compliance and monitoring discussed.
Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation CSG Engagement (Suart Basin) director Bill Date said generally forum feedback proved positive.
â€œOverwhelmingly the majority of feedback was positive,â€? he said.
â€œWe would ask at the end of each forum if landholders would leave with a better understanding.
â€œA vast majority put their hand up.
â€œWe've also received emails and verbally positive feedback on the forums.â€?
He said the forums were a great opportunity to share views and ideas with government officers, who are directly involved in developing and enforcing the polices and laws related to CSG activities.
â€œA lot of good work is being done dealing with industry issues and the forums were about telling landholders where we're at.
Not everyone was left with a feeling of contentment, with Western Alliance group members not satisfied with the forums.
Western Alliance member Scott Collins said the forums did not provide the reassurance Tara residential estate owner were looking for.
â€œThey're just saying the same old stuff,â€? he said.
â€œWe got nothing out of it; it's the same old spin.
â€œWhat about the residents and the dangerous conditions?
â€œThey're (coal seam gas companies) still going to destroy our living environment and the noise is extraordinary.â€?
Mr Scott said while the forums had provided some reassurance for the farmers, he still felt they were back to square one.
â€œWe're all rural residential guinea pigs.â€?
Meanwhile Mr Date has suggested an eighth forum will be held but information related to the forum was not available.

 QGC gas field social performance manager Tony Heidrich said QGC recognised the increased demand these services have and will experience due to the recent and future growth of the region.
â€œThese centres provide a wide range of vital functions to the community and we are delighted to help them deliver these services and develop their capacity to meet future needs,â€? he said.
The family support centres provide a vast range of services to the community including computer, internet access and administration, community development, family support, child care co-ordination, aged care programs, rural family support and adult eduction programs.
Many centres are also Centrelink agencies and host visiting services such as Legal Aid and other professionals.
Thanks to the funding, centres in Chinchilla and Miles will hire more people to help with administrative functions, which will free up other staff to focus on service delivery.
Murilla Community Centre manager Cecily Brockhurst said the centre was a one-stop-shop for information and support.
â€œStaff at the centre reported increased client contacts and enquiries over the past 12 months due to the number of significant projects and major developments in the Miles area,â€? she said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"With a key executive taking the reins of the LNG project, the French major is signalling its determination to pick up the pace, writes Angela Macdonald-Smith.
French oil giant Total, fresh from a $860 million investment in Santos's Gladstone liquefied natural gas venture in Queensland, is parachuting in one of its key global project experts to revive momentum at its second major Australian venture, the $23 billion Ichthys LNG project.
 The secondment of Antoine Serceau â€“ senior vice-president of projects at Total subsidiary Total E&P Australia â€“ to the new Perth-based role of project director at Ichthys underlines the French major's determination to develop two world-scale LNG projects in tandem in Australia without further delays.
The combined cost of the two projects for Total â€“ the junior partner to Japan's Inpex in Ichthys LNG â€“ is expected to be at least $9Â billion. Mr Serceau, who was at the helm of the construction of the Girassol crude oil project in Angola, the first deep-water oil development in sub-Saharan Africa, has more recently been involved with the development of Total's $US4.5Â billion ($4.9Â billion) Yemen LNG project, which started deliveries last year.
His expertise as a specialist on major project development will help drive the Ichthys venture in northern Australia towards its final investment decision, set for late next year, a spokesman for Inpex in Perth said. Total is a 24Â per cent partner in Ichthys but has substantially more LNG operating experience.
Total, a major LNG player in the Atlantic Basin, has been seeking greater exposure to the fast-growing, favourably priced Asian LNG market where its only producing interest is in the Bontang project in Indonesia. Output at Bontang is in decline and due to end in about 2020.
 It's a country we want to grow in,  Total E&P Australia managing director Mike Sangster told The Australian Financial Review.
Ichthys's timetable has slowed due to complex engineering on massive offshore facilities and an almost 900-kilometre pipeline required from the gasfields in the Browse Basin to the onshore plant in Darwin.
The appointment of Mr Serceau, who takes up the role on October 1, comes as Inpex steps up LNG marketing and financing efforts for Ichthys. Despite this, the venture's lack of LNG customers is weighing on sentiment. Some observers believe Inpex should offer LNG buyers more equity in the project to encourage them to sign up.
Inpex has been offering only a 1 per cent stake in the project for every 1 million tonnes a year of offtake, much less than rivals such as Chevron's Wheatstone and Santos's Gladstone venture, the regional head of oil and gas at CLSA in Hong Kong, David Hewitt, said. The Gladstone deal, under which Total has bought a 20Â per cent stake in the $16Â billion project and will buy 1.5Â million tonnes a year of LNG,  should be another signpost to go down that path , he said.
Environmental objections to Ichthys also need to be overcome. More than 1000 public submissions were received on the project's draft environmental impact statement by last Friday's deadline.
Responding to the uncertainty, Northern Territory Resources Minister Kon Vatskalis said yesterday that after talking to top Inpex managers in Japan, government officials and project financiers he was confident the project would proceed on its latest timeline.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"SANTOS MELBOURNE, Sept 17 AAP - Gas giant Santos Ltd is bolstering its books, as the $15 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) joint venture approaches crunch time on funding.
The company on Friday announced it would issue 650 million euro ($A907.9 million) of subordinated notes to strengthen its balance sheet, ahead of a final investment decision on the coal seam gas project, expected within months.
 Although the estimated cost of the project has not been revealed, it has widely been tipped to cost about $15 billion, well up on original estimates of $7.7 billion.
Santos recently sold a 20 per cent stake in GLNG to French energy company Total for $650 million and now has a 45 per cent stake in the project, with Malaysia's Petronas holding 35 per cent.
It has also flagged the possibility of selling more of the project.
Pengana Capital fund manager Tim Schroeders said the new offering from Santos looked like a fairly competitive deal.
 The closer they get to building it (GLNG), the more the costs become a reality, and they are unlikely to move downwards,  Mr Schroeders said.
 I don't think it is a balance sheet that is optimal at the moment, but they clearly have a number of irons in the fire in terms of sources of funds and they will use those. 
A final investment decision on GLNG is expected later this year, with shipments from the project starting in early 2014.
After settlement of the hybrid notes and receipt of its recent sell-down in the project to Total, Santos will have about $6 billion in cash and committed corporate facilities, it said.
Further funds could be generated from another selldown of equity in GLNG, and from its base businesses, Santos said.
The company said the hybrid notes will be classified as equity by credit agency Standard and Poor's, and will not hurt its credit rating or dilute its share base.
The hybrid note can be redeemed by Santos after seven years for either another hybrid offering or a different equity instrument such as a share issuance, but not with debt.
It will accrue fixed coupons at a rate of 8.25 per cent each year for the first seven years and thereafter on a floating rate basis, including a one per cent step-up. It will also mature in 60 years.
The notes are a step towards generating funds to pay for the multi-billion Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) project, in which Santos has a 45 per cent stake.
Santos chief financial Peter Wasow said the issue showed Santos could source capital from a diverse range of sources on attractive terms.
At 1409 AEST shares in Santos were up 50 cents, or 3.95 per cent, at $13.15.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"AUSTRALIA'S next giant liquefied natural gas project, Chevron's planned $20 billion Wheatstone venture, could be underpinned by an offtake and equity deal with China, the world's biggest energy market.
Chevron Australia said yesterday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with China's dominant oil and gas player, China National Petroleum Corporation, to ``pursue joint opportunities'' related to development and gas offtake from Wheatstone.
 It is understood a binding deal, if signed, would establish CNPC as a cornerstone buyer from Wheatstone, possibly allowing Chevron to expand the project from an initial two trains, or processing units, to as many as six.
Chevron chairman and chief executive John Watson told The Wall Street Journal that commercial terms remained to be determined but that gas being sold from other Australian liquefied natural gas plants was being sold at ``oil-linked pricing''.
``We've been very satisfied with that pricing. I've got no reason to believe we won't continue to get good pricing,'' he said.
The deal signed in China also provides for Chevron to work with CNPC on oil and gas exploration in China, allowing greater co-operation and exchange of skills.
The MOU is a major step forwards for Chevron as it aims to give the go-ahead to Wheatstone by next year.
Chevron late last year signed a record $90bn deal with Tokyo Electric Power Co to supply gas from the Wheatstone project, which is expected to create 6500 jobs at peak construction and involve local spending of $15bn.
As part of the deal, Tokyo Electric will take a 15 per cent stake in Chevron's share of the Wheatstone field licences and an 11.25 per cent stake in LNG processing facilities to be built near Onslow, in WA's Pilbara region.
More than $500bn worth of Australian LNG has been sold to Asian buyers under long-term agreements over the past two years, including about $200bn from Chevron's other major gas project, Gorgon.
Gorgon was approved one year ago this week and is under construction on Barrow Island, off WA's Pilbara coast.
Chevron has recently been engaged in a duel with Perth-based Woodside Petroleum for exploration supremacy in Western Australia's Carnarvon Basin. Most analysts believe the American company is in the lead, thanks to a series of major discoveries.
Chevron's agreement with CNPC will allow for collaboration opportunities in the Chevron-operated WA-205-P permit area, in the highly prospective Carnarvon Basin.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"ORIGIN Energy's audacious plans to import Papua New Guinea electricity across the Torres Strait parallel ExxonMobil's failed scheme to import PNG gas to Queensland through a pipeline.
Just four years ago Exxon was set on importing gas into Queensland, where now international majors are racing to export the state's vast reserves of coal-seam gas.
 Exxon and its local partners Oil Search, Santos and AGL, abandoned the $5.5 billion PNG gas pipeline project in early 2007, before construction started.
The main reason, according to Oil Search managing director Peter Botten, was that liquefied natural gas prices had been sent soaring by Asian demand.
``Back in 2003, 2004, the North West Shelf was selling gas (LNG) at $3 to $3.50 a gigajoule, but over three or four years the price being received had jumped to $US10 to $US12,'' Mr Botten said.
``And Queensland was still sitting there at $3 to $4.''
With companies ramping up production there was also little prospect of tightness emerging in the Australian market to boost prices.
``We had a number of customers and we were price-competitive with coal-seam gas but the prevalence of coal-seam gas and the growing industry wasn't going to help,'' he said.
Inflation didn't help either, with the estimated cost of the project jumping from $3.5bn in 2002 to $5.5bn in 2006.
Exxon and Oil Search have instead embarked on the $US15bn PNG LNG project, which was given board approval last year and is aiming to export its first LNG in 2014.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"CONCERNS that Chinese domestic shale gas production will hit demand for Australian liquefied natural gas are growing, with Deutsche Bank the latest group to warn that the Asian giant might not need to import as much gas as previously expected.
In a global review of its LNG supply and demand outlook, Deutsche said that while it was still bullish on Chinese demand, the prospect of shale gas production from China meant not as much gas was expected to be imported.
 This was expected to impact Queensland's burgeoning coal-seam gas export industry more than the conventional LNG projects planned off the nation's northwest because Japanese and Korean users favour the tried and tested offshore methods of production and will continue to need more imports.
The Deutsche report comes a week after Macquarie released a report saying lower forecast Chinese demand growth for LNG after 2020 because of shale gas and Russian pipeline imports could hit Australian projects.
The development of shale gas extraction technology over the past decade has dramatically changed the market outlook for the US, which has turned from an expected gas importer to a well-supplied land with low gas prices.
Deutsche analyst John Hirjee said that while Asian demand growth could see tightness in the LNG markets return to 2016, beyond this there was a potential excess of supply, depending on how many of the planned LNG projects in Australia got up.
``We see an increasing race to secure a dwindling customer base between LNG projects utilising conventional gas reserves on Australia's west coast, and unconventional CSG-to-LNG projects in eastern Australia,'' Mr Hirjee said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"SANTOS'S $900 million hybrid bond raising is expected to reduce the amount the company will need to raise from the sharemarket to build the Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project to about $1 billion.
Santos chief executive David Knox said every dollar raised in the hybrid subordinated note issue would represent a $1 decrease in any equity raising.
 The bond issue, previously reported in The Australian, beat market expectations and sent Santos shares 45c higher to $13.10. The hybrid nature of the issue means debt-rating agency Standard & Poor's is treating it as an equity raising -- meaning it will not weigh on Santos's BBB+ rating. Citi analyst Mark Greenwood said if Santos was successful in selling down an extra 5 per cent in the project to Korea Gas or another party, any raising could be limited to $1.1bn.
``This is another important milestone towards a final investment decision for GLNG,'' Mr Greenwood said.
Santos has not confirmed it will need to make an equity raising, saying only that if one is required it would reward existing shareholders. Chief financial officer Peter Wasow said the company had other options for funding and reducing costs of GLNG, including asset leasing and third-party ownership of the pipeline that would carry the coal-seam gas from inland Queensland to Gladstone.
Merrill Lynch applauded the note issue, without which it was expected Santos would have to go to the sharemarket for $2bn.
``Today's announcement will clearly reduce the size of any potential capital raising reducing this overhang on the stock and in our view should be viewed positively,'' the bank said yesterday.

Some analysts speculate it could be delayed because of the reshuffle by Prime Minister Julia Gillard of her Cabinet, with Peter Garrett replaced as Environment Minister by Tony Burke.
After settlement of the hybrid notes and receipt of its recent selldown in the project to Total, Santos will have about $6 billion in cash and committed corporate facilities, it said.
Further funds could be generated from another selldown of equity in GLNG, and from its base businesses, Santos said.
It said the hybrid notes will be classified as equity by credit agency Standard & Poor's, and will not hurt its credit rating or dilute its share base.
Shares in Santos closed up 45c, or 3.6 per cent, at $13.10 on the ASX yesterday.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"OIL and gas giant Santos has achieved a major coup by securing $900 million in financing for its flagship Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project that neither dilutes its shares nor counts against its debt gearing, the company said yesterday.
``This is a world first,'' managing director David Knox said.
 ``We believe nobody before this has done a hybrid that is 100 per cent credited as equity in the eyes of Standard & Poor's.''
Mr Knox was speaking after the company announced a subsidiary had issued $650 million ($906 million) in subordinated notes with the hybrids counting as equity for the company's credit rating.
``It builds momentum in the GLNG project,'' said Mr Knox who was in a celebratory mood yesterday.
Scottish-born Mr Knox , his wife, Clare, and their son, Cameron, became Australian citizens yesterday.
He said Santos now had $6 billion that was ready to finance GLNG.
``(That's) $4 billion in cash and $2 billion in credit when the Total transaction and this transaction are complete,'' he said. ``So, we have a very strong balance sheet to fund GLNG.''
Last week, Santos announced that French company Total had taken a 15 per cent stake in the GLNG project for $650 million.
The coal seam gas project had also secured more than $100 billion of contracts, making it one of the largest export deals in Australia's history.
Santos has yet to publish an estimate of the cost of building GLNG but analysts forecast it will cost about $16 billion.
Santos now has a 45 per cent share, meaning its funding commitment would be about $1 billion more than it has already secured.
The hybrid issue demonstrated Santos's ability to source capital from a diverse range of sources on attractive terms, Santos chief financial officer Peter Wasow said.
Santos is awaiting federal environmental assessment of GLNG. It aims to make a final investment decision by year end if approvals are given.
``We believe the timetable is unchanged for an October decision,'' Mr Knox said.
The market responded well to the funding deal with shares lifting 3.6 per cent to close at $13.10.

FEARS that Santos would require a huge equity issue to fund its share of development costs for its now 45 per cent owned Gladstone liquefied natural gas project have eased after the group pulled in â‚¬650 million ($900 million) from a hybrid notes issue.
 Santos shares had one of their best days on the sharemarket as a result, rising 45Â¢ to $13.10.
The shares had been under pressure following the recent sale to the large French oil company Total of a 20 per cent stake in GLNG for $867 million - 15 per cent from Santos and 5 per cent from Malaysia's Petronas.
The $650 million to Santos under that deal disappointed the market and raised questions about how Santos would fully fund itself for its remaining 45 per cent of the GLNG project; one that has not been priced by the joint venture but one that analysts reckon could cost $15 billion all-up (with Santos's share $6.75 billion).
Before the euro hybrid note issue, the assumption was that Santos could be forced to embark on a highly discounted or dilutive equity issue to ensure it was fully funded for the GLNG project, with a final investment decision on the first  processing train  due by the end of the year.
Santos said yesterday that existing cash and liquid facilities - following settlement of the hybrid issue and the receipt of the GLNG sell-down proceeds from Total - was now about $6 billion in cash and committed corporate facilities. The chief financial officer, Peter Wasow, said the hybrid note issue had been given 100 per cent equity classification from Standard & Poor's. As a result, the hybrid  directly reduces the amount of any potential equity that may be required, on a dollar for dollar basis, to maintain Santos' BBB+ credit rating. 
To further strengthen its balance sheet before the go-ahead for GLNG, Santos could further sell down part of its equity in the project. The market expects a deal on that score with Kogas of South Korea, with an accompanying gas sales agreement as well.
UBS acted as sole structuring adviser and joint book-builder on the hybrid note issue.
 This is a watershed transaction for Santos and hybrid markets generally,  said the director of global capital markets at UBS, Barry Sharkey.
 Whilst the euro hybrid market is not open to everyone, it does demonstrate the positive tone in global credit markets at the moment.
 An increasing number of offshore investors are now willing to invest in structured product or initiate coverage on debut/rare Australian corporates, in an effort to achieve portfolio diversification and enhanced yield in a low interest rate environment. Woolworths and Asciano's $US bond issues this week are further examples of this trend. 
The hybrid security is euro denominated, has a subordinated ranking, matures after 60 years and can be redeemed by Santos after seven years.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,3,"WOODSIDEâ€™S controversial $30 billion proposed gas hub at James Price Point on Western Australiaâ€™s Kimberley Coast will be the first real test of the partnership between the Greens and the minority Labor government, the businessman Geoff Cousins, who is campaigning against the project, says.
The Greens have agreed to ensure supply and confidence in the Gillard government but Mr Cousins said they would have to abandon the partnership if the government approved the massive liquefied natural gas facility at James Price Point.
 â€˜â€˜They couldnâ€™t have credibility and say, â€˜We oppose it, but we donâ€™t really care if the federal environment minister goes ahead and approves it,â€™ â€™â€™ Mr Cousins said.
Mr Cousins said while the Greens might compromise with the government on the proposed Minerals Resource Rent Tax, for example, saving the Kimberley Coast from such an inappropriate LNG development was a core environment issue.
â€˜â€˜With a leader like Bob Brown, on an issue like this, they would have to do whatever they need to do in order to change the government. I donâ€™t see how they could remain in a partnership with Labor, if Labor sought to approve a project of this kind.
â€˜â€˜They would have to walk away from the partnership.â€™â€™
James Price Point is the West Australian governmentâ€™s preferred site for the proposed hub, which would process liquefied natural gas from the Browse Basin.
This month the Premier, Colin Barnett, announced he would move to compulsorily acquire the land after the breakdown of extended negotiations with indigenous groups including the Kimberley Land Council (KLC), which last year struck an in-principle deal to support the project.
But the agreement unravelled amid division in the indigenous community. The Aboriginal law man Joseph Roe has lodged a native title claim over the land and is suing the land council in the Federal Court.
Mr Roeâ€™s case was dismissed by the court last month for a lack of legal standing, but he is seeking leave to appeal. His allegations could form the basis of a challenge to the Premierâ€™s compulsory acquisition process.
The new federal environment minister, Tony Burke, has final say over the James Price Point project, which requires approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
The site is part of a strategic assessment of heritage values as a precursor to possible inclusion on the national heritage list.
A number of environmental groups held initial briefings with Mr Burke this week and it is understood the James Price Point development was a key issue.
An Australian Conservation Foundation campaigner, Denise Boyd, said the group asked Mr Burke to commence the West Kimberley heritage listing within 30 days, raised the issue of compulsory acquisition and asked for consideration of alternatives such as offshore processing or a pipeline to an existing plant at Karratha.
Mr Cousins, a Telstra director who was formerly Optus Vision chief executive, ran a high-profile campaign against the forestry company Gunnsâ€™s proposed $2.2 billion pulp mill at Bell Bay, in the Tamar Valley in Tasmania.
Siding with Mr Roe, he said he predicted there would be a similar Gunns-style campaign targeting Woodside and its shareholders and joint venture partners including Shell, Chevron, BHP and BP if a political resolution could not be found.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,3,"BROWSE CANBERRA, Sept 19 AAP - The Australian Greens will call on the federal government to investigate alternative sites for a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) development in WA.
State premier Colin Barnett earlier this month announced he would move to compulsorily acquire land at James Price Point for the $30 billion Woodside Petroleum-led project, after negotiations with the Kimberley Land Council for an indigenous land-use agreement stalled.
 Greens leader Bob Brown said the dispute over the Browse Basin gas reserves was a  very contentious  issue.
 The premier of Western Australia is now riding roughshod over the indigenous people with a compulsory purchase,  he told Network Ten on Sunday.
 There are alternatives to that site and they ... are ones we will be expecting the federal government to explore. 
Senator Brown said he believed a better place for the LNG development would be found.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"When the chief executive of the world's biggest mining company speaks, everyone stops to listen. That was never more evident than last week, when BHP Billiton boss Marius Kloppers called for the early introduction of a price on carbon pollution, before any international accord is set up.
It wasn't a new message, at least as far as natural gas suppliers AGL Energy and Origin Energy were concerned. They have been pushing and preparing for an emissions trading system for several years.
 But they are among those set to benefit most from the gradual switch from coal to gas as a fuel for baseload power generation that would be triggered by putting a price on carbon.
The same can't be said for BHP Billiton, which is among the world's biggest exporters of coal and is a huge power consumer for its energy-Â­intensive aluminium operations, and therefore has a lot more to lose.
Citigroup names Infigen Energy, AGL and Origin as the main beneficiaries of carbon pricing, and Virgin Blue, BlueScope Steel and Qantas Airways as those that will be most negatively affected.
The net present value impact on BHP Billiton is less than 1 per cent of its market value, even assuming a carbon price of $25 a tonne in 2012, Â­rising to $50 by 2019.
Some of the loudest voices calling for a switch to gas, among them Origin managing director Grant King, AGL managing director Michael Fraser and Santos chief David Knox, will be glad to see the debate widened beyond the gas supply sector, which could be accused of self-interest.
Of course, BHP Billiton, given its gas and uranium interests, would see some benefits in parts of its portfolio. More broadly, the Business Council of Australia has acknowledged that some sort of emissions trading system is inevitable as the lowest-cost way to cut carbon emissions. But there is as yet no string of mining and industrial companies lining up to support Kloppers, who Â­isâ€Šâ€Šadamant that Australia needs to move early towards a lower-carbon economy or risk compromising its competitiveness.
AGL's Fraser last week estimated the economic cost of a delay until 2013 in regulatory certainty at $2.1Â billion a year by 2020. The reason: wholesale power prices would be 13 per cent, or $8.60 a megawatt-hour higher in 2020 than if we had that certainty now.
His argument is that companies would minimise capital investment amid the uncertainty, even if it led to increased operating costs and sub-Â­optimal investment in plants.
The problem centres on baseload plants that provide continuous power, and that means those using coal. Â­Placing a $30 per tonne cost on carbon reverses the economics of new generation in favour of gas, according to consulting firm ACIL Tasman.
But none of it will happen without the regulation. Hence the stalemate.
The evidence of stalled investment is clear. In the past 12 months, the power sector's forecast capital expenditure for the next five years on generation assets has more than halved to $8.2Â billion. The $10Â billion drop was due overwhelmingly to the uncertainty on carbon policy, says the chief executive of the Energy Supply Association of Australia, Brad Page.
Hong Kong-owned energy supplier TRUenergy has more than $3 billion worth of proposed investments in gas-fired baseload power in Victoria and NSW on hold awaiting that clarity, managing director Richard McIndoe says. Origin will hang back on an investment of hundreds of millions to upgrade its Mortlake power station to baseload. The project is now under construction as a peaking plant.
A closer look at the figures is instructive. The power generation sector contributes 40 per cent of AustÂ­ralia's greenhouse gas emissions, and coal provides 85 per cent of energy output. Of that, almost one-third is the dirtier brown coal. Gas, when used in combined-cycle gas turbines, can cut emissions by up to 70 per cent compared with coal, so switching plants to gas would make a big difference.
The nuclear power option is there, but would be costly, controversial and not at all immediate.
As Santos CEO Knox points out, switching baseload power to gas would in any case achieve close to 70â€Šper cent of the carbon cuts that nuclear power would deliver in eastern Australia.
Even allowing for transitional arrangements for coal-fired generators â€“ itself a prickly issue â€“ putting a cost on carbon would hasten the closure of the dirtiest plan and International Power's Hazelwood power station in the La Trobe valley is in the front line.
Hazelwood and TRUenergy's Yallourn generators together account for 40 per cent of Victoria's power supply, and emit up to 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of power produced. That's more than four times as much as TRUenergy's gas-fuelled Tallawarra plant near Wollongong, NSW.
But industry leaders agree that in the current policy vacuum, no company could ever get board approval for any investment in a baseload power plant â€“ neither gas nor coal. As Fraser puts it, it's like being  caught halfway down the cricket pitch .
Industry is in limbo, says Citigroup's Elaine Prior.
 It seems risky to build high-emission plants, given the likelihood of future carbon costs, but it may be risky to overinvest in low-emission technologies. 
Estimates of when Australia needs new baseload power supply vary from 2015 to 2018. But any plant, whether coal or gas, takes at least five years to build, and the risk of power shortages is increasing as the investment hiatus drags on.
Meeting peak power demand is not so much of a problem. Investment in gas-fired peaking plants will continue, driven by an increasing role in balancing the intermittent generation of renewable energy. And the federal government's 20 per cent Renewable Energy Target for 2020 is doing its bit, by driving a forecast $25 billion investment in renewable power projects, mostly wind energy.
But without a carbon price, AustÂ­ralia's minimum target of a 5 per cent cut in emissions from 2000 levels by 2020 looks like a stretch.
Under a business-as-usual scenario, Australia's emissions are projected to grow to 45 per cent above 2000 levels by 2020, so the minimum 5 per cent reduction target is far from modest.
The Renewable Energy Target will help, but only in limiting emissions growth to 28 per cent by 2020. The cost of cutting carbon emissions through wind and peaking gas is about $40 a tonne more expensive than substituting gas for coal, Origin calculates.
And while energy efficiency measures will help slow demand for new power plants, they will do little to actually cut emissions.
But as industry consensus gradually grows on the need for climate action, there is little agreement what form that should take.
The idea that AGL's Fraser floated last week of a limited emissions trading scheme just for power generation has received only cautious support. Kloppers suggests a combination of carbon tax, land-use measures and a limited trading system.
Whatever the mechanism, the issues of compensation for coal-fired power generators and for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries will be as thorny as ever. The stakes are high â€“ Australia's commodity exports and its reputation as a secure destination for investment.
Also up for debate is how high the carbon price needs to be to bring about change. Origin's King argues that a price of $20 to $40 a tonne is needed to encourage investment in new gas-fired baseload plants. AGL's Fraser puts it at about $30.
That would indicate that the Greens proposal for an interim $20 tax on carbon would do little to help immediately. But as King has argued, it would at least get the cost of carbon on the boardroom agenda for every company in the country.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"United States oil and gas major ConocoPhillips has put its stake in the Caldita and Barossa gasfields in the Timor Sea up for sale, raising another question about the expansion plans for its Darwin liquefied natural gas plant.
A range of industry sources have confirmed to The Australian Financial Review that ConocoPhillips has put its 60 per cent stake in the two gasfields up for sale as part of the company's $US10 billion in global asset sales aimed at strengthening its balance sheet.
 After Adelaide-based Santos said earlier that it intended to sell its 40â€Šâ€Šper cent stake in the two fields, any buyer would have the opportunity for an outright purchase.
Caldita and Barossa were originally earmarked as potential sources of supply for a second LNG train, or processing line, for Darwin LNG, where the existing train is fed with gas from the Bayu Undan field.
While Barossa and Caldita contain as much gas as Bayu Undan, with around 3.4 trillion cubic feet of gas, the fields' economics are hurt by the fact that they carry a much higher carbon dioxide content (12 per cent versus 4 per cent at Bayu Undan) and dramatically fewer associated liquids (17 million barrels compared with 242 million barrels).
There has been plenty of corporate activity in the Timor Sea in recent years.
Back in March, US company Magellan Petroleum agreed to pay up to $200 million for Santos's 40 per cent stake in the 6.6 trillion cubic feet Evans Shoal gasfield. Assuming a deal could be struck at Caldita-Barossa on similar terms to Santos' Evans Shoal deal, a 100 per cent stake in the two fields could fetch around $250 million. Caldita and Barossa could feasibly fetch even more, given Evans Shoal is 25 per cent carbon dioxide.
French company GDF Suez has also been active in the Timor Sea, buying a 60 per cent interest in Santos's Petrel, Tern and Frigate fields for up to $US370 with the expectation of using the fields to support a radical floating LNG project.
Thai group PTTEP â€“ the company behind last year's Montara disaster â€“ has also been acquiring assets in the region.
The Timor Sea has emerged in the past 18 months as the global hub of the emerging floating LNG industry, due in part to its calm waters and the abundance of undeveloped gasfields.
In addition to GDF Suez's plans, Woodside Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips are proposing to use one of Shell's massive under-construction floating LNG vessels to develop the Greater Sunrise field between Australia and East Timor. Shell also plans to use floating LNG at its nearby Prelude field.
The potential sale of ConocoPhillips' stake in Caldita and Barossa will raise questions over when and how the company could add a second train to Darwin LNG.
The recent Poseidon discovery off northern Western Australia by ConocoPhillips and Karoon Gas Australia has been suggested as a potential source of gas for Darwin LNG, but the field is in its early days of assessment and several years away from being realistically considered for Darwin.
ConocoPhillips has been selling off assets in the past year after building up substantial debt levels with a series of major acquisitions just before the global financial crisis. Those acquisitions included its purchase of a 50 per cent stake in Origin Energy's Queensland coal-seam gas assets for up to $9.2 billion.
KEY POINTS Two Timor Sea gasfields could be up for outright purchase after Santos and ConocoPhillips talk of selling. The two fields were originally earmarked for supply to a second Darwin LNG train.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Arrow Energy, newly taken over by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina, has flagged a slower schedule for its $20Â billion liquefied natural gas project in Queensland and signalled that a final investment decision may not be reached until 2013.
The new timeline is about a year behind the 2012 date widely assumed in the market and indicates production will not begin until about 2017. But Arrow's new chief executive Andrew Faulkner said it was important to get the project right.
  There is too much opportunity for value destruction by rushing, while the potential for value enhancement, if we take the time to get it right up-front, is huge,  he said.
He shrugged off speculation about a consolidation between rival LNG ventures in Gladstone, emphasising Arrow's  enviable  position of having all the LNG from the planned first 8Â million tonnes-a-year-phase sold to its two shareholders.  I'm not racing for limited market; I have my market offtake already, so if I take a bit longer that's absolutely fine,  he said.
The Shell-PetroChina venture is understood to previously have been in advanced talks with Santosto combine their two Gladstone LNG projects allowing for potential cost savings, estimated by Santos chief executiveDavid Knox, of $2Â billion. But Mr Knox recently played down the prospects of any deal in the short term, while Shell Australia chairwoman Ann Pickard has lately emphasised the benefits of co-operation rather than consolidation.
Mr Faulkner said Arrow was  open  to the potential of obvious synergies between the four LNG projects being developed on Curtis Island. But Arrow was continuing to pursue a stand-alone project, backed by its parents and a firm market for its LNG, he said. British gas giant BG Group and an Origin Energy-ConocoPhillips venture are also planning LNG plants on Curtis Island.
 How consolidation plays out remains to be seen,  said Mr Faulkner. Meanwhile, Arrow was building up its gas reserves and aimed to add more than 1000Â petajoules a year to its 6150PJ of proven and probable reserves. That would require increasing the number of drilling rigs at its fields in the Bowen and Surat basins to between 10 and 15, up from one or two earlier this year.
Arrow also expected to almost double its staff numbers in the next two years, from about 470 at present, Mr Faulkner said.
The company was yet to estimate the project cost but Citigroup put it at about $20Â billion.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"SANTOS By Nicole Stevens
SYDNEY, Sept 23 AAP - Santos says Asia's demand for natural gas will more than double in the next 15 years, offering significant opportunities for Australian exporters.
 Santos says gas demand will rise in the established markets of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as well as the mega-markets of China and India.
But the biggest driver will be in the emerging markets of Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
 It is not just China and India where energy demand is expanding,  Santos chief executive David Knox said at a conference on Thursday.
 The established markets of Japan and South Korea, and the emerging markets of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are set for sustained periods of growing demand. 
Between now and 2035 Asia is expected to account for 48 per cent of global population growth and 64 per cent of growth in primary energy consumption, Mr Knox said.
 Notwithstanding the growth of China and India ... it is the emerging markets ... that will be the biggest drivers in Asian gas consumption over the next 25 years. 
Mr Knox said coal was forecast to be the dominant fuel in 2035, accounting for 50 per cent of the fuel mix with gas at 11 per cent.
 We would argue that's an under-representation of the role natural gas can play as a cleaner burning fuel,  he said.
 Any policy shift towards cutting carbon emissions is likely to sharply accelerate the growth outlook for natural gas.
Mr Knox said every percentage increase of gas in Asia's fuel mix would equate to 62 mtpa of LNG imports in 2035.
 In an Australian context, that's four Gorgons in the West, or more than 15 trains at Gladstone in the East,  he said.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,3,"QGC has opened a new community office in Chinchilla boosting its presence in the Western Downs region.
Located at 81 Heeney Street, the office will provide the community with information on QGC's coal seam gas operations.
 It will also be a place where job seekers can discuss career opportunities as well as an administrative base for QGC's operations around the local area.
The site will also include an upstairs office complex for QGC employees.
QGC Gasfields Social Performance manager Tony Heidrich said he hoped a prominent presence would help strengthen relations with the community.
â€œQGC is committed to working with the local community as we grow our existing domestic gas operations and develop QCLNG,â€? he said.
â€œConsultation is vital to finding out what the community expects from us in the gas fields and we hope this office will become a key point of contact for the community.â€?
Mr Heidrich said consultation already conducted throughout the region had proved beneficial.
â€œPeople want to know how our activities will affect them, and what we are doing to manage or avoid impacts in areas such as groundwater, transport and noise.
â€œIt's not always possible to have in-depth conversations at a work site, so we're trying to provide an environment where people can feel comfortable about talking with us.â€?
The new office will also act as a careers centre for local people and contractors interested in working for the company.
â€œAs we grow, there will be a substantial number of long-term career opportunities with QGC in Chinchilla.
â€œAs our operations expand, we will be looking to the community to get involved with our recruitment efforts.â€?
In addition, QGC has utilised the work of a number of local businesses to fit out the office space.
Mr Heidrich said he was confident QGC's operations would give the local economy and employment markets a significant boost.
â€œLocal people have often had to move to capital cities to take the next step in their careers, which makes if difficult for regional centres to sustain a high level of skilled worker.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"THE chief executive of the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in Western Australia says a $1.7 billion expansion was completed on budget, and the owners will consider further investment as new resources projects ``knock on the door''.
The 1600km pipeline, which connects the gas fields of WA's northwest with major industrial and residential customers, is one of the state's key pieces of infrastructure, especially with surging demand for gas during the resources boom.
 Dampier Bunbury Pipeline said yesterday it had raised $550 million in a local issuance of five-year bonds, in what is believed to be the biggest debt sale by a non-financial company in Australia in more than three years. It was the first BBB-minus issue in Australia this year.
The bonds are being used to replace some shorter-term debt used to finance the pipeline's expansion over the past five years, which has increased its capacity by about 60 per cent.
The $150m of fixed-rate notes and $400m of floating-rate bonds were priced at 300 basis points above swap rates.
DBP chief executive Stuart Johnston said the strength of demand for the bonds reflected the consortium's reputation and credit profile. He said pipeline capacity was contracted until 2019 and he did not expect another major capital investment to be required.
The most recent stage of the expansion, which involved installing a new pipe parallel to the existing asset, finished in April and cost about $700m.
Mr Johnston said the pipeline's owners, DUET Group, Alcoa and Prime Infrastructure Group, would only expand to meet real customer demand.
He said the likelihood of additional producers supplying domestic gas in the next several years -- including from the giant $43bn Gorgon project -- would not determine whether the pipeline needed to be expanded.
``If the capacity is required there's a lot more we can do.
``It could require expansion, but only when customers knock on the door -- not producers.''
Mr Johnston was recruited to run DBP after a 20-year career with Royal Dutch Shell.
He steered clear yesterday of entering the debate over whether WA is facing a shortage of fairly priced domestic gas.
Major energy users claim WA faces a shortfall of up to 600 terajoules a day between expected supply and demand in the next decade.

Coal seam gas generates lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal but some of the extraction methods, which involve using highly toxic chemicals to break up rocks, can contaminate water.
 What does Peabody have to hide?  said Jeff Angel, the executive director of the Total Environment Centre, which has been scrutinising the impact of mining on drinking water catchments.
 The company admits its longwall mining plan in the protected Sydney water catchment was controversial and then moved to disguise its involvement in gas drilling,  Mr Angel said.
 What makes it even worse is that the Department of Planning was complicit in agreeing to remove the gas drilling from the Metropolitan mine impact statement which protected the company from bad publicity. 
The Apex documents suggest the department was party to talks about Peabody's desire to distance itself from coal seam gas extraction, when the coal company was seeking approval for an $8 billion expansion for its Metropolitan Colliery. Apex temporarily withdrew its gas extraction proposals to give Peabody a clear run to get its coal mine approved.
 Discussions took place between Apex, Peabody and the Department of Planning in relation to the colliery's request and it was agreed to remove the sites from the Apex application,  the papers say.
 It was also agreed between all three parties that it would be a relatively simple process to add these sites to Apex's approved areas in the future, given that the three areas have been assessed in detail by Apex and had been part of its Part 3A submission. 
The Planning Minister, Tony Kelly, disputes this version of events.  At no stage did officers of the department take part in any three-way discussions with Apex and Peabody,  his spokesman said.  As far as the department is concerned, the decision to modify Apex's proposal was made by Apex itself and simply reported to the department.
 The department understands Apex had discussed the matter with Peabody prior to arriving at this decision.
 However, this was entirely irrelevant to the department's assessment of either proposal. 
Approval for Peabody's expansion of the Metropolitan Colliery was announced last year by the then minister, Kristina Keneally, with no mention of Apex's gas plans for the site.
Asked yesterday if coal seam gas extraction would go ahead at the site, a Peabody spokeswoman said  not today .
Apex said its August 6 discussion paper was out of date and the gas drilling sites at Metropolitan might no longer be viable, though others in the Illawarra had been approved and would go ahead.
Asked why it said Peabody was  sensitive  about its name being associated with coal seam gas drilling, an Apex spokesman said:  Logically it could be viewed that the business of any coal company could be sensitive to any activity by any party which may hinder their operations or make the operations more complex.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Financial Review Energy
The dynamics of the liquefied natural gas industry are set to change after finds in the Carnarvon Basin, writes Perry Williams.
 A spate of gas discoveries in Western Australia's Carnarvon Basin by rival operators Woodside Petroleum and US oil major Chevron are set to change the dynamics of the state's fast growing liquefied natural gas industry.
In the space of a week in mid-August, the two energy firms startled the market, reporting success from major exploration campaigns that appear to have eased the path for each company's proposed LNG developments.
Woodside is under pressure from investors to secure sufficient gas to allow a second LNG train, or processing line, to be sanctioned for its $13 billion Pluto LNG project while Chevron is competing with its own $25 billion Wheatstone development, not far from Pluto.
Both projects are crucial, not only for Western Australia, but also for the country as it looks to benefit from continuing strong interest in Asia for the clean burning fuel.
China's gas demand will rise from 9 billion cubic feet a day (93 billion cubic metres) in 2009 to 43 bcfd (444 billion cubic metres) in 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 7.5 per cent, with its strongest growth to come in the next decade.
Macquarie Bank says that although competition globally is intensifying in LNG markets, it remains bullish on the demand picture for the next decade.
 We are unambiguously bullish on medium-term LNG demand growth, forecasting demand to double from current levels to 372mtpa by 2020,  says Macquarie's Adrian Wood.  This implies annual demand growth of 6.6 per cent over the next 10 years, which is both higher than historical growth rates and almost three times the expected growth in overall gas demand during this period. 
Until now the mammoth $43 billion Gorgon LNG development has taken centre stage in the Australian LNG sector. The project, being promoted by partners Chevron, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, has sucked up workers and resources in the state.
But now attention is switching to the next wave of developments with Pluto, Wheatstone and the Ichthys project â€“ being developed by Japan's Inpex and France's Total â€“ taking pole position.
While Asian demand remains healthy, the immediate challenge for resource companies is to discover sufficient gas to feed the ambitious ventures.
Chevron continued an already impressive drilling campaign, describing one of its gas finds as one of the most significant in the country, adding to strong reserve numbers to fuel its huge Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied natural gas projects.
The oil major's Acme-1 well, located about 150 kilometres off the coast from Onslow, found a gas column on August 17 twice the size of the next biggest of Chevron's nine finds over the past year.
The Acme well followed the discovery of Brederode 1, located in the Exmouth Plateau, on August 13 which was the third gas find reported by the company off Western Australia since the start of July.
But Woodside also recorded its own impressive results, intersecting a 185m gas column at its potentially sizeable but remote Alaric prospect in the basin's far west along with a 50m column at its Larsen Deep well, about nine kilometres from its earlier Martell, Noblige and Larsen discoveries.
It was a welcome relief for Woodside after the three wells the company drilled in the June quarter â€“ Dalia South-1, Tiberius-1 and the previously announced Hine-1 â€“ were all dry.
Credit Suisse says Larsen Deep, combined with Woodside's other discoveries in the same permit, may hold between 2.5 trillion to 5 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas, giving sufficient reserves to underpin a new train.
Macquarie says the Alaric discovery, however, remains a more long-term deal.
 While Alaric looks like one of the smaller prospects on the block, Woodside is clearly excited and certainly it makes this area interesting,  it says.  We note the next wells on this block are not expected until mid-2011, confirming our suspicions that this is a longer term story. 
Although the exploration results have helped Woodside's cause, analysts tracking the stock remain cautious on the speed with which the company is moving on the exploration front with only 12 wells to be drilled in 2010 compared with the initial guidance of 17 wells.
 Despite February's commentary that Pluto 2 would not be delayed by a lack of gas, Woodside confirmed that Pluto 2 final investment decision has been pushed into 2011 as a result of slower progress on the exploration front,  Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood says.
UBS is more positive on its prospects, saying that despite the delay at Pluto 2, it estimates Woodside has found about 75 per cent of the gross gas volume required to support the expansion.
Deutsche is also reasonably bullish saying each of Woodside's next five wells to be drilled in its WA-404-P permit needs to find an incremental one trillion cubic feet of gas.
 Woodside will drill a further five wells in WA-404-P during the remainder of the year, and the likelihood of sufficient discoveries to underpin Pluto-2 is relatively high in our view based on the discovery rate to date,  Deutsche says in a client note issued on September 3.
Where the real intrigue lies is the next steps in the battle to bring fresh LNG supplies to market. Subsequent trains on LNG projects greatly enhance the economics of the project by leveraging off infrastructure and offering economies of scale.
Woodside, often cast as being in a desperate position, having to shore up gas from wherever it can get it, may now be in a much stronger position to move ahead.
The obvious focus for third-party gas supplies for Pluto-2 has centred on US explorer Hess which has been in talks about supplying gas from a number of gas discoveries held by the firm.
Hess is a 50 per cent partner in the Woodside-operated block WA-404-P but also owns 100 per cent of the exploration lease WA-390-P which has recorded an impressive string of discoveries.
Deutsche Bank says the Scarborough gas field, jointly owned by BHP Billiton and ExxonMobil, is now the only option for the supply of third-party gas for its Pluto project.  Based on Woodside's stated position of offering two LNG trains to a third party gas provider, we are further convinced that Scarborough is the only proven resource with sufficient gas to support two LNG trains,  Deutsche wrote in a recent client note.
But for Macquarie's Adrian Wood, Australian LNG plants targeting the Asian market are becoming a  crowded trade .
 There is simply not the market demand or construction capacity to see all projects succeed in any reasonable timeframe,  Wood says.
He warns that with around 40 per cent of the world's proposed LNG capacity in Australia, there are concerns about an over reliance on Australia's development capacity.
 There is a risk that Australia's reputation for reliability could come into question if development bottlenecks and industrial disputes slow progress,  he says.
Chevron is likely to be resting more easily, however, with more than 80 per cent of its gas offtake agreements for Wheatstone locked in with customers.
Korea Gas, the world's biggest LNG buyer, committed to the project in July while Japan's Kyushu Electric and gas suppliers Apache and Kuwait's Kufpec are also signed up.
Conversely, Woodside has yet to secure any customers for Pluto 2, adding to the pressure for the Perth-based firm to sanction the deal early in 2011.
Further gas finds for Woodside in the Carnarvon Basin will substantially advance its economic case for further Pluto expansions.
Shifting ground Woodside and Chevron startled the market in mid-August, announcing success from major exploration campaigns. These appear to have eased the path for each company's proposed LNG developments. Until now the mammoth Gorgon LNG development has been centre stage in the Australian LNG sector.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,3,"BHP Billiton has given the go-ahead for a $1.6 billion natural gas development off the north west coast of Western Australia.
The Macedon gas development will involve four offshore production wells supplying an onshore gas treatment plant near Onslow, just north of Exmouth.
 Another pipeline will connect the plant to the Dampier to Bunbury natural gas pipeline for sale to the West Australian gas market.
The project is a joint venture; 71 per cent owned by BHP and the rest belonging to Apache Northwest.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"LEIGHTON Holdings has won another contract from the monster $43 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas project on Western Australia's Barrow Island, this time for more than $800 million of civil and underground work.
This brings the total value of contracts announced by Leighton so far this financial year to $5bn.
 The contract includes earthworks, concrete and underground services, including drainage, piping and cabling at the LNG plant site.
Work will start immediately and is scheduled to be completed in mid-2013.
Leighton, as part of a consortium with Saipem, was last year awarded a $1.1bn contract for the design, supply and construction of the 2.1km jetty that will carry LNG from the plant to waiting export tankers.
Gorgon, the nation's biggest resources project, was approved late last year with Chevron as operator and is scheduled to produce its first LNG in 2014.
Ray Sputore, general manager of Leighton Contractors' western region, said Leighton would need to employ 1500 workers across both its Gorgon contracts.
Leighton shares rose 25c, or 0.8 per cent, yesterday to $33.20, beating the broader market's 0.2 per cent gain.
It is the second Leighton contract to be announced since David Stewart was named to succeed Wal King as chief executive on September 13. The other was a $180m Hong Kong highway project announced on Wednesday.
Managing director Craig Laslett said Leighton Contractors was proud to be given the chance to keep working on Gorgon.
``We have a genuine commitment to deliver the project with the highest standard of safety and to provide the expertise and services required to develop Australia's energy needs in line with sustainable economic development,'' Mr Laslett said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"BOARD members of one of the world's leading energy companies have flown in to Australia to look over their local assets and assess plans for one of Gladstone's most advanced multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas projects.
The visit marks the first board meeting in Brisbane of UK-based BG Group - owner of Queensland coal seam gas hopeful QGC. A BG spokesman insisted ``the visit has been planned for more than a year and is taking place coincidentally'' to plans for the proposed export LNG facility at Curtis Island in Gladstone harbour reaching a critical stage.
 He said the board made regular trips to better understand the company's assets.
Board members in Australia include chairman Sir Robert Wilson, the former Rio Tinto chief executive; John Hood, a former Oxford University vice-chancellor; and Baroness Sarah Hogg, a former BBC governor.
But BG said any big sign-off - a final investment decision - on the Queensland Curtis LNG project would only come after receiving federal government approval.
Hunter Green Institutional Broking's Charlie Green said if BG were to give the go-ahead, it would be a ``very significant'' event for the industry.
BG and Santos are regarded by analysts as the two most advanced of the four LNG projects planned for Gladstone. Both are waiting for new federal Environment Minister Tony Burke to give the green light for their ambitious plans.
In July, former environment minister Peter Garrett deferred decisions on the two projects until next month.
Origin Energy and Shell are also well advanced with plans to export coal seam gas as LNG from Gladstone.
Earlier this week Andrew Faulkner, the new CEO of Arrow Energy, which was recently taken over by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina, signalled that a final investment decision on its LNG project might not be reached until early in 2013.
Yesterday, Santos boss David Knox said his company was on track for first shipments from its Gladstone LNG project in 2014.
Mr Knox, speaking at a conference in Darwin, talked up the potential Asian demand for Australia's LNG.
He said Asian demand for natural gas would more than double in the next 15 years, which would offer significant opportunities for Australian exporters.
The biggest driver for demand would come from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, he said.

``Notwithstanding the growth of China and India . . . it is the emerging markets . . . that will be the biggest drivers in Asian gas consumption over the next 25 years,'' he said.
Mr Knox said every percentage increase of gas in Asia's fuel mix would equate to 62 million tonnes a year of LNG imports in 2035.
``That's four Gorgons in the West, or more than 15 trains (processing units) at Gladstone in the East,'' he said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,3,"EXCLUSIVE
THE company about to start coal seam gas drilling around southern Sydney and the Illawarra plans to use the controversial  fracking  technique to mine directly beside Warragamba Dam, which holds much of the city's drinking water.
 Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemicals deep underground to shatter rock strata and force coal seam gas to the surface, where it can be refined into natural gas for fuel.
The fracking process has raised serious environmental concerns centred on the impact of potentially toxic, rock-dissolving chemicals on underground water tables, and the disposal of big volumes of saline water pumped back to the surface.
The gas industry says the process is long established in Australia and completely safe.
Leaked confidential company documents written for a Sydney gas drilling company, Apex Energy NL, detail plans to extract coal seam gas from old coalmines along the edge of Lake Burragorang, the reservoir at Warragamba Dam.
Some gas can be extracted without fracking to stimulate the release of gas but  Apex expects that commercial levels of production will not be met without such seam stimulation,  the documents say.
Environment groups say fracking should be banned from around water sources.
 No one else would be allowed to enter the area with hundreds of chemicals and pump them into the ground. The catchment manager would throw the book at them,  said Jeff Angel, the executive director of the Total Environment Centre.
He is calling for a moratorium on new coal seam gas mining in NSW until a transparent, state-wide strategy is developed.
 The miners deserve no special privileges, especially since no mining operation is fail-safe ... Sydney's drinking water supply must have absolute protection. 
US studies have shown that chemicals used during fracking can contaminate groundwater, and the US Environmental Protection Agency is investigating links between drinking water impurities in heavily mined districts and health problems. A full report is to be produced in 2012.
The gas mining industry says there are no cases in the US of human health being affected by fracking.
Apex told the Herald its  preferred strategy is to avoid hydraulic fracturing for operational reasons and utilise alternative methods of exploiting the coal seam methane .
It has already received approval to drill 15 test wells along the Illawarra escarpment.
The company's description of hydraulic fracturing in its Illawarra document says the process  involves the injection of more than a million gallons of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure down and across into horizontally drilled wells as far as 10,000 feet below the surface .
But this week the company said:  Apex's strategy is to utilise the existing fracturing caused by strata relaxation resulting from coalmining operations rather than hydraulic fracturing. This will be beneficial to the environment. 
According to a timeline developed by the company, a part 3A planning application process for the Warragamba Dam drilling process will start at the end of March and be completed 33 weeks and four days later.
The drilling of gas production wells is to start in January 2012.
The NSW Planning Department said it was not aware of Apex Energy's intention to mine alongside Lake Burragorang, and it had granted approval for the Illawarra drilling sites on the basis that the drilling would take place only to test the viability of commercial-scale gas mining.
 Nonetheless, the department recognises the need to carefully consider all potential impacts that may arise from a particular project, including from the specific techniques to be employed,  a spokesman said.
 As such, the department rigorously assesses all applications it receives on a case-by-case basis on their merits. 
Fracking techniques are already being used at another coal seam gas operation, at Camden, south of Sydney.
It is run jointly by AGL and Sydney Gas, which holds many other petroleum exploration licences around the edges of the city.
During its most recent reporting period, 2008-09, the plant operated safely though a few minor spills of hydrocarbons were recorded.
 All spills and leaks were of minor, non-reportable quantity and cleaned up immediately to prevent off-site impact,  the project's annual environmental update said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"The Labor government's alliance with the Greens will soon be tested when Environment Minister Tony Burke makes a decision on $30Â billion of planned gas projects in Queensland that are opposed by Greens leader Bob Brown.
Mr Burke visited the proposed sites of the projects by BG Group and Santos around Chinchilla, Gladstone and Curtis Island on Wednesday and met public representatives concerned about the impact of expanded coal-seam gas extraction on underground water and farming. He said yesterday he intended to stick to the October 11 deadline of his predecessor Peter Garrett for a decision on environmental approvals.
  As soon as I'm in receipt of the advice from the department, I will be able to work through it to a decision. It's my intention to be able to do that soon,  Mr Burke said.  I'm pleased I will do that with a better understanding of community views and having seen the sites for myself. 
The projects involve the expansion of coal-seam gas extraction in the Surat Basin around Chinchilla and piping the gas to Gladstone and Curtis Island, where it will be converted to liquefied natural gas.
Senator Brown twice visited the region in the lead-up to the election and said the Greens wanted a moratorium on the expansion of coal-seam gas mining until there was better legal protection for productive farmland and water supplies. The Greens want the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act amended to enact their policies.
In the coal-seam gas extraction process, water is sucked out of the seams to the surface in order to release gas trapped within the coal. Farmers are concerned the process could interfere with water supplies in the Great Artesian Basin.
Mr Burke said he would consider community concerns when making his decision.  People are always concerned to make sure their water supply remains of good quality,  he said.  There are a number of issues people wanted to go through. Water quality was the key one. 
He also met representatives of BG's Queensland subsidiary about the company's proposed coal-seam gas-to-LNG development, which analysts speculate is worth between $10Â billion and $15Â billion.
The project would expand BG's coal-seam gas extraction in the Western Downs region from 600Â wells to 1800 by 2014. There would be a total of 6000 wells over 20Â years, though not all would be operational at once.
BG Group has said it expects to make a final decision this year, pending the federal government's ruling on environmental approvals, relating to the extraction and piping of the gas and the dredging of Gladstone Harbour. Santos plans to make a final decision by the end of the year on its $16Â billion project.
Queensland acting Premier Paul Lucas accompanied Mr Burke on a flyover of Gladstone and Curtis Island. Mr Lucas said he gave Mr Burke information about the importance of the projects and economic development in Queensland, and about the state government's strategic cropping land policy. The federal government is also considering the impact of the projects on the Great Barrier Reef.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Senior Santos and Royal Dutch Shell executives are optimistic new Environment Minister Tony Burke will clear a backlog of approvals pending on liquefied natural gas projects in Australia within weeks, helping avoid delays to some $46 billion of investment ventures.
The first decision, of Shell's $10 billion Prelude floating liquified natural gas project, is due October 1, making it the likely first major ruling since Mr Burke took over as minister from Peter Garrett. Similar rulings on Santos's GLNG and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG ventures, both in Queensland, are due by October 11.
  We hope, with the new minister in place, that we should get the environmental approval very shortly,  Bruce Steenson, Shell Australia's vice-president for Prelude, said yesterday at a conference in Darwin.
The ruling on the innovative Prelude project has already been deferred three times. The initial hold-ups were due to Shell's lack of specific commitments for dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, while the latest deferral was triggered by the government entering caretaker mode in the run-up to the election.
Any further delay would risk stalling a final investment decision, which Shell had been flagging for early next year.
The July deferral of a ruling on the two Queensland projects, each expected to cost about $18 billion, was more substantial, with Mr Garrett citing concerns about the long-term impact of coal seam gas extraction on groundÂ­water. The delay has already held up a final investment decision on BG's project which had been expected in the September quarter.
But Santos chief executive David Knox said yesterday he could see little reason for anything more than a minor extension of timing on the GLNG decision, adding there was a  reasonable chance  it would still be forthcoming in October.  We see no reason why we shouldn't be able to move forward in October because the bureaucracy has been doing an awful lot of work with us; they've not downed tools at all,  Mr Knox said in Darwin.
Stalled environmental clearances have been weighing on market sentiment about the ventures, with some commentators speculating a further delay that would derail Santos's already postponed final investment decision on GLNG. Santos and partners Petronas and Total SA are due to give the go-ahead for the venture by the end of the year.
Santos is also holding its breath for an approval from the South Korean government for a long-awaited LNG sales agreement with Korea Gas, likely to include the sale of a further stake in GLNG. Mr Knox said yesterday he couldn't estimate when that might be forthcoming but said it was not a prerequisite for the final investment decision.
Both Mr Knox and ConocoPhillips' manager of new venture opportunities Mark Nelson presented a bright outlook for LNG in Asia despite concerns raised by some industry analysts about risks to Australian LNG supply growth.
But Mr Nelson had no news to report on customer sales accords for its Australia-Pacific LNG venture with Origin Energy in Queensland, the only one of the four rival world-scale LNG projects in Gladstone that has yet to announce any offtake agreements. The absence of announcements on sales deals means that the go-ahead for that venture at least is likely to slip into 2011.
Separately, Woodside executive vice-president for project development, Feisal Ahmed, yesterday voiced confidence about the economics of the $30Â billion Browse LNG venture in Western Australia and that Woodside's partners in the venture would support the controversial project. The partners, BP, BHP Billiton, Chevron and Shell, not all of which supported the decision to base the project at a new site on the Kimberley coast, will formally review the work by the year-end, allowing the project to move into the front-end engineering and design phase next year.
KEY POINTS
-There is a backlog in approvals pending, with $46bn on the line.
-One project, Shell Australia's Prelude, has been delayed three times.
-Santos is also waiting for approval from the South Korean government.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"SANTOS'S attempts to bring Korea Gas in as a partner in the Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project could be derailed because of heavy scrutiny from South Korean officials.
It is understood South Korean government approval has taken longer than expected.
 Santos chief David Knox said yesterday at a Darwin conference that the long-awaited Kogas deal was waiting on government approval. He stressed there was no guarantee the deal would sail through the process and that the project was not relying on it to go ahead.
Because South Korea relies so heavily on imported energy, its government thoroughly investigates LNG import deals. Another factor is the government's controlling stake in Kogas.
Analysts have said the untested nature of the coal seam gas-to-LNG schemes planned for Gladstone meant South Korean and Japanese buyers were less likely to sign up. Kogas has reportedly said it wanted to have a deal complete by the end of the month.
There has been speculation Kogas will buy a 5 to 10 per cent stake in GLNG and agree to take 2 million tonnes a year of LNG.
Separately, Environment Minister Tony Burke confirmed he would stick to an October 11 date his predecessor Peter Garrett set for a decision on whether GLNG and BG Group's adjacent Curtis Island project would get environmental approval.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"AUSTRALIA'S resources boom continues to gather steam, with the nation's two biggest miners unveiling close to $2 billion in new investments yesterday.
While world titan BHP Billiton signed off on a $1.57 billion natural gas project off the northwest coast of Western Australia, iron ore heavyweight Rio Tinto said it would spend a further $240 million to beef up its operations in the Pilbara.
 BHP - Australia's biggest oil and gas producer - will develop the Macedon gas field with US energy partner Apache to meet growing demand in WA's tight gas market fuelled by the buoyant mining sector.
The Macedon field contains an estimated 400 billion to 750 billion cubic feet of gas, which is due to be piped to an onshore gas treatment plant from 2013.
The field was discovered in 1992 but only became commercially viable due to WA's gas shortage and high prices.
However, its close proximity to Ningaloo Reef and the Exmouth Gulf has raised environmental concerns.
The World Wildlife Fund and Wilderness Society of WA said Macedon was an example of the ``ad hoc'' approach to oil and gas development off WA's northwest coast, which could have a severe environmental impact.
``There are significant overarching problems for oil and gas exploration and production in Australia,'' WWF Australia WA director Paul Gamblin said. ``It is particularly concerning this project may be approved in close proximity to Ningaloo Reef, which is up for World Heritage listing.''
BHP said the project had undergone a ``comprehensive'' environmental assessment process that included community consultation.
BHP, which owns just over 71 per cent of the Macedon project, will spend about $1.1 billion on the venture, while Apache, which owns the rest, will tip in about $450 million.
Rio Tinto's new iron ore investment in the Pilbara is the fourth the company has announced since early July when it, BHP and Xstrata struck the amended mining tax deal with the Federal Government.
It brings the total investment in the ore-rich region to about $2.3 billion.
The latest funding will be used to boost capacity at its Dampier Port by an extra five million tonnes a year.
BHP shares lost 18c to $39.04.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,3,"The nation's food bowl will soon be only a memory, farmers warn. Debra Jopson reports.
FARMERS are warning that plans to drill for coal seam gas beneath the nation's prime food bowl will end agriculture as we know it.
 The drilling is part of the chase to find a  clean  alternative energy source to  dirty  coal.
Farmers say gas production companies use chemicals that can poison soil and water; their extraction techniques may destroy precious aquifers and the above-ground maze of infrastructure they build is an obstacle to farming.
 If you could imagine drill holes 600 metres apart, each with an all-weather access road over vast farming areas - that would be the end of farming as we know it,  said Robert Barry, a former Sydney merchant banker who has land holdings on the Liverpool Plains.
He and a neighbour, the retired Supreme Court judge Bob Hunter, are among a group of farmers preparing to lobby against Santos's plans for coal seam gas extraction on the plains. They are using YouTube, Facebook and score cards of how the political parties perform in halting the claimed threat to agriculture.  This is producing land. It's not just a pretty picture,  Mr Hunter said.
This week the Herald revealed plans for coal seam gas to be mined around Sydney, but one of the nation's largest gas producers is already drilling on pastoral properties in the Liverpool Plains in a quest for new energy sources encouraged by the NSW government.
West of Narrabri, Eastern Star Gas is also extracting gas in the Pilliga scrub in a pilot project. The company has won major project status from the state government for its planning application for a 272-kilometre pipeline from the Narrabri area to Wellington to carry the gas it hopes to produce.
For 18 months, Santos has explored the Gunnedah basin, where it has licences covering 22,000 square kilometres. After drilling about 25 core holes, it is moving to the next stage of establishing a pilot well site on private land after negotiations with the land-holder. The company argues that gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal and, when used to generate electricity, releases 60 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions and uses 99 per cent less water.
The government, which says the state lags its neighbours in gas exploration and exploitation, wants more production and provides gas companies with a five-year holiday from paying royalties.
Mr Barry and Mr Hunter, who live near Willow Tree, 75 kilometres south of Tamworth, have paid for a DVD to be released on the internet within a fortnight, aimed at forcing the main political parties to take action against plans to place gasfields on farms. Each has contributed $10,000 to produce theDVD, UtterMadness:Howthe government is prepared to destroy the most productive farming land in Australia.
â€˜â€˜It beggars belief the government would even consider allowing this unless it didnâ€™t knowwhat is going to happen with methane gas mining,â€™â€™ said MrBarry, whoholds land there with theDuke of Buccleuch fromScotland.
Meanwhile, about 150 farmers have formedthe MullaleyGas Pipeline Action Group to try either to stop the proposed pipeline toWellington or force it on to public land.
Judi Sheedy,whowith her husband, Paul, farms300 hectareswest ofGunnedah, said the pipeline would cause constant disruption to land-holders.
But drilling up to one kilometre into rich agricultural land would be worse, with serious concerns about crosscontamination among aquifers, threatening water used for stock and households.
MrHunter â€“who this month drove 900 kilometres to quiz Queensland farmers already living with coal seam gasfields â€“ said the infrastructure required would wreck the fragile Liverpool Plains. â€˜â€˜One of the things I have learnt is howsensitive this country is to natural interference and erosion,â€™â€™ he said.
Itsprincipal public affairs adviser in NSW, SamCrafter, said Santos designed its extraction processes to avoid any interaction with groundwater. It used chemicals thatwere mainly food-grade polymers, buried its pipelines and tookuplittle space in any paddock where it drilled.
â€˜â€˜There isnâ€™t any reason why coal seam gas and agriculture canâ€™t work together,â€™â€™ he said.

 This is where Narrabri's drinking water comes from. It's the southern recharge of the Great Artesian Basin and all this area is going to be gassed, so we are just going to screw our environment,  says Pickard.
 He has campaigned almost single-handedly against Eastern Star Gas operations in the Pilliga, claiming it threatens bushland, wildlife and the water supply and eventually, when they expand onto pastoral land, will put farmers' livelihoods at risk too.
He claims the chemicals poured down the drill holes could get into the aquifers, the predominantly methane gas that is extracted is a poison, and water brought up from the earth as a byproduct of drilling is saline and dangerous to plants and animals.
Here, as in the United States, coal seam gas drilling has polarised communities. Many farmers opposed to its extraction consider quitting when it comes their way; others take the average $5000 a well offered, reaping handsome returns if their properties are big enough.
Narrabri's mayor, Robyn Faber, is so confident about the safety of the Pilliga operation that she hopes treated water extracted with the gas will be pumped to Yarrie Lake outside town to become environmental flows that will help local waterways thrive.
 There is enough gas under Narrabri to cater to Australia's needs for 100 years,  she says as a mini resources boom hits the region.
This, she says, is not prime agricultural land. Applauding the company's plans to build a pipeline to Wellington, in the central west, which could eventually be used to deliver coal seam gas to coast-dwellers, she has a vision of a revitalised inland and a state saved from dirty coal-fired energy.
 I would like to see a series of gas-fired power stations down the Hunter Valley,  she says.
She wants to see her shire population swell from 13,500 - one person an hectare - so that the town could attract retail chains. She dreams of five flights a day to Narrabri where now there are two.
 I encourage governments to find mechanisms for encouraging people to move inland and not just up the coast,  she says.
The NSW government, desperate for a way to reduce carbon emissions, keep power flowing to the people and generate income for the state, is already heavily promoting coal seam gas development.
It is working on a gas industry development plan to promote it as a low-emission fuel and alternative to electricity, the Energy Minister, Paul Lynch, told a budget estimates committee this month.
 We have created a regulatory environment that encourages companies to explore the options of developing gas as an alternative fuel,  he said.
The strategy is working. Hundreds of drill holes have been dug around Sydney, in the Hunter, across the state's north and even off the coast as exploration continues apace.
People want an energy source they can consume with a clear conscience. But the dispute between Faber and Pickard in the north-west is a cameo for a broader conflict between landholders and environmentalists - who fear coal seam gas extraction - and those who believe it is clean, green, safe and lucrative.
In some locations overseas, the concerns are well-founded. This week, the US Environmental Protection Agency wrote to nine companies that use fracking techniques, including the resources giant Halliburton, asking for the lists of chemicals used to shatter rock during the process. Until now, the chemical recipes have been a closely guarded secret, but the companies have said they will comply.
Many are just beginning to wade through a thicket of potential lawsuits being brought by communities that have found high levels of toxins in their drinking water. In one case this month the township of Dimock in Pennsylvania found the toxic compound ethylbenzene in its water supply.
The agency is beginning a wider investigation, to be completed in 2012, into the use of fracking. The study will supersede one from 2004 which found no evidence of water contamination.
In NSW, there is no evidence that drinking water supplies have been contaminated by fracking. Once large-scale production begins across the state, the NSW Environment Department will assume oversight of any pollution incidents. At present, exploration licences for drilling test wells are overseen by the Department of Industry and Investment.
Environment groups, including the Total Environment Centre, want an informed public debate and a moratorium on new coal seam gas projects until the full effects can be known.
The potential risks came to light this week when it emerged that a Sydney company, Apex Energy NL, planned to extract coal seam gas from old coalmine workings next to Warragamba Dam reservoir, as well as other sites in the Sydney water catchment area.
Yesterday, Apex said the Herald's reports were inaccurate, contradicting briefing documents prepared by the company itself.
The company's corporate development manager, Chris Lawrence, told AAP it was aware of the risks posed by fracking.
 There have been problems elsewhere in the world [but] things come with risks,  he said.  Motor cars kill people but there are a lot of them on the road. 
Apex did not rule out its plans to mine next to the dam.  Never say never,  Lawrence said.
At Narrabri, the chief commercial officer of Eastern Star Gas, Roland Sleeman, rebutted all of Pickard's claims about contaminants threatening the environment and said NSW had for too long allowed its neighbours to produce gas which it imports even though the state is rich in the resource itself.
 This is a state crying out for indigenous gas production,  Sleeman said.
His company does not use fracking, the hydraulic fracturing technique decried by environmentalists, he said. Chemicals and water cannot escape from its drill shafts and the water released contains the byproduct sodium bicarbonate, a chemical so benign it is used in salt licks, swimming pools and hangover cures, Sleeman said. If his company's plans come to fruition, it will eventually be able to supply the state's coast and will spend $1 billion over 20 years in the Narrabri region alone, he said.
A Santos spokesman, Sam Crafter, said his company is aware of the sensitivities on the Liverpool Plains and is careful not to pollute the pristine pastoral environment.
Gas has a significantly lower carbon footprint than coal and is the ideal fuel to fire power stations as Australia awaits alternative energy sources capable of generating baseload power, he says.
But the chairwoman of the coal seam gas committee for the Caroona Coal Action Group, Rosemary Nankivell, says that Pickard's complaints about the company's Pilliga operations have provided Liverpool Plains farmers with an indication of what their future could hold.
 I believe it is going to lead to the destruction of agriculture as we know it on the Liverpool Plains,  she says.
The state laws which govern coal seam gas extraction do not protect the state's food sources, she says. Extraction has the potential to drain the aquifers, and in Queensland, where it is well-established, there have been too many accidents.
 It's often quoted as a transitional energy source. It's not. You are just replacing one fossil fuel with another fossil fuel,  Nankivell says.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Opposition resources spokesman Ian Macfarlane warned on Friday that the future of Queensland's $70Â billion liquefied natural gas export industry would be at risk if government and industry did not address concerns about water.
Queensland's coal-seam gas industry was  within a blink of getting absolutely stalled  a few months ago when landowner concerns escalated about the impact of the industry on their water supplies, he said in Darwin.
  Farmers are no longer confident their water supplies aren't being affected by coal-seam gas. 
Mr Macfarlane pointed to estimates that the volume of water to be pumped out of the coal seams each day by the industry was equivalent to Brisbane's entire water consumption.
Without the recent move by the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association to install Ross Dunn to negotiate with regional communities about the fast-developing industry, there would have been a  meltdown  in public support for the sector, Mr Macfarlane told reporters.
In July, then environment minister Peter Garrett delayed crucial environmental approvals of BG's and Santos's LNG projects in Queensland, requiring more answers about the impact of the industry on groundwater. New environment minister Tony Burke is due to rule on the approvals by October 11, although that date may be extended.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,3,"METGASCO SYDNEY, Sept 27 AAP - Gas companies LNG Ltd and Metgasco have agreed to jointly study the feasibility of project converting gas to liquefied natural gas (LNG) at Gladstone in Queensland.
The project also will look at the possibility of a new LNG facility in Brisbane, while Metgasco also looks at a separate LNG project, perhaps floating offshore.
 Both projects would use gas from Metgasco's Clance Moreton Basin in Northern NSW.
The joint study with LNG Ltd would look at feeding the gas to LNG's plant at Gladstone on the Central Queensland coast, with an option also of supplying the feed to  a potential LNG project to be sited within the Port of Brisbane .
In its own statement, Sydney-based Metgasco said it had begun feasibility studies into getting its gas to export markets.
 Metgasco intends to evaluate the commercial, environmental and technical feasibility of a number of export LNG options and form a view on whether an LNG export project is commercially feasible... , the company said on Monday.
 If this review determines that this commercialisation option has merit and is feasible, Metgasco expects to be able to select a preferred LNG project option in 2011. 
As well as the Gladstone option with its largest shareholder, LNG Ltd, Metgasco said it also had entered a memorandum of understanding with Norwegian-listed FLEX LNG Ltd to look at the feasibility of an LNG project floating offshore.
 Unlike other Australian coal seam gas projects, Metgasco's resources are located close to the coast, making floating LNG a commercial possibility,  Metgasco said in its statement.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"One of Australia's biggest liquefied natural gas customers has warned that new supply ventures will have to offer more flexible terms to win sales contracts as competition heats up between prospective projects in a limited growth market.
The ability to alter LNG purchase volumes in long-term contracts, to ship gas to various destinations and to take equity interest in gas reserves will all come into play, said Hitoshi Tagawa, managing director of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) in Australia.
 Australia has about $220Â billion of proposed LNG ventures, of which only a handful are expected to proceed on their current schedules, with others being delayed, amalgamated or dropped. ConocoPhillips, Inpex and Woodside Petroleum are among those seeking customers for planned projects in Australia.
Tepco, the biggest of Japan's 10Â main electric utilities and importer of 20Â million tonnes of LNG last year, buys LNG from both of Australia's producing projects, the North-West Shelf venture and ConocoPhillips's Darwin plant.
It is also due to take gas from ExxonÂ­Mobil's Papua New Guinea project and Chevron's  very promising  Wheatstone venture in Western Australia.
The PNG and Wheatstone deals will help replace long-term purchase contracts from Brunei, Malaysia and Abu Dhabi that are due to expire over the next eight years, Mr Tagawa said.
Tepco's hefty 4.1 million tonnes-a-year purchase deal with Wheatstone, the biggest single agreement ever signed in Australia, means the company is not in a hurry to sign up new contracts, although it remains interested on the right terms, Mr Tagawa indicated.
 Tepco is keen to look for new LNG projects if it fits our criteria, but obviously not in a hurry,  he told The Australian Financial Review on Friday.
He painted a bleak outlook for LNG demand growth in Japan, the world's biggest importer, as greenhouse gas emission reduction targets drive the power generation industry increasingly towards nuclear.
Depending on the severity of measures to address global warming, Japan's LNG imports could fall to as low as 50Â million tonnes a year by 2030, down from 62Â million in 2005, Mr Tagawa said.
Tepco itself has three new nuclear power units in the pipeline, with nuclear power expected to account for half of its electricity output by 2019, while LNG's share will fall to 28Â per cent, from 45Â per cent last year.
KEY POINTS Tepco buys part of its 20Â million tonnes a year of LNG from Australia. It says its LNG imports may dramatically decrease in the face of climate change measures.

NEW South Wales-based gas company Metgasco will assess an ambitious bid to partner with LNG Ltd and transport its coal seam gas more than 500 kilometres to Gladstone where LNG Ltd is planning to construct a liquefied natural gas plant for export.
 The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding and will jointly fund a feasibility study into the plan. Under the plan, gas from Metgasco's Clarence Moreton Basin in northern NSW would be piped to Fisherman's Landing in Gladstone. The possibility of developing the LNG plant in the Port of Brisbane is also being considered.
Metgasco says if the project is judged to be economic the company could select a preferred LNG option next year. One of those options is a floating LNG platform. Metgasco says it has also signed a separate memorandum of understanding with Norwegian-listed FLEX LNG to evaluate building the project offshore. Metgasco's 2239 petajoules of proved, probable and possible gas reserves are located on the coast, unlike many other coal seam gas projects, making the option a consideration. It says its resources could supply an LNG plant up to 3 million tonnes a year of gas over 20 years.
Metgasco managing director David Johnson said the company was well advanced in developing the Lions Way gas pipeline, which will transport gas from northern NSW to south-east Queensland.
 There are likely benefits in extending this pipeline to enable gas supply to the Port of Gladstone or the Port of Brisbane,  he said.
Maurice Brand, LNG Ltd managing director, said he did not believe the extra distance to transport the gas would be a problem.
 Our preliminary assessment shows that the extra gas pipeline distance from Metgasco's resource to Gladstone is not a critical factor in the overall project economics or project schedule,  he said.
Mr Brand said LNG's Fisherman's Landing site had enough area for four LNG processing trains delivering at least 6 million tonnes a year.  We are also working on additional gas supply to Fisherman's Landing,  he said. Metgasco shares jumped 5.5Â¢ to 50Â¢, while LNG Ltd's shares rose 0.5Â¢ to 45Â¢.

Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown has yet again voiced Council's concern over the proposal.
 â€œYes, we have been approached by QGC and we are aware of this, but no, we're not happy about it,â€? Cr Brown said yesterday.
â€œSimilar to our concerns over the Origin application, even if this does meet DERM's guidelines it is not beneficial use of the water.
â€œWe had concerns over QGC's proposed Wieambilla Creek option because it's not a continually flowing creek, it's spasmodic and it's not used to having water in it all the time.
â€œWe're looking for longer term solutions, there have been discussions that if the water can be put into the Chinchilla Weir upstream then it could be used for irrigators and town water supplies and to also keep recreational users like water skiers happy.â€?
But at the end of the day, like many environmentalists and landholders, Cr Brown admitted that council wants more answers.
â€œEven if this water can be used beneficially, it's not new water and it's been pulled out of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), so it needs to be put back there and until we can prove that this won't be detrimental to the GAB, then we don't want it.â€?

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"THE massive coal seam gas industry is knocking on the door of southeast Queensland with exploration now only 50km from Brisbane.
Plans are also being hatched for a billion-dollar processing plant in the Port of Brisbane.
 Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has started consulting locals around Boonah after recently buying out local company Arrow Energy which had discovered ``very encouraging'' gas flows from a nearby well site.
It also has exploration at Mt Lindesay while Lodestone Energy is exploring around Beaudesert for a potential site for underground coal gasification, a different process to coal seam gas.
Perth-based LNG Ltd and Metgasco Ltd said they were co-operating on a study to deliver gas from its tenements near Yamba and Grafton in northern NSW to the Asian market, and were considering an LNG plant at the Port of Brisbane or near Gladstone.
Brisbane would likely be much cheaper than Gladstone and Metgasco claims its floating processing plant would be environmentally benign and out of sight of coastal towns.
Coal seam gas is being produced by a host of companies who are rushing to meet demand for gas in Asia. This is causing anxiety in rural areas because of the impact on farmland, especially in the area around Dalby.
Giants such as Royal Dutch Shell and Santos are planning billion-dollar pipelines to Gladstone where the gas would be liquefied for transport by ship.
Two projects are awaiting final environmental approval from the Federal Government next month.
Glenda McLoughlin from Metgasco said the Port of Brisbane site was one option, but each idea would have to be tested for environmental, technical and financial viability.
She said the company had been working in northern NSW for a decade and had a good relationship with locals and did not expect any political or environmental backlash from the planned floating LNG unit off the coast.
A similar scheme is being considered in the Timor Sea and thought to be less disruptive than a land-based option.
But environmentalist Drew Hutton said the move closer to Brisbane by the industry would mean city residents would learn about the ``massive industrial transformation that's going on west of the Dividing Range''.
``It's turning peoples' lives upside-down,'' he said.
``It's clear the state and federal governments need to develop a strategic plan focusing on energy production and use in Queensland.''
The State Government was unaware of any talks about the Port of Brisbane project, and NSW councils were also unaware of any formal approach about infrastructure for a floating LNG facility.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Gas explorer Metgasco will weigh up two competing options to develop its NSW deposits for liquefied natural gas, comparing a revolutionary floating plant to a project to pipe gas up to Gladstone in Queensland for processing.
Metgasco yesterday announced two separate agreements with Queensland project developer LNG Ltd and floating LNG company Flex LNG to study the two alternatives in more detail ahead of a decision next year on which one to pursue.
 Whichever option is selected would be likely to involve entry into the project of a new partner to join Metgasco, while LNG customers could also participate.
The company's growing gas reserves in the Clarence-Moreton basin in northern NSW have already attracted attention from LNG buyers in Asia, who show no sign of being deterred by talk of a looming supply glut, chief financial officer Glenda McLoughlin said yesterday.  We have had a number of companies come to us prior to our commencing this LNG review,  Ms McLoughlin said.
Under Metgasco's accord with Oslo-based Flex, the two will assess whether they could locate a floating plant up to 20km off the coast of NSW to produce about 1.7 million tonnes per year of LNG.
No FLNG vessels are currently in operation, adding to the technical risks of that option, but Flex has four ships on order from Samsung Heavy Industries in South Korea.
The alternative involves transporting gas up to LNG Ltd's Fisherman's Landing site at Gladstone, which already has most of its approvals in place. The partners will also examine the possibility of building a new LNG plant in Brisbane.
Metgasco has already ruled out the option of LNG exports from Newcastle. Its project would be unusual in that it would likely use both conventional gas and coal seam gas, with production probably starting from conventional gas fields, helping reduce up-front capex commitments, Ms McLoughlin said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"New South Wales, where the coal seam gas (CSG) industry is in its infancy compared with Queensland, is increasingly showing signs it will follow in the footsteps of its northern neighbour and eventually host both export and local supply projects.
Dart Energy's expected friendly takeover of Apollo Gas to create a $560 million-plus company will consolidate exploration interests at the smaller end of the industry, typically a precursor to accelerated drilling and appraisal work.
 Such a deal would follow Drillsearch's $150 million merger with fellow Cooper Basin oil and gas play Innamincka Petroleum early this month, another example of a friendly combination of companies with similar assets and strategies.
While the terms of the deal were being kept under wraps yesterday, the less-developed industry in NSW means valuations of CSG assets in the region are typically below those in more-advanced Queensland.
The focus of much of Apollo's exploration work so far has been on a gas resource 15km from the established gas market of Newcastle. The existing Sydney-Newcastle gas pipeline and the planned Queensland Hunter Gas Pipeline ease access to potential customers such as power generators.
Meanwhile Metgasco's accords with LNG Ltd and floating LNG specialist Flex LNG to study two alternative export projects are being spurred by what the company says is keen interest from Asian LNG buyers keen to secure a foothold in NSW gas resources, despite forecasts of a possible supply glut.
Interest by foreign companies in NSW is mounting but has been slow compared to Queensland, where foreign majors sunk more than $20 billion of investment in 2008 and more than $70 billion of world-scale export LNG projects are under development.
The contrasting reserves tally is telling: NSW has 2466 petajoules of proven and probable CSG reserves, less than one-tenth of Queensland's, while its proven reserves total under 5 per cent of Queensland's, according to consultancy EnergyQuest. Yet the pace of developments has picked up. Santos and AGL Energy are building up reserves in the Gunnedah and Gloucester basins, while Eastern Star Gas was joined by Hitachi and Toyo Engineering for a planned LNG project at Newcastle port using coal seam gas from its Narrabri project.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"Consolidation in Australia's red-hot coal seam gas sector is moving south to NSW, with Arrow Energy offshoot Dart Energy expected to announce today a friendly scrip-based merger with smaller partner Apollo Gas.
The takeover would create a company valued at over $560 million with a key acreage position in the fast-emerging coal seam gas province near Newcastle, where junior companies are jostling for acreage positions in the hope to replicate the success that Arrow and Queensland Gas had in Queensland.
 Analysts suggested that Dart, which already owns 21 per cent of Apollo, may agree to pay a 20-40 per cent premium for the rest of the shares, indicating a possible offer of around 73Â¢-85Â¢ per share. That would value Dart at as much as $170 million. Apollo shares last closed at 61Â¢.
Dart picked up its stake in Apollo among the rump assets spun off from Arrow in July before its $3.4 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina. The two companies are partners in two key exploration permits, while Apollo non-executive director Stephen Bizzell is also a director of Dart.
Both Dart and Apollo yesterday halted shares from trading. Dart said this was pending the announcement of a  material acquisition . Apollo, advised by Wilson HTM, cited negotiations on a potential change-of-control transaction.
While the companies declined to comment on their plans, analysts agreed yesterday that a friendly merger was the most likely outcome.
 This does seem to be a logical acquisition for Dart: most of their acreage is overseas, but this would give them a material presence in Australia as well,  said Nik Burns at RBS Morgans.
Dart, whose Asian operations span China, Vietnam, India and Indonesia, last month highlighted its expansion ambitions in Australia, citing its strategy as  grow fast, grow big . It also wants to expand into new coal seam gas regions in Asia, and has embarked on an expansion into Europe through a 10 per cent stake picked up in privately owned Composite Energy.
An agreed stock-based deal would  make sense  as Dart had exploration commitments which were already expected to require a capital raising within the next 12 months, Mr Burns said.
Apollo holds interests in seven exploration licences covering about 23,600 square kilometres of the Sydney-Gunnedah basin.
In addition to the Apollo holding, Dart's Australian assets include stakes in Bow Energy and Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd.
In July Dart committed to a second phase of exploration work in Apollo's PEL458 permit near Newcastle, involving an investment of $7 million. Taking over Apollo would circumvent that payment, while Dart would also then benefit from Apollo's about $12 million of cash on hand.
 Arrow was certainly excited about some of the early drilling results coming through in Apollo's acreage in NSW,  Mr Burns said.

There are suggestions changes to the alternative fuels industry will be considered as part of a larger blueprint for the energy sector.

An industry source said Treasury was close to finalising the details of a discussion paper which would help determine whether alternative fuel producers, distributors, retailers or consumers would pay the excise.
An Energy white paper, initiated by former prime minister Kevin Rudd, is unfinished business for the new minority government.
The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism began its consultations for the policy paper in September, 2008.

BSA members met with the Federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities Tony Burke last week where they asked that all CSG be stopped until the full impacts of the industry have been investigated.
 Basin Sustainability Alliance vice chairman Andrew Rushford said the group was concerned that the CSG industry may irreversibly damage the GAB.
â€œOften many of these areas have no access to alternative water sources,â€? he said.
â€œGroundwater systems do not recognise state borders; impact in one state could have nationwide implications.â€?

â€œHe showed particular interest in the case studies of existing groundwater impacts which we presented,â€? he said.
â€œThese incidents of water drawdown and adverse changes in water quality are currently under investigation. It is concerning that these impacts are occurring in CSG areas so early in the development of this industry.â€?

â€œWhat we need to know is if there is an impact,â€? he said
â€œIf there is, fine acknowledge it and we can judge the risk and ask the community.â€?
Mr Rushford said while the BSA were not against the CSG industry they believed a moratorium must be placed on the industry until the potential impacts on other industries and the community were better known.
Mr Burke has until Monday, October 11 to decide upon the fate of almost $200 billion worth of projects from Santos and QGC.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,3,"WHILE the big picture outlook for Australia's resource revenues remains happily buoyant, the coming months may not be the time to lay a bet on short-term price rises.
Not only is China trying to rein in steel production and oil-linked liquefied natural gas prices forecast to drop, but a surging Australian dollar will make falls in prices for our most valuable commodity exports steeper in local currency.
 Prices of the steelmaking commodities, iron ore and coking coal, (the nation's two biggest exports) are expected to ease in the fourth quarter.
This will slow the mountains of cash heading into the coffers of our largest miners, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and set the stage for an easing of the nation's historically high terms of trade.
The country's third-biggest resource player, Newcrest Mining, should fare well though, with the prices of gold, the nation's third-biggest export, and copper forecast to increase.
ANZ head of commodity research Mark Pervan last week downgraded his 2011 forecasts for coking coal and iron ore because of cooling Chinese and developed-world demand growth.
Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Young is predicting a 15 per cent drop in iron ore prices in the fourth quarter -- to $US127 a tonne -- and an 8 per cent drop in hard coking coal prices to $US225 a tonne.
``We expect flat Chinese steel demand to result in lower iron ore prices in the fourth quarter and heading into 2011,'' Mr Young said.
ANZ expects iron ore prices to average $US151 a tonne next year, down 4 per cent from the previous forecast, and coking coal to average $US229 a tonne, down 15 per cent from last year.
Things are not expected to stay down for long, though.
Mr Pervan said 2012 was looking more favourable for both iron ore and coking coal, partly as increased domestic Indian steel output cuts its iron ore exports, which mostly go to China, and increases its coking coal imports.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,3,"SENIOR Coalition frontbencher Ian Macfarlane has told one of the world's biggest resource companies that the coal seam gas industry was finished in Queensland if it did not resolve its issues over water.
While Tara's blockies were claiming they had scared off drilling in their area, west of Brisbane, through their blockades and protests, environmentalists also warned businesses last night that they could be affected by a campaign of non-violent civil disobedience to stop work in the Surat Basin gas fields.
 But to counter the campaign, BG-owned Queensland Gas revealed it had budgeted to spend about $1 billion on treating the ground water from deep aquifers and returning it to the system for use by farmers and towns.
Mr Macfarlane said he had warned the industry that it had to get it right.
``I don't think there's any middle ground on it,'' he said.
``I've been telling them for 18 months they needed to get this sorted.
``On the day Kevin Rudd was deposed, (BG chief executive) Frank Chapman was in my office and I told him that if you don't get this right, you are finished.''
Mr Macfarlane said no one knew the magnitude of what was going on in the Surat Basin, although the State Government had reached a turning point at its community Cabinet in Roma recently.
``No one really had an idea of how big this was, or how much this industry was going to intrude on the people already there,'' he said. ``I guess the industry has really only, in the last three months, started to address the key issues.
``It's a case of being sure of your facts and going out and engaging the farmers, not lecturing to them.''
Farming groups have rallied together with environmentalists to oppose the coal seam gas industry, which intends to drill about 40,000 wells in central and southern Queensland and pipe gas to Gladstone for processing and export.
Tara resident Michael Bretherwick said it had been weeks since BG's subsidiary QGC had been in the area and it was likely the residents' blockade had scared off the contractors.
``We still sleep with one eye open,'' he said.
Environmentalist Drew Hutton was due to tell a business gathering last night that Friends of the Earth would be co-ordinating a sustained campaign of blockades and disruption.
But QGC said it had not stopped work in the Tara estates.
``We have not had works scheduled around Tara, but the area is an important part of our existing and ongoing operations,'' a spokesman said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,3,"French oil major Total has signalled it has both the appetite and the financial strength to pursue more acquisitions in the Australian liquefied natural gas sector should it find the right opportunity.
The Paris-based company, which this month paid $860 million for 20 per cent of Santos's LNG project in Gladstone (GLNG), and owns 24 per cent of the $23 billion Ichthys venture, could accommodate a third Australian LNG project within its portfolio, senior vice-president, Asia Pacific, exploration and production, Jean-Marie Guillermou, said yesterday in Perth.
  There will be room to develop a third one if there is a third one to develop,  he said.  Our chairman used to say: 'Find me a good project and I will find you financing facilities, don't worry.'â€Š 
He was confident of Total's ability to find customers for its Australian LNG, revealing discussions are under way with Chinese and Taiwanese customers.
 The market [for gas] is still bullish, especially in Asia,  Mr Guillermou said.  I think Gladstone LNG is a very good example of the fact that you can still sell gas in this market at an attractive price. 
The GLNG venture so far has agreements to sell LNG to Petronas and Total, but both companies are expected to sell fuel on to end users.
The Darwin-based Ichthys project, led by Japan's Inpex, has yet to ink any customer accords.  I'm sure we will find an agreement with the buyers,  Mr Guillermou said.  It is a matter of negotiation, of course, and price especially, but so far Asia is clearly pulling the market [higher] compared to other places in the world. 
The French oil chief said Total's stake in the Ichthys project could falldepending on whether it sold an equity stake to its Asian customers. On the other hand, Inpex may want to farm out more of the project to Total, giving it a bigger holding.
 We are happy with Ichthys, so far we have 24 per cent in the project,  he said.  There's a possibility this might increase a little bit. 
Total has seconded Antoine Serceau, its senior vice-president of projects, to take up a role as project director at Ichthys to develop the venture.  Inpex is not a very experienced operator . . . we are there to support them; we want to be recognised as one of the main actors in the Australian oil and gas industry,  Mr Guillermou said.
Total also plans to begin drilling two wells by mid-December in the Bonaparte Basin off the north coast of Western Australia. The $120 million cost of the drilling will be shared with 40 per cent partner, Malaysia's Petronas.
On the local debate over a carbon price, Mr Guillermou said all efforts to reduce emissions should be considered, such as sequestering carbon dioxide, a method to be tested at Ichthys.
But measures to tackle carbon pollution must  not jeopardise the competitiveness of Australian oil and gas developments , he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"This is one fossil fuel the party may learn to live with, if not love
THE Greens don't like fossil fuels, but their support for reducing carbon emissions could further increase the demand for Australia's natural gas.
 Along with an increasing focus on euthanasia and same-sex marriage, and other policies highlighted by the Greens since the election, the challenge of addressing climate change and introducing a price on carbon is now also on the new government's agenda.
Both major parties promised during the election campaign that Australia would not face a price on carbon. Now that the Greens' influence has markedly increased, that commitment has already been overturned.
This is a good outcome for several reasons. Industry needs certainty in order to invest and, with doubt surrounding the government's recent approach to pricing carbon emissions, investment in power generation has slowed.
Also, with the rest of the world addressing climate change -- admittedly to varying extents -- Australia would be left behind in its development of new technologies if we ignored this new international direction.
And, whether you believe the expected rapid change in the climate is caused by human activity or not, there is clear benefit in reducing, or beginning to reduce, pollution of the atmosphere.
That's where the Greens come in -- and their determination to introduce a price on carbon could assist one of those fossil fuels they love to hate, natural gas.
The doomed emissions trading scheme -- the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme -- was a mighty attempt to introduce a complex, expensive market mechanism of both pricing and limiting carbon emissions.
While encouraging pollution reduction on the one hand, it provided compensation to polluters to the extent that, in its initial phase, it was highly unlikely to reduce emissions at all. Also, the ability to import carbon credits undermined its potential to reduce Australia's emissions.
On the other hand, a pure carbon price -- one that provides a blunt market instrument to increase the cost of pollution without extravagant compensation to polluters -- is more likely to lead to a fall in Australia's carbon emissions because it would provide incentives for power generators to switch from coal to gas.
Australia's coal industry is important to the national economy and should not be gutted but, let's face it, times and attitudes are changing and our economy must adjust.
The coal industry must also adjust, and acknowledge that natural gas will be the next major fuel of choice for this nation.
Energy supplied by natural gas has less than half the emissions of energy provided by coal-fired power generation. Gas is the fuel of the future, replacing coal for reliable, relatively low-cost base-load generation and as a rapid response complement for renewable energy generation.
Renewable power is intermittent and gas-fired power can be called up on demand, both to cover the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy, as well as covering peak demand times -- as it does now.
Of course, Australia must encourage the development of renewable power generation, but it also must avoid discouraging further development of Australia's natural gas industry, both the gas reserves and the transportation infrastructure. If the $10 billion currently committed by the federal government to renewable technology and carbon capture and storage development was committed to building new gas-fired power generation, Australia would immediately reduce carbon emissions by at least 8 per cent. Clearly, in its entirety, this is not feasible, but it's an indication of the benefits of gas and the benefits to Australia of increasing the use of natural gas, supplies of which Australia has in abundance. This time the Greens will be supporting use of a fossil fuel and this will be to the nation's benefit.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND's fledgling coal seam gas export industry and the big North West Shelf liquefied gas project will not be taxed on LNG production under tax agreements struck with the Gillard government in the wake of Kevin Rudd's failed resource rent tax.
Instead they will be taxed on gas production at a point just before the methane enters the big multi-billion freezers that liquefy the gas and ready it for export by ship to Asia.
 The nation's onshore petroleum ventures and the North West Shelf, which is not part of the existing offshore Petroleum Resource Rent Tax regime, will be moved under the PRRT as part of Julia Gillard's mineral resources rent tax compromise. The taxing point was confirmed in a 130-page issues paper that was released yesterday by the MRRT Policy Transition Group.
The group is co-chaired by federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and former BHP Billiton chairman Don Argus.
The move brings the coal seam gas projects in line with proposed and existing offshore LNG projects, where the PRRT also kicks in before the expensive processing. It will mean the CSG projects are more likely to pass the internal rate of return hurdles set by their developers.
``The PRRT approach to defining the taxing point appears to be broad enough to accommodate the different types of project, onshore and offshore, conventional and unconventional, as they will all produce one form of MPC (marketable petroleum commodity) or another,'' the transition group said in its issues paper.
The sweet taxing point partly explains why the CSG proponents -- Santos, Origin, BG Group and Shell -- have been silent on the tax regime since striking deals with Ms Gillard, as has Woodside.
Last night, the Australian Petroleum Producers and Explorers Association would not comment on the issues paper. Nor would the coal seam gas proponents.
A Woodside spokesman couldn't be contacted.
One of the biggest issues now for the tax will be how the value of the huge North West Shelf project is calculated.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte negotiated the ability to depreciate the value of the project, which cost about $50 billion to build, using inflation-adjusted figures, in five stages. Woodside operates the North West Shelf and owns one-sixth of it. The other five owners are BHP Billiton, Chevron, Shell, BP and Japan Australia LNG.
One of the biggest determinants of how much the government makes from the new tax will be the market value assigned to the North West Shelf for depreciation purposes. Woodside says it does not expect the tax regime to collect more from it than the current royalties and excise regime under which it operates.
The North West Shelf was exempt from the PRRT because it was approved before the tax was put in place.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE Gladstone region is preparing for a huge influx of residents in the years ahead as billions of dollars of infrastructure starts to take shape.
Gladstone has long been a coal mining town, but the arrival of liquefied natural gas (LNG) looks set to launch this Central Queensland region into another stratosphere entirely.
 According to the Queensland Government, the LNG industry is worth $40 billion to Queensland and has the potential to create 18,000 jobs.
To prepare for the expected increase in workers and residents, Gladstone Airport now has the capability to take jet aircraft following the commissioning of an extended and reconstructed runway just 15 months after works began.
The runway has been extended from 1635 to 1965 metres. Aviation protocols require full passenger and baggage screening in place for jet aircraft operations, which should be in place at the airport by the end of the year.
Over the June quarter, REIQ figures found the Gladstone region holding its own despite a number of negative influences.
Agents reported steady activity even though economic uncertainty and the proposed mining tax were unsettling buyers during that period. Indeed, the region was one of the few areas to post an increase in the number of preliminary house sales over the June quarter.
One buyer-type not afraid to purchase property were investors who continued to show strong interest in the region, specifically those from other areas impacted by mining and LNG.
Agents are expecting buyer inquiry to steadily increase in the months leading up to Christmas with demand next year likely to be stronger still.
REIQ Gladstone zone chair Mark Spearing said the June quarter had been mixed partly due to uncertainty surrounding the proposed resources tax during that period.
``There was some uncertainty there, but then again, the market was generally steady throughout the period. We haven't seen a rush or glut of properties. Indeed, available stock has probably reduced in number at present,'' Mr Spearing said. ``Gladstone's market held its own, and continues to do so, given the opportunities that lay ahead for the region. There remains robust confidence about the future of Gladstone as the development of LNG continues to take shape.''
According to Mr Spearing, optimism about the region's future has resulted in builders buying large tracts of available land to develop as Gladstone's population grows and demand increases in the months and years ahead.
Agents also reported steady rents over the June quarter with demand remaining strong from the ever-increasing number of workers relocating to the region. Vacancy rates are constrained however the robust number of active investors will continue to add to the pool of stock.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"FEDERAL Environment Minister Tony Burke has delayed by 12 days his timetable for approving Santos and BG Group's proposed liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland.
Rulings on the LNG ventures, which will tap Queensland's vast coal seam gas reserves, are now expected by October 22.
 Mr Burke's predecessor, Peter Garrett, had in July deferred a decision on the projects until October 11.
While the Queensland Government has already cleared the Santos and BG plans, state Co-ordinator-General Colin Jensen has raised concerns that the ``significant'' amount of water and salt extracted in the coal seam gas process could pose environmental risks.
Yesterday Mr Burke also deferred until November 12 a decision on Shell's proposed Prelude LNG project off Western Australia, for the fourth time.
``We appreciate that given a new Environment Minister has only recently been appointed that he will need some time to consider our project before making a decision,'' Shell said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Royal Dutch Shell has suffered another delay in securing environmental approval for its revolutionary Prelude floating liquefied natural gas project off the far north-west coast after new Environment Minister Tony Burke deferred a ruling on whether to give it the all-clear.
The deferral, the fourth for the project, casts some doubt over whether Mr Burke will also keep to the October 11 target for decisions on environmental approvals of two coal seam gas-based LNG projects in Queensland, though he indicated last week the date still stood.
 The two Queensland projects, led by BG and Santos, represent a combined investment of more than $30 billion.
Shell said on Friday it appreciated  that given a new Environment Minister has only recently been appointed that he will need some time to consider our project before making a decision .
The Prelude project is still on schedule to reach a final investment decision in early 2011, a spokeswoman said.
The minister's decision is now due on November 12.
Prelude, estimated by analysts to cost between $6 billion and $10 billion, may be the world's first floating LNG venture and is one of several being considered for the north-west coast of Australia, including Woodside's Sunrise venture and the Bonaparte LNG venture between GDF Suez and Santos.
The ruling on the innovative Prelude project had already been deferred three times, initially because of Shell's lack of specific commitments for dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, and later when the federal government entered caretaker mode in the run-up to the election.
Shell started detailed engineering and design studies last year for the development of its Prelude and Concerto fields in the Browse Basin.
Gas will be extracted to the surface and processed through LNG facilities aboard what Shell said would be the largest vessel ever built.
Shell refused to commit to using geosequestration to dispose of carbon waste emitted during the production process and wants instead to flare waste gas and rely on buying permits under a carbon trading scheme to offset emissions.
The project will emit almost 2.3 million tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to more than half a million average cars.
The delay in the Queensland rulings has already held up BG's final investment decision for its Queensland Curtis project, while Santos also needs clearance to give the go-ahead for its GLNG venture by the year end as currently scheduled.

Minister. Mr Wilson said Mr Burke's previous role as agriculture minister could mean he was more sympathetic to Queensland farmers' concerns about the potential effects of CSG extraction on the water table.
A spokesman for BG said the company would not make a decision on whether to proceed until it had been able to assess any environmental restrictions placed on the development.
``We have consistently said that we will make a final investment decision on the project after we have received acceptable environmental conditions,'' the spokesman said.
Mr Wilson in his report warned: ``If the federal approval process slips beyond October, then Santos's target of a GLNG Train 1 final investment decision by the end of 2010 will be very challenging.''
A Santos spokesman said the company was confident of getting a ministerial decision by the end of October so it could finalise investment plans by the end of the year.
The two projects, each worth about $10bn, plan to produce CSG from thousands of small onshore wells in Queensland.
The gas will be piped to Gladstone's Curtis Island, where it will be frozen for export.
Treasurer Wayne Swan has previously said the federal and Queensland governments were working on the approval process with the developers.
``We are acutely aware of just how important this industry is for jobs, growth and the community, and recognise the need to get this resolved quickly,'' he said when the decision was delayed for the first time.
``These are large and complex projects and, whether we like it or not, we need to operate within the confines of the rules.''

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"MINING By Petrina Berry
BRISBANE, Oct 5 AAP - Proposed new laws to ban toxic chemicals from use in coal seam gas (CSG) operations were introduced to Queensland parliament on Tuesday.
 Natural Resources Minister Stephen Robertson introduced the bill, which bans the CSG industry from using BTEX in fraccing - a process where fluid is pumped at high pressure into a coal seam to fracture the seam and allow gas to flow readily into gas wells.
BTEX is an acronym for the toxic group of petroleum chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes.
The proposed new laws come after Cougar Energy's pilot underground coal gasification plant near Kingaroy was shut down in July after traces of benzene and toluene were found in nearby bores.
However, a spokesman for Mr Robertson told AAP the Cougar Energy water contamination scare did not trigger the bill.
He said Mr Robertson was fulfilling a promise he made in August to ban BTEX.
 Although I acknowledge that industry has assured me these chemicals are not currently used this amendment ensures protection of the community and the environment by legislating to ban BTEX from ever being used in Queensland,  Mr Robertson told parliament.

MELBOURNE, Oct 5 AAP - Linc Energy Ltd has signed a memorandum of understanding with German research centre GFZ to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for the company's underground coal gasification (UCG) operations.
Linc said on Tuesday that GFZ would work on UCG and CCS exclusively for Linc Energy over the next three years.
GFZ would also conduct research to confirm the extent of CO2 (carbon dioxide) storage available in UCG cavities.
Linc will contribute 24,000 euros ($A33,922) per quarter towards the UCG-CCS research and retain ownership of all intellectual property developed.
 This agreement indicates just how committed Linc Energy is to utilising stranded coal for the cleanest possible energy products, such as power and fuels, and demonstrates our intentions to create a carbon neutral commercial operating environment,  Linc Energy chief executive Peter Bond said.
 It is well known that UCG cavities provide one of the best opportunities to store CO2 on a commercial scale.
 Work resulting from our agreement with GFZ will confirm the exact quantity of CO2 to be stored, including modelling the process and its applications. 
Linc said studies indicated that UCG cavities could absorb significant quantities of CO2 and up to 400 times more carbon than traditional CCS methods.

The equity raising consists of a placement of up to 253.4 million shares at $0.30 a share to raise about $76 million.
Also, there will be a one for two non-renounceable rights issue at $0.30 a share to raise about $34 million.

 The Bathurst and L&M teams have done a great job in developing the Buller Project to its current state,  Bathurst managing director Hamish Bohannan said in a statement.
 The next step is for Bathurst to seek shareholder approval to acquire the project from L&M Coal Holdings Limited at a General Meeting to be convened in the coming days. 
 With the funds raised from the rights issue and the placement, Bathurst is on track to both complete the acquisition of the project and become a coking coal producer in the last quarter of 2011.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WE do well to remain alert but not overly alarmed by Tony Burke's decision to spend an extra 11 days considering the commonwealth environmental approvals that remain the final bureaucratic hurdle for $20 billion worth of investment in Queensland's coal-seam methane future.
Certainly, the new Environment Minister has failed to deliver on a commitment to meet the October 11 deadline set by his predecessor Peter Garrett for a decision on a pair of Gladstone liquefied natural gas projects.
 What's more, the decision to take further ministerial thinking time will doubtless feed industry's simmering uncertainty about the influence of Greens and pastoralists on the future shape of government policy.
Nonetheless, the lead proponents of the two Curtis Island projects currently awaiting final environmental approval, Santos and BG, seem genuinely sanguine about Burke's extension.
As does, for that matter, Shell Development, whose $2bn Prelude LNG project was last week handed an even longer delay by Minister Burke. Final decision on Prelude, which will be a world's first in floating LNG technologies, was due last Friday. It is now slated for November 12.
The companies' maintain a restrained but consistent confidence in the outcomes being brewed by Burke and his new department -- built on a collective belief that the time-outs are more the product of politics than policy. Even by international standards, each of these projects is ground-breaking either in the feedstock being used to feed and LNG plant (coal seam methane) or in the technology being proposed (the floating LNG plant that Shell wants to use to tap its gas in offshore waters in WA's northwest).
The complications are real and, if anything, the applicants thought Burke was being a little ambitious when he arrived at his new office announcing a determination to meet the existing deadlines.
The coal seamers believe they have done all they can to assuage the concerns of Burke's predecessor over water management in particular and they firmly expect approval to be granted, although they remain alert to the prospect of material conditions being attached to that clearance.
That Burke appears to have
Continued on Page 24
Continued from Page 19
accounted for the individual commercial necessities of each of the proponents in seeking more time serves to reinforce that confidence. Given Burke now sticks to the dates confirmed last week, his extensions will have made no material difference to any of the three LNG projects sitting in his in-tray.
As things stand, for example, Santos is probably the most time-pressed of the applicants given its publicly stated preference for a positive decision by the end of October so it can move to a final investment decision before the end of the year.
It would be a fair bet too that the still formulating ownership structure of Santos's project will not be finalised until this last regulatory hurdle is cleared. The market is keen for Santos to get an end-user of its gas directly involved in its project (so far its partners are Malaysia's Petronas and Total of France, both of which are marketers of gas rather than end-users). And for the best part of a year now, Korea's KOGAS has been talking up the idea that it will be both customer and investor in Santos's chunk of Curtis Island LNG and the gas that feeds it.
Back in September when Total bought 20 per cent of the project (15 per cent from Santos and 5 per cent from foundation partner Petronas), we suggested that the Spring racing carnival was a likely timeframe for the sealing of the KOGAS deal. All things being equal, that timeframe stands.
As we have suggested in the past, the outcomes here for the Santos and BG projects loom as something of a litmus test for the government if only because there are no pre-existing agreements that define or constrain the political response to the issues triggered by the construction of the CSM-fuelled LNG industry in Queensland.
Ahead of the election, Garrett pushed the pause button on CSM, citing the impact of drilling on the aquifers that feed the Great Artesian Basin as a core reason for delay.
But that was plain theatre. The issues of water management for the proposed developments are very real and that is why they have been addressed so extensively in both sets of submissions to the state and federal governments.
As we have previously suggested, Garrett's original decision to extend was quite reasonably received as an understandable product of pre-election politics.
The election outcome though exposed the risk of Garrett's delay. It introduced Queensland's coal-seam boom babies to a new and worrisome level of political uncertainty.
Already future Greens senators of Queensland and NSW have called for a moratorium on the CSM development while pastoralists in both states have expressed loudly, and to considerable effect, their concerns that their interests will be subsumed by those of the gas companies. These are issues that have been embraced with varying degrees of aggression by each of the three rural independents that eventually decided the election in Julia Gillard's favour.
As we have previously identified, the Prime Minister is not now as free to ignore the ideologically rigid or the fearful who would stall Queensland's newest energy province.
Her mandate is a product of the Greens and independents. And that is why the Curtis Island decisions will be a test of the government's ability to pursue outcomes that deliver lasting and substantial economic benefit to the nation in the face of any objection from its new partners.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"RESOURCES
ORIGIN Energy and Woodside Petroleum are unlikely to deliver their liquefied natural gas projects on time, according to an industry report card.
 A slump in LNG prices and signs of potential oversupply have thrown the future of some Australian projects into doubt.
In a report on the Australian LNG sector, Citi, led by analyst Mark Greenwood, said it was now  more realistic  that the Origin and ConocoPhillips Gladstone APLNG project would produce only half its initial expected output, while it downgraded Woodside to a  sell  based on its hefty LNG portfolio and rising project costs.
Asian buyers are indicating they have nearly had their fill of LNG, the one-time market darling, amid a flurry of multibillion-dollar off-take agreements struck over the past two years.
But while LNG prices are falling, Citi believes all 16 big LNG projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea could still provide an initial rate of return above 10 per cent.
 New LNG contracts are being signed at increasing discounts to oil parity. There is an abundance of proposed capacity, and numerous LNG projects competing head-to-head for LNG contracts,  Mr Greenwood told clients.
The report also:
â– Predicts Origin's LNG project will miss a final investment decision this year amid growing difficulty in securing a buyer and will focus on developing one train of LNG initially instead of two.
â– Expects Woodside to fail in meeting its 2012 timeline for a final investment decision on the Browse project in Western Australia. Citi has lowered its price target for the company by 4 per cent to $42.79 a share and estimates that the government's compulsory acquisition process could take up to two years.
â– Believes Environment Minister Tony Burke will grant environmental approval later this month for the BG and Santos Gladstone LNG projects, with the companies then  near certain  to produce a positive final investment decision.
â– Says there is a possibility that East Timor could agree to Woodside's Sunrise project being developed through a floating LNG platform if the  Australian government could broker a deal whereby jobs were created via an asylum seeker detention centre located in Timor .
â– Anticipates that Shell will try to arrange an asset deal with Nexus Energy to include the Crux gas reserves in its Prelude LNG project.
But the biggest question marks in Australia hang over Origin and Woodside, Mr Greenwood said.
He said the most likely buyers for Origin's APLNG project, Japan's Tepco and Tokyo Gas, had since signed deals with Chevron's Wheatstone and BG's Queensland Curtis LNG, leaving Origin behind its counterparts in Gladstone.
 APLNG is now considering a one-train final investment decision given lack of demand, and this is the first sign we have had for years that supply may be delayed because of demand rather than supply side factors,  Mr Greenwood said.
Woodside shares dropped 49Â¢ to $44.48, while Origin shed 1Â¢ to $15.94.
Origin said it had not changed its focus away from a two-train project. Woodside declined to comment.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"ORIGIN Energy and its joint venture partner ConocoPhillips could halve the initial stage of their Queensland liquefied natural gas project because of a lack of customer demand.
A Citigroup LNG report, led by Mark Greenwood, said Origin and Conoco were considering a one-train financial investment decision (FID) initially, instead of two trains, as was originally forecast for its $35 billion Asia-Pacific LNG project.
 ``We take this as a sign that customers have ample choice currently, and are not compelled to secure supply,'' Mr Greenwood said in the research note.
APLNG was previously targeting a two-train FID. However, given the challenging market environment, Citi said it was more realistic for APLNG to FID a single train development by mid 2011, to produce first LNG in late 2015.
The report said the first signs of project delays because of a lack of customers were starting to emerge, with the research note pointing to Origin's ``subtle'' change in its wording around its FID date for its Gladstone project.
``Origin is now saying that APLNG will be `ready' for financial investment decision at the end of CY10, pending customer offtake agreements,'' the report said.
Origin yesterday dismissed the research, saying the joint venture had not considered completing a FID for one train only.
The company pointed to previous comments by chief executive Grant King, who said the project was a two-train-plus project, which was what the company was working towards.
A list of LNG projects are planned for Queensland and Western Australia, prompting increasing market talk that consolidation is needed in the sector.
Mr King said in August that Origin could be interested in combining APLNG with a rival project by BG Group, to save costs and accelerate development.
He also flagged that Origin expected to sell equity in the APLNG joint venture to any foundation customers.
Citi's report found that another sign the market was shifting in favour of buyers was the increasing equity stakes provided to foundation customers that signed up for LNG offtake, a feature that was not seen in 2007 or early 2008.
ConocoPhillips could be reluctant to farm down equity to customers at a material discount to the price it paid in 2008, which could hurt the joint venture's chances of securing offtake contracts, the report found.
The APLNG joint venture was originally targeting Tokyo Gas and Tepco as potential foundation customers, as ConocoPhillips historically had good relationships with them. But they have instead signed with rival projects.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"LACK of market demand could see Origin Energy and its partner, US giant ConocoPhillips, kick off their proposed Gladstone liquefied natural gas venture with a smaller operation than they once hoped, according to Citigroup analysts.
Many analysts believe demand for LNG from Asian markets over the next few years will fall short of the optimistic projections of a couple of years ago or be overwhelmed by the plethora of competitive projects under way or on the drawing board in Australia and Papua New Guinea.
 Now Citigroup has suggested Origin and Conoco may have to settle for a slower single-processing plant (or train) start-up for their Australia Pacific LNG project at Gladstone, rather than the two-train plant they were initially targeting.
``APLNG is now considering a one-train FID (final investment decision) given lack of demand and this is the first sign we have had for years that supply may be delayed because of demand rather than supply-side factors,'' Citigroup said in an assessment of the long queue of Australian LNG projects.
``APLNG was previously targeting a two-train final investment decision by late this year or early in 2011.
``However, given the challenging market environment, we expect it is more realistic for Origin and Conoco's APLNG to (make a FID for a) single-train development by mid-2011, to produce first LNG in late 2015,'' Citigroup said.
Origin and Conoco are yet to sign any customers for the planned APLNG project, unlike competitors BG Group, Santos/Petronas and Shell - which are also planning plants on Curtis Island off Gladstone.
BG and Santos, with customers on board, are both hopeful of committing to two-train developments before year's end, with the nod of new Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke their only remaining hurdle.
Mr Burke recently deferred his decision on those two projects - each expected to cost at least $15 billion - until October 22.
However, analysts believe they will get the nod, subject to strict monitoring of the huge volumes of water that will be produced as a byproduct of the production of the coal seam gas which will be processed at Curtis Island.
Citigroup said it believed go-aheads for BG's Queensland Curtis LNG and Santos's Gladstone LNG, in which France's Total recently took a stake, were still possible by the end of the year.
It also likes APLNG's ``fundamentals'' - Origin/Conoco have the biggest coal seam gas reserves in Queensland.
But the analysts say: ``We think a one-train FID is most probable initially, given lack of market demand.''
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Origin Energy has reaffirmed plans to develop a full-scale liquefied natural gas facility at its Australia Pacific LNG venture in Queensland in the face of mounting speculation it could be forced to reduce its ambitions.
Origin yesterday pointed to bullish long-term forecasts for LNG markets to underpin its plan for an initial two-train development at Gladstone, building to a four-train facility costing as much as $35 billion.
 Citigroup analysts led by Mark Greenwood said yesterday the APLNG partners, Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips, were considering building the project as an initial one-train, or processing line, development.
APLNG has to date failed to lock in any customers for the development, raising questions over whether Origin and Conoco will meet their schedules for the project.
Origin and Conoco had been targeting a final investment decision on the first two trains by the end of this year, before first LNG production from the project by 2014.
Mr Greenwood said the inability of the APLNG partners to secure customers to date as a result of weak demand meant a smaller development was now likely.
 APLNG is now considering a one-train [final investment decision] given lack of demand, and this is the first sign we have had for years that supply may be delayed because of demand rather than supply-side factors,  Mr Greenwood said.
APLNG, he said, was likely to only approve the smaller LNG project in mid-2011 with first production not expected until late 2015.
Origin hit back at the suggestions, reiterating the company's commitment to an initial two-train development. A single-train project was  not a matter that has been considered by the Australia Pacific LNG joint venture , the company said.
At the company's recent full-year results, chief executive Grant King said:  In my view, there's a two-train-plus project and that's what we're working towards. 
Origin executive director Karen Moses yesterday told investors in Asia that Asian LNG demand was continuing to grow, with the projected fall in supply from existing LNG projects in Indonesia and Malaysia in coming years to open up a substantial LNG demand.
 The outlook for contract extensions from the established 'bedrock' supply projects is deteriorating and buyers may look to new projects for long-term supply,  Ms Moses said.
 While the market has softened, recent contracts for post-2014 LNG sales have been struck at close to oil price parity.  Origin also pointed to recent data from consultancy group Energy Quest, which found that June-quarter LNG demand had increased 21.8 per cent year on year. That included an 8.7 per cent increase in imports from the world's biggest LNG buyer, Japan, and an 89.1 per cent rise from China.
Of the four most advanced LNG projects under consideration in Queensland, APLNG is the only one to date yet to secure a buyer. With LNG projects costing several billion dollars to build, committed long-term customers are necessary before a project can go ahead.
Mr Greenwood said it was unlikely the buyers originally targeted by APLNG, Tokyo Gas and Tepco, would sign up to the project given their commitments to other LNG projects.
He said the project was more likely to secure the likes of China's Sinopec and India's Petronet as customers for an initial single-train development.
Shares in Origin closed down 1Â¢ to $15.94.
KEY POINTS APLNG has been unable to lock in customers for the development. Origin and Conoco were looking at a final two-train decision by year's end. Origin is determined to go ahead with the larger LNG project.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"It's almost a month since Santos finally confirmed officially what the market had known for the best part of half a year â€“ it was in talks with Korea Gas.
Santos's decision to publicly acknowledge the talks â€“ which revolve around Kogas buying a 10 per cent stake in Santos' Gladstone liquefied natural gas project as well as making a long-term commitment to buy LNG from the project â€“ was interpreted as a sign of increased confidence on Santos's behalf that a deal was imminent.
 That confidence was helped after Kogas went out and raised $280 million, a sum that would go a long way to covering the $430 million Kogas is likely to have to pay for its share in GLNG (assuming it pays no more than the $860 million Total paid last month for a 20 per cent stake). Despite all that anticipation, we're still yet to see the deal. Santos and its shareholders have the right to grow fairly frustrated about the apparent lack of progress, although at this stage at least there's little sign of that happening.
But the potential deal would seem to have become sufficiently protracted to raise questions of the overall intentions of Kogas and its owner, the Korean government. Apparently, the delays are all due to the Korean government studying the merits of the deal.
You have to wonder if the Koreans aren't also trying to leverage their position in the hope of securing a better price, either for the LNG, the 10 per cent stake or both. Santos is now just over two months from a final investment decision on GLNG, leaving it little room to engineer another deal if indeed the Kogas agreement fell over. Santos chief David Knox said two weeks ago the Kogas deal wasn't a prerequisite for approving GLNG. But there's no doubt the market â€“ and probably Knox himself â€“ would feel a lot more comfortable having an established LNG buyer on board at GLNG.
Whether Kogas see Knox's stance as a bluff could determine just how quickly the Koreans get the GLNG deal done.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The signature of Korean President Lee Myung-bak is all that stands between Santos and its final multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas Â­contract.
But the protracted wait for the President to sign off on the deal â€“ which would result in state-owned Korea Gas buying a stake in Santos's Gladstone LNG project in Queensland and committing to buying gas from the project â€“ is continuing to feed concerns over Korea's intentions.
 Kogas was closing in on a deal over GLNG almost six months ago before it was spooked by the announcement of the federal government's since-diluted resources tax. More recently, Kogas said it was aiming to complete the deal by mid-September, and then late September.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said it was  quite possible  the delay could be designed by the Koreans to intensify pressure on Santos, which is aiming to approve the $16 billion GLNG project for development by the end of the year.
Kogas and Santos are believed to have broadly agreed on the key terms of the deal, meaning any renegotiation of the terms is unlikely.
Ms Brookman said that while Kogas obviously had the intent to complete the deal, the Korean government, not Kogas, had the ultimate power to finalise the agreement.  If they did get Kogas, [GLNG] would start to look like a nice little business,  she said.
 But the last thing you want to do is to, out of desperation, drop your prices, as you then have to live with those prices for the next 20 years. 
One option for Santos if the Korean government approval remains outstanding, Ms Brookman said, would be to announce the Kogas deal as a non-binding heads of agreement. That would help the company in meeting its final investment decision timetable.
 But to do that means they cut out all the other [potential customers] because if you announce a heads of agreement with one party it does tend to suggest that's the party you're going with. 
Kogas is expected to buy about a 10 per cent stake in GLNG for about $430 million, if it is struck at similar terms to the recent purchase of a 20 per cent stake in GLNG by French giant Total. More importantly, an offtake agreement would be likely to account for almost all production from the first two LNG trains or processing lines at GLNG.
Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood said he was unsure why the Korean government was taking so long to finalise the deal.  These things are a long, long time in the making, particularly where there's equity involved,  he said.  Once they get as far as they have, the objective is to get the thing done. 
On top of the Kogas wait, Santos is also waiting for new federal Environment Minister Tony Burke to give the project environmental approval. Mr Burke expects to deliver his decision by October 22. Santos is also expected to launch a major equity raising around the time GLNG is approved for development.
Mr Greenwood said the environmental approval, the Kogas deal and the equity raising were all worrying the market.  We're pretty confident they're going to get environmental approval on or before October 22 without particularly onerous conditions; we're optimistic they can get the Kogas deal over the line because I think it's 99 per cent of the way there. On the equity raising we've said for a long time it's going to be pretty chunky, around $2 billion-plus. 
KEY POINTS
-Korean Gas's decision on the Gladstone LNG deal was delayed by the now changed mining tax.
-The project is also waiting for federal government environmental approval.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"INTERNATIONAL energy companies Santos and BG Group have acknowledged the emerging coal-seam gas industry in Queensland will affect underground water levels, adding pressure to Tony Burke's decision on the multi-billion-dollar projects.
The new federal Environment Minister faces a test of his credentials, say green groups, which have formed an alliance with farmers on the Darling Downs to oppose the new industry.
 Mr Burke will decide whether to grant final environmental approvals to Santos's GLNG project and BG Group's QGC projects in the Surat Basin by October 22, kicking off billions of dollars in investment and paving the way for two more major CSG to liquefied natural gas projects in the state.
Concerns centre on the projects' impacts on groundwater levels of the Great Artesian Basin, with the sinking of 12,000 wells across some of Queensland's best agricultural land.
A hydrologist's report, commissioned by Darling Downs irrigators, warned that the balance between the Condamine Alluvium and the Great Artesian Basin could change, forcing water out of the nation's largest aquifer.
Both the major companies -- whose projects before the minister are estimated to be worth more than $20 billion in capital investment -- say the groundwater impacts will be ``small but manageable'' and they will offer ``make-good measures'' should the groundwater table drop.
During the gas-extraction process, companies drill wells about 300m to 600m below ground, forcing briny water and gas to the surface. The gas is then piped to a plant on Gladstone's Curtis Island for liquefication.
Santos said up to 180ML a day of water produced from the coal seam could lead to changed pressure gradients in the groundwater, lowering the water table.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Apollo Gas may be one of the smallest companies swallowed by the voracious coal seam gas M&A frenzy, but its founders may be among the sector's big winners.
Apollo managing director Andrew Mayo and founder Duncan Hardie stand to collect shares worth more than $65 million from the sale of the company to Dart Energy, less than 10 months after Apollo listed.
 Their looming windfalls eclipse the $28.2 million collected by former Queensland Gas Co. boss Richard Cottee, who grew QGC from a cash-strapped minnow into a $5.3 billion giant at the time it was swallowed by BG Group.
Mr Mayo and Mr Hardie, a veteran Sydney property developer, both control major shareholdings in Apollo, which has coal seam gas exploration acreage in NSW. The strong share price appreciation in both Dart and Apollo since the takeover was announced two weeks ago means Mr Mayo and Mr Hardie's stakes are worth about $34 million and $31.4 million respectively.
Mr Mayo, Mr Hardie and fellow Apollo founder Stuart Rose also hold 45.4 million Apollo founder options that are set to be converted into 34 million in-the-money options in Dart. The trio will be allowed to convert the options into Dart shares for just 40Â¢, compared with Dart's closing share price on Friday of $1.30.
Mr Mayo, Mr Hardie and Mr Rose all control substantial shareholdings in Apollo, but will inherit far smaller stakes in Dart. Apollo's shareholders will hold about 22 per cent of Dart, making it easier for Apollo's major shareholders to sell their stakes.
Apollo's NSW coal seam gas assets were first identified in 2004 by Mr Mayo. Mr Hardie and Mr Rose picked up their stakes by providing seed capital before the listing in December last year.
The wave of M&As in the coal seam gas sector has generated huge paper fortunes. Tasmanian mining equipment magnate Dale Elphinstone has been the biggest winner, netting $303.3 million through the sale of his stake in QGC. Directors of Pure Energy Resources and Sunshine Gas have also had windfalls in the tens of millions of dollars.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"TONY Burke is considering a report that warns of the potential for Queensland's coal-seam gas industry to deplete groundwater in the Great Artesian Basin as he prepares to rule on several multi-billion-dollar projects.
The federal Environment Minister remains committed to a deadline of October 22, when he is expected to advise international energy giants Santos and BG Group whether he will grant environmental approvals for their projects converting coal-seam gas to liquefied natural gas, worth an estimated $22bn to the Queensland economy.
 While the projects have been supported by the Queensland government, farmers and green groups have formed an alliance to call for a moratorium on the projects.
Their main concern is a potential depletion of the groundwater, something acknowledged by CSG companies in specific areas.
Irrigators commissioned a report by the former technical adviser to the Great Artesian Basin Co-ordinating Council, John Hillier. It found there was an equilibrium between the Walloon Coal Measures -- where CSG exploration is under way -- and the Great Artesian Basin.
``There has been movement from the Walloon Coal Measures to the alluvium in the past, and with the decrease in pressure from the Walloons, this reversal of gradient must have an effect,'' the report said.
Mr Burke said the department was ``aware of the report by Dr Hiller and (has) considered that report in its advice to me. Water is one of many important issues considered in the assessment of these proposals. The department has sought expert advice on groundwater issues. I will take this into account when considering my final decision by October 22.''
Santos and BG Group have acknowledged their projects -- which will extract 270 megalitres a day from the coal seam at their peak in 2014 -- will have an impact on groundwater levels.
The Precipice Sandstone aquifer could drop as much as 15m, the Hutton Sandstone water table 3m and the Springbok Sands up to 5m, environmental impact statements acknowledge.
During the gas-extraction process, wells are drilled 300m to 600m below ground, pushing briny water and gas to the surface because of the pressure gradient.
The companies will offer ``make-good measures'' to farmers when the water table drops, including lowering water pumps, compensation and providing bulk water. But landholders have warned that Mr Burke faces a ``permanent state of unrest in rural Queensland'' if he approves the projects. ``If this is approved, there is going to be civil disobedience and non-violent protest,'' said Michael Bretherick, spokesman for the Western Downs Alliance.
The energy companies say CSG operations will have a small but manageable impact and additional groundwater monitoring bores have been established.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"Strict conditions will be put on $20bn worth of CSG projects
THE federal government has given its clearest signal yet that it is likely to approve $20 billion worth of potential investment in Queensland's fledgling coal-seam gas industry but subject to strict environmental conditions.
 Environment Minister Tony Burke is due to give his ruling by October 22 on two major proposals, worth about $10bn each, from Santos and the BG Group.
Approval was delayed earlier this year by his predecessor, Peter Garrett, who was concerned about the projects' potential impact on groundwater and the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area.
Mr Burke said yesterday on Sky News's Australian Agenda there were not only major economic issues but also major environmental issues at stake in his decision.
``There are three options, not two, when these issues come up,'' he said.
``There is approval, there is rejection or there is conditional approval. The way you put conditions on can be something that sometimes finds a way through.''
Green groups and some Queensland farmers in the Darling Downs, alarmed about the potential impact on groundwater, have formed an alliance to fight the development.
The projects will involve sinking thousands of wells across some of the state's best agricultural land.
As part of the proposed gas extraction, companies force briny water and gas to the surface, with the gas then being piped to a plant on Curtis Island for liquefication.
BG and Santos are awaiting environmental approval and consideration of any conditions imposed before they make their final investment decisions.
The federal government has repeatedly talked of the economic benefits and jobs that would come from developing a coal-seam gas industry in Queensland and would be loathe to jeopardise this.
But particularly given their importance in the new minority government, the Greens will object to any proposals that could see levels in the groundwater table drop.
The imminent decision will be the government's first big environmental test, with Mr Burke able to leave until next year a decision on controversial new proposals to return much more water to the Murray Darling river system.
The companies involved insist any impact on groundwater levels from the coal-seam gas industry will be small but manageable.
Mr Burke, a former agriculture minister, said one of the first things he had done was to visit the proposed sites and talk to the companies and members of the community who objected.
He also approved a brief further extension to the original July deadline to ensure he could consider all matters relevant to the environment protection and bio-diversity conservation act.
``We're talking about the headwaters of the Darling River,'' he said.
``These are decisions that I have to make based on the sites, based on the information that's put before me. I'll be following the rules of the statute on that. But yes, as a balancing situation, these are very big issues with strong environmental arguments and strong economic issues.''

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"But project forms clean transition
A COALITION of environment and community groups protested on Nobbys Beach yesterday against plans to drill off Newcastle for natural gas.
 Members of the coalition, called Hands Off Our Coast, gave speeches on the beach before about 80 people.
The protest was part of a global day of action on climate change under the 350.org campaign, which involved 7300 demonstrations in 190 countries.
Lake Macquarie councillor Phillipa Parsons, who leads the anti-gas coalition, said governments must begin the transition towards a  clean, renewable energy economy and away from the fossil-fuel economy .
 They need to stop subsidising fossil-fuel exploration such as proposed offshore gas drilling in Newcastle and invest more in clean renewables,  Cr Parsons said.
Advent Energy, which is planning the drilling, said gas was a  transition fuel as the economy converts to renewable energy.
Advent executive director David Breeze said gas-fired power stations produced up to 70 per cent less carbon emissions than coal-fired plants to produce the same amount of energy.
 We support renewables, but it's abundantly clear that renewable energy in the form of wind or solar power is not capable of meeting power demand,  Mr Breeze said.
Cr Parsons described the comments as  absolute rubbish .
 It's propaganda from mining corporations, who stand to profit from continuing the fossil-fuel industry,  Cr Parsons said.
 Moving to a clean, renewable economy is doable and the barriers aren't technological, they are political. 
Newcastle councillor Michael Osborne said a transition plan had been prepared for Australia to move to 100 per cent renewables in 10 years.
 It's not pie in the sky, we can do it today if there is political will,  Cr Osborne said.
The plan was in a report called Beyond Zero Emissions, which the University of Melbourne helped compile.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"GAS: Global ratings agency Fitch has added to growing predictions that not all of Australia's touted liquified natural gas projects will proceed, with competition for resources expected to push up project costs.
Following recent reports from Macquarie and Deutsche Bank warning of potential lower-than-expected long-term Chinese demand, Fitch yesterday said the number of LNG projects would drive up costs for materials, equipment and skilled labour and see some projects deferred or cancelled. But Fitch tipped strong growth in demand in the ``medium-term'', heating up the race among Queensland's burgeoning LNG export industry.
 ``Fitch does not believe that buyers' appetites will be deep enough to commit to contracts to underpin all of the proposed projects,'' Fitch director of energy and utilities, Sajal Kishore said.
Along with the massive Gorgon and Pluto LNG projects under construction in Western Australia, a swag of majors, including Santos, BG Group, Shell and Origin Energy have massive multi-billion-dollar projects planned, leading to increased market talk that consolidation is needed.
Fitch said securing long-term sales contracts was the key to funding their projects. Santos last month became the latest to strike such a deal, securing the sale of 1.5 million tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years to French major Total, which also agreed to buy a 15 per cent stake in its Gladstone
LNG project.
"
NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"THE federal government has called for public comment on an exploratory gas drilling plan off the coast of Newcastle.
Advent Energy, through its subsidiary company Asset Energy, plans to begin drilling for natural gas 55 kilometres off Newcastle next month.
 Asset has lodged a report with the federal Department of Environment, seeking approval for its project in Commonwealth waters.
It is on display on the department's website.
Drilling will take up to 30 days in 143 metre-deep water, with a well depth of 826 metres.
The report said the company planned to drill a single well to enable it to estimate potential gas reserves in the area.
There were 30 threatened species that might occur near the drilling site, including 16 seabirds, three whales, two fish, four turtles and five sharks, the report said.
 Some or all of these species are likely to transit through the area, at least on occasion,  the report said.
 The drilling location is unlikely to represent important habitat for any of these species. 
Seismic testing will be done during drilling using an airgun, leading environmental groups to raise concerns that it could cause whales to beach themselves.
Thirty-five migratory species  may occur in the vicinity of the drilling location , the report said.
The report said this included 17 seabirds, eight whales, one dolphin, four turtles and five sharks.
The drilling's effects on the species would be  limited to very temporary and localised disturbance of low numbers of animals , it said.
The project involves anchoring the Ocean Patriot rig, drilling, refuelling operations, plugging and abandoning the well and retrieving the anchors.
Transfer of fuel, drilling fluids and waste would be done every seven days from the Port of Newcastle.
The project could lead to a massive offshore gas extraction industry, with reserves in the area valued at $50 billion. Gaining government approvals to extract gas are at least four years away.
â–  VOTERS in a Newcastle Herald online poll generally supported the proposed offshore gas drilling. With more than 300 votes cast by 6pm yesterday, 52.6 per cent of respondents said the project was worth the environmental risks.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Energy and utility stocks have been overshadowed by surging mining stocks in recent times, but a handful of catalysts could be about to put them back on the radar.
The privatisation of NSW energy assets, a meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the federal government's decision on liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland are just a few of the events about to drive the energy and utility sectors.
 Since the benchmark S&P/ASXÂ 200 hit a 12-month low in July, materials stocks have put on 16.6 per cent, the utility sector is up 11.2 per cent and the energy sector 9.8 per cent.
While materials stocks may be grabbing all the headlines, the utility sector is still the second best-performing sub-index this year in the S&P/ASX 200, having gained 4.6Â per cent. The best, consumer staples, is up 5.7 per cent.
Materials have advanced 3.2 per cent for the year to date, while the energy sector is down 4.7 per cent.
EL&C Baillieu director Ivor Ries considers the privatisation of NSW's energy assets, expected to happen later this year, to be a  game changer  for the sector.
If AGL Energy or Origin Energy were to pick up the assets at a good price it could drive their share prices higher, he said.
Conversely, if they missed out or overpaid for the assets, it could drive their shares lower.
For the utility companies lucky enough to snag a slice of NSW's energy assets, the issue of funding comes into play. With the possible exception of Origin Energy, which has surplus funding of $3Â billion, any bidders for NSW's energy assets will need to raise capital.
The prospect of capital raisings occurring in the sector has Mr Ries suggesting that investors wait to see how they are priced before considering a share purchase.
 With the exception of Origin, they are [utility stocks] all pretty close to fully valued at the moment,  Mr Ries said.
Origin is unique because it holds a series of LNG assets, which are yet to be monetised.
If the stars align, and Origin Energy secures a large-scale gas sale and picks up some of NSW's energy assets its share price could climb over $20, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Aiden Bradken, representing upside of about a 22Â per cent gain from yesterday's close of $16.42.
But things could go pear-shaped for Origin if its 50-50 Australia Pacific LNG project with US energy giant ConocoPhillips fails to proceed, resulting in a possible share price loss of $6.10, or 37 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs.
The three large-cap oil stocks also have a number of catalysts that could result in some solid share price gains, which the market is yet to factor in.
The biggest, and the one that has the most break-out potential, is Woodside Petroleum, according to Mr Ries.
 It is probably the one fund managers lose the most sleep at night over because it is a big part of the index, and if it breaks out it undermines your performance. 
Woodside reported two gas discoveries in August and is conducting further drilling, which could expand its reserves.
Goldman Sachs thinks Woodside's share price could climb about 37 per cent to $61.70, from its last traded price of $44.94, if a series of projects now under way proves successful.
 We see significant execution risk for many of these projects, particularly coal seam gas to LNG,  Pengana Capital portfolio manager Tim Schroeders said.
Cost overruns, technical risks and timing delays could halt a lot of the projects that are now under way, Mr Schroeders said.
 I think what we are seeing, rightfully or wrongfully, and it is obviously subject to change, is the market discounting the potential for some of these projects, whereas before people were more or less giving them the benefit of the doubt. 
Oil producer Santos could put on about 58 per cent from Monday's close of $12.91, according to Goldman Sachs, if its billion-dollar Gladstone LNG project is completed successfully.
Oil Search is another company that Goldman Sachs has closely analysed. The broker thinks the oil and gas play could rise 42 per cent if a series of projects now under way is factored into the company's share price. Its shares closed at $6.25 yesterday.
 Ultimately I think the projects will succeed, but it does warrant caution,  Mr Schroeders said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Fitch Ratings has warned of rising costs facing Australia's proposed liquefied natural gas projects, saying the cost pressure and increased competition among projects were likely to derail some developments.
In a report to be released today, the ratings agency said Australia's proposed LNG projects faced higher costs for materials, equipment and skilled labour.
  The agency also notes that there is significant competition between projects and expects that not all proposed projects will be developed. Long-term sales contracts are key to funding,  Fitch said.
 Therefore 'first-mover' projects are far more likely to proceed in a timely fashion as Fitch believes that buyers' appetite will not be deep enough to commit to contracts, which underpin all of Australia's proposed gas export projects. 
Of the proposed LNG developers, Fitch covers both Woodside Petroleum and Origin Energy.
Fitch said the looming commissioning of the first LNG processing plant at Woodside's Pluto project in Western Australia would benefit the company's credit profile, as would any eventual addition of a second and third train at the project.
Origin Energy, meanwhile, carries a  healthy balance sheet and a strong business model , but its credit quality in the future will be affected by its involvement in the Australia Pacific LNG project in Queensland and its proposed expansion across Asia.
 Furthermore, future credit quality will depend on the level of participation in NSW's power privatisation and its impact on the company's balance sheet and future cash flows,  Fitch said.
Fitch has BBB+/stable ratings on both Woodside and Origin.
 Fitch notes that while these companies are comfortably investment grade, the scale and timing of capex restricts their ability to fully debt-fund major projects without impairing their current ratings. 
While the outlook for LNG markets has been a topic of conjecture in recent months, Fitch said continued expansion in Asian demand would drive strong medium-term growth in Australian LNG exports.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A western Queensland mayor says there are still questions that need to be answered about the development of a coal seam gas sector in the Galilee Basin.
Barcaldine Mayor Rob Chandler says up to 14 companies are exploring for coal seam gas across a large part of the region.
 Landholders met yesterday in the town to discuss the issue and to hear from one of the companies drilling in the shire.
Councillor Chandler says the impact on water in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) is the biggest concern.
 I think most landholders will accept, especially coal seam gas, I think they will accept it, providing the question of water quality,  he said.
 It's a huge problem in the Surat Basin, it's created a lot of heartache there.
 The salinity of the water, the water quality and how that water is dealt with in a fair and equitable way, that is the number one question that needs to be answered.
Gordon Saul from the Brisbane-based company Resolve Geo says measures are being taken to protect the Great Artesian Basin.
 We will do our absolute level best to ensure that we don't impact on the GAB,  he said.
 We're doing as much as we can both in terms of the initial drilling of exploration production holes using non-toxic drilling products.
 To get through those sediments, you still need to drill those holes ... and then following drilling ... we fully case off those holes with steel casing. 
Meanwhile, Cr Chandler says mining companies working in the Galilee Basin should be contributing to infrastructure upgrades but so should the State Government.
He says as well as four massive coal mines being proposed near Alpha, there are also up to 14 companies exploring for coal seam gas in the region.
Cr Chandler says the predicted energy boom could help diversify the region's economy but the full benefits will not flow to local communities unless infrastructure is improved.
 I think the communities out here I think they need to stand up and be very vocal and demand the infrastructure that they deserve,  he said.
 Now I'm saying that the mining companies and especially the coal seam gas exploration around Aramac - for instance - is a prime opportunity to help drought-proof the town.
 It's a prime opportunity to keep the hospital open.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"Play with the gas giant Woodside Petroleum (ASX code WPL), priced at $43.88, is second only to BHP Billiton as Australia's top energy producer and the leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG). When I was in Chongqing city (population 30million), 1400km up the Yangtze River in China, the only fuel permitted was LNG, which is dubbed the lower polluting energy of the future. The energy giant, 34per cent owned by Shell Australia, launched in 1954 was then a little spec, wildcat explorer drilling near the small town of Woodside, Victoria. Today, WPL is a multi-billion dollar operator producing crude oil, condensate, liquefied natural gas, domestic gas, and liquefied petroleum gas. The company yields only 2.5per cent but this is a growth not an income stock. Recently, Woodside reported an excellent first half-year result of a net profit after tax (NPAT) of $US813million, 26per cent above the previous corresponding period.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"SANTOS'S planned Curtis Island liquefied natural gas plant received a fillip yesterday when Korea Gas, the world's biggest LNG buyer, confirmed it was still discussing buying 15 per cent of the project.
Such a stake in the Santos-led Gladstone LNG project would further underpin a robust project - which is thought to be waiting only on federal government environmental approvals before committing to a $15 billion development.
 Kogas also said in a report to Korea's legislature that it was in talks to buy 9.8 per cent of Indonesia's Senoro gas project, run by Mitsubishi Corp, and 15 per cent of Senoro's LNG processing plant.
Kogas didn't say how much the Gladstone LNG stake might cost - though Korea's Yonhap News reported late last month that Kogas was close to buying a 10 per cent stake in the Gladstone LNG project for $1.5 billion.
Environment Minister Tony Burke is expected to make his decision on the Santos and UK-based BG Group coal seam gas-to LNG projects, both slated for Curtis Island, by October 22.
If they get approval both are expected to move quickly towards a final investment decision.
Their haste is predicated both on getting to market before a plethora of competing plants can proceed, but also on the fact that competition will risk pushing development costs sky high.
Fitch analysts this week said energy companies planning Australian LNG projects faced escalating costs to attract skilled workers and, in the case of Western Australia, to tap remote offshore gasfields and raise safety standards in the wake of BP's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
But while Fitch said the large capital expenditure required for proposed LNG ventures would put ``negative pressure'' on their proponents, they were also set to benefit from increasing Asian demand for the fuel - demand pundits believe will be rekindled by the middle of this decade.
``The scale and timing of capex will restrict their ability to fully debt- fund proposed projects without impairing their credit quality,'' said director in Fitch's energy and utilities team Sajal Kishore, particularly targeting the deep-water WA plans.
``However, Fitch expects these companies to continue to use an appropriate mixture of debt and equity,'' he said, to supply ``strong medium-term'' growth in LNG exports.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"AN oil spill off Newcastle from offshore gas drilling would affect the east coast from NSW to Victoria, Lake Macquarie City Council has said.
The council made the comment in a submission to the NSW government about Advent Energy's plans to begin exploratory drilling next month for natural gas 55 kilometres off Newcastle.
 As reported on Monday, the company's environment plan lists four scenarios that could cause an oil spill, including a refuelling incident, collision, subsea blowout and subsea rupture.
The company has maps of possible oil spills in its environment plan.
One of the maps shows oil could spread from Newcastle to Sydney 11 weeks after a spill initially takes place.
 This is extensive and would effectively impact the entire east coast of NSW, including Lake Macquarie, to Victoria,  the council's submission said.
It said the threat of oil polluting Swansea Channel and the lake  adds to the concern over impacts on coastal and ocean environments .
 The lake is poorly flushed and pollutants are easily trapped. 
Advent's oil spill risk assessment said spills were rare, but  it is recognised that there is a potential for oil spills to have a significant impact on sensitive marine environments .
The company prepared an oil spill contingency plan.
 Both drilling and rig operators are experienced operators and have an excellent performance reputation with environmental management,  the company said.
The council's submission said a severe storm could cause an oil spill.
It said the company's analysis  must include severe weather-induced incidents resulting in a leak where pollution is driven towards the shore .
The company's risk assessment included analysis of meteorological conditions, including an east coast low.
Recent oil spills off Western Australia's north-west coast, the Gulf of Mexico and Dalian, China, highlight the damage an oil leak could cause, the council said.
The council said Advent's plan was inconsistent with the federal government's plan to establish marine reserves off the Hunter coast.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Korea Gas has confirmed it is looking to buy a 15 per cent stake in the Santos-led Gladstone liquefied natural gas project in Queensland.
Kogas has long been known as being actively negotiating over a stake in GLNG, but its interest in a 15 per cent stake contrasts with previous expectations it would take a stake of around 10 per cent.
 Bloomberg reported that state-owned Kogas had revealed its intentions in a report handed to Korean lawmakers.
Kogas and Santos are believed to have largely agreed to terms that would result in the Korean giant both taking an equity stake in GLNG and committing to being a long-term Â­customer for LNG from the project.
Kogas is understood to be waiting for the Korean government to approve the deal.
French oil and gas major Total last month bought a 20 per cent stake in GLNG for $860 million in a deal that resulted in Santos's stake falling from 60 to 45 per cent. Santos's existing partner in the project, Malaysian state-owned energy giant Petronas, reduced its stake from 40 to 35 per cent. Assuming Kogas secures its stake on similar terms to Total, the Koreans would buy their stake for around $650 million.
A 15 per cent sell-down would involve both Santos and Petronas reducing their shares of the project.
Santos and its partners are planning to approve the estimated $16 billion GLNG project for development by the end of this year, with the project expected to produce its first LNG in 2014.
Securing Kogas as a partner would shore up Santos's financial position ahead of GLNG's development and reduce Santos's share of the project's capital costs. An offtake deal with Kogas would also ensure that all production from the project's first two LNG trains â€“ or processing lines â€“ was accounted for, reducing the project's risk.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said the offtake agreement would be particularly valuable for Santos.
 If they can get Kogas to take the remaining capacity, then this becomes a development story rather than a marketing story and that is significant progress,  he said.
Kogas had previously flagged its intentions to confirm its GLNG deal by mid-September, a timetable that was later pushed out to the end of last month.
The company is also believed to have been near a deal with Santos in May, but that stalled after the announcement of the government's resource tax plans.
Both GLNG and QCLNG are awaiting approvals from federal Environment Minister Tony Burke, who has said he will hand down his findings on October 22.
Mr Wood said Kogas's previous experiences with the resources tax meant it was likely to take a conservative approach to the government's upcoming decision.
 If I was Kogas, rather than sign a deal 10 days before the government is going to give sign-off, I'd probably just wait to see what the project looks like post-sign off,  he said.  Having been burnt once I'd take my time and make sure the project's a flyer. 
According to Bloomberg, Kogas also said it expected the nation's gas demand to increase 11 per cent year on year over the coming six months as Korea's recovering economy boosted consumption.
Kogas also said it planned to focus on short-term LNG contracts out until 2014 due to its expectations of a glut in production.
Shares in Santos closed down 12Â¢ to $12.79 yesterday.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"EASTERN PERTH, Oct 14 AAP - Eastern Star Gas Ltd says it will allow customers of its planned liquefied natural gas project at Newcastle (LNGN) in New South Wales to take equity interests in the project and an associated operation.
Eastern Star on Thursday said it had entered into an agreement with Japan's Marubeni Corporation whereby Marubeni and other LNG buyers would be able to take equity both in LNGN and Eastern Star's Narrabri coal seam gas project, also in NSW.
 Eastern Star said the agreement would facilitate funding for LNGN and expedite its commercialisation.
Marubeni would play a lead role in buying and marketing LNG from the project, which would be fed with coal seam gas from the Narrabri project.
 A key benefit flowing from Marubeni's involvement in the LNGN project is the expertise it brings in terms of LNG offtaking, marketing and shipping and their taking an active role in securing foundation LNG buyers,  Eastern Star managing director David Casey said.
 The availability of equity in the Narrabri CSG project is intended to help in achieving this goal as well as to provide development funding.
 Importantly, Eastern Star will retain a controlling interest in the Narrabri CSG project.
 By year end, a decision can be confidently taken to commence front end engineering and design for the LNGN project.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"DON Voelte's seven years as head of Woodside Petroleum, and his no-nonsense personality, are neatly characterised by the way he went about the $13 billion Pluto natural gas project -- the biggest single-company oil and gas project nationally.
Pluto, which was discovered the month Voelte joined Woodside, will also be the project that defines his yet-to-be decided legacy as head of Australia's biggest standalone oil and gas company.
 Woodside is preparing to bring on liquefied natural gas production from the Pluto field, which was discovered in April 2004, in record time.
To build it, Voelte ignored growing industry opinion that two or more LNG trains needed to be nailed down to get the right economies of scale.
Surprising Woodside's five partners in the huge North West Shelf project, which had expected Woodside would need to put the gas through a sixth train there, Voelte instead pushed ahead with a single train, confident there was enough gas off the WA coast, to be found by Woodside or others, to support new trains.
Pluto is expected to come online early next year, meaning discovery and first exports could neatly bookend Voelte's tenure, but it will be his, or his successor's, execution of its expansion that will play a big part in how Voelte is remembered.
Right now, plans for a second train look shaky, after mixed exploration success in Australia's biggest offshore drilling program.
US giant Chevron has also been undercutting Woodside's efforts to sign up third-party gas by offering deals that Voelte has called ``stupid''.
But Voelte's public confidence in the expansion has not wavered, and many are prepared to back the man who has completed the transformation of Woodside from a one-project business to one with a host of LNG projects to pursue.
Voelte has attributed his full-ahead approach to life and business to his origins on a poor farm near Omaha, Nebraska.
Voelte had a heavy-drinking and remote father, whose problems he believed flowed from his job as a newspaper typesetter, a profession in which high incidence of alcoholism has been linked to alcohol from the ink entering the bloodsteam.
His mother raised him almost alone, and although the family never went hungry, he attended school in patched-up clothes.
``She taught me to win, she taught me life wasn't going to be fair, and that you had to make everything happen,'' Voelte told The Australian in an interview earlier this year.
Voelte cut his teeth in the oil and gas business in 22 years at Mobil, which he joined straight out of university in 1975.
He took the reins at Woodside in April 2004 after three years as head of Texas-based Chroma Energy, and before that three years at Arco.
At Woodside, he has put the development of the Browse LNG project at a Kimberley LNG plant on the agenda, to the dismay of his project partners, by convincing the federal government to require investigation of a development there, rather than to backfill the North West Shelf at a later date.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"SANTOS could reduce an expected equity raising by up to $1 billion if the partners in its Gladstone LNG project agree to sell a 15 per cent stake in the operation to Korea Gas.
Kogas revealed on Tuesday it was seeking to acquire a 15 per cent stake in the Santos-led GLNG project to secure stable natural gas supply. The market had expected Kogas would buy 10 per cent.
 JPMorgan analyst Benjamin Wilson said if Kogas took 15 per cent, Santos, which has a 45 per cent interest, could sell 10 per cent and that this would allow it to reduce by $1bn an expected $2.2bn raising by the company.
To fund its share of the up to $6bn the first LNG train is expected to cost, Santos will need to tap the market for funds, analysts say.
``We have noticed investor concerns regarding the size of the equity call, which we estimate at around $2.2bn,'' Mr Wilson said.
``A reduction in equity raising requirement would be an incremental positive, albeit it would be gained at the cost of some fundamental value.''
Santos said last month that it was in talks with Kogas over a stake and offtake sale, and was awaiting South Korean government approval for a deal.
Kogas is also reportedly looking to raise $US1bn ($1.026bn) to fund overseas investments, which Mr Wilson said implied the company was confident it would get Korean government approval of the contract and expected stake purchase.

Gas networks manager Macleay Connelly launched the company's compressed natural gas self-service facility in Fyshwick yesterday. ''CNG offers a range of benefits, including being a cost-effective fuel alternative, provides high vehicle efficiency, is a safe transport fuel and is more environmentally friendly,'' Mr Connelly said. Compressed natural gas, also known as CNG, has long been touted as a cleaner, cheaper alternative to petrol. Despite a century or more of trials and development, the fuel has only recently come into wide use. The new Fyshwick CNG station is self- service and accessed by swipe cards. ActewAGL operations manager Peter Moltmann gave a refuelling demonstration at the launch. ''It takes about the same amount of time to refuel as a regular petrol bowser and it's quite safe,'' he said. Mr Connelly said, ''CNG is much less dangerous than LPG.
  It's lighter than air and disperses if there's a leak.'' CNG differs in composition from the better known liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG. LPG contains a volatile mix of gases, is twice as heavy as air and pools dangerously in confined
spaces when it leaks. CNG consists almost entirely of methane stored under pressure. Australia has some of the largest natural gas deposits in the world, yet continues to import vast quantities of crude oil to refine into petroleum for fuel. ActewAGL initially plans to target the fleet transport market, but regular drivers are not excluded. For now, drivers with a prearranged account can swipe themselves into the new Fyshwick facility and fill their own vehicle. Usage and cost figures are then available online and can be monitored by the account holder in real time. ActewAGL operates a second CNG station in Moorebank, Sydney and is investigating further sites in the ACT.

The boom in some of the mining and coal seam gas areas is hiding a major issue for other regional centres and some of Brisbane's less affluent areas - like Caboolture, where the jobless figure is up 34 per cent on the same time last year.
 Even Toowoomba, where unemployment was as low as 1.9 per cent in June last year, has experienced a steady climb to almost 4 per cent, despite the end of the global financial crisis and good rains.
Gladstone, the city considered to benefit most from the gas boom in central Queensland, has seen its unemployment jump by 25 per cent in the past year, according to the figures from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
Gladstone's independent MP Liz Cunningham said people were moving into the city thinking the thousands of jobs promised by the emerging liquefied natural gas projects were there waiting to be filled.
``People have sold their homes in Victoria, packed up mum and the kids thinking there's work right now,'' Ms Cunningham said.
``(But) there's nothing. The only jobs are in an environmental impact statement.''
In Brisbane, suburbs like Woodridge were still in the grip of endemic unemployment.
Not only are more than one in five adults unemployed in the suburb, but the number continues to grow.
Beaudesert has experienced a jump of 50 per cent, while Browns Plains rose 33 per cent, Caboolture 34 per cent and Eight Mile Plains 54 per cent.
IPA Recruitment national sales manager Steve Lines said mining could be masking the impacts because any centre relying on tourism or retail would be suffering.
Other factors were multinationals that had moved their regional businesses back to the capital cities because of the financial crisis. IPA's most recent survey of the market found that the number of job vacancies available nationwide fell 5.7 per cent in September, after a steady August.
``Certainly where they rely on tourism it's had real consequences and of course that flows on to retail,'' Mr Lines said. ``Cairns and the Sunshine Coast are doing it very tough.''
Cairns' unemployment jumped 52 per cent in the year and is as high as 13 per cent in some areas.
Mr Lines said mining centres were still very strong, particularly those that had companies like BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto involved. But the mining town of Mt Isa, which is dominated by Xstrata, had a 45 per cent rise in jobless numbers.

The state government's proposed amendments to the Water Act 2000 and the Water Supply Act 2008, to better manage impacts to water supply sources from CSG production, won't stem the extraction of groundwater, QCC spokesman Nigel Parratt said.
 Mr Parratt said adverse environmental impacts will continue to occur as CSG companies still retain the right to extract unlimited amounts of groundwater under the Petroleum and Gas Act.
 Extracting unlimited volumes of groundwater is clearly unsustainable and no amount of management measures will be able to successfully manage the impacts that are likely to occur,  Mr Parratt said.

They placed the stronger emphasis on managing impacts once they occurred, rather than introducing measures to avoid potential impacts from happening in the first place.
 The Great Artesian Basin and other aquifers will remain threatened while CSG companies retain the right to extract unlimited amounts of groundwater,  Mr Parratt said.

Santos said it had received strong demand from investors in the Euro hybrid market for the subordinated rate notes which follows a 700 million euro issue of fixed to floating rate subordinated notes on September 22.
 Santos said on Friday it has now raised one billion euros ($A1.4 billion) of hybrid capital from the Euro hybrid market and said this follow-on hybrid will be fully exchangable, or rank equally with the 700 million euro tranche.
Santos's shares gained eight cents to $12.92 in opening trade and were six cents higher at $12.90 by 1110 AEDT.
S&P's credit analyst Anthony Flintoff said,  The Santos subordinated notes are unique in the Australian market - and indeed rare globally - because they involve the mandatory cessation of coupon payments if the Santos issuer credit rating falls to `BB+' or lower. 
 The consequence of being classified as `high' equity content means that Standard & Poor's treats the notes entirely as equity for calculating credit ratios. 
Analysts have estimated GLNG's total cost to be between $15 billion and $16 billion.

Environmental Impacts Will Still Occur Under New Coal Seam Gas Legislation
 The purpose of the Government's proposed amendments to the Water Act 2000 and the Water Supply Act 2008 is to introduce regulations to better manage impacts to groundwater and town water supply sources from coal seam gas (CSG) production.
Nigel Parratt from Queensland Conservation Council highlights that despite the proposed amendments, adverse environmental impacts will continue to occur as CSG companies still retain the right to extract unlimited amounts of groundwater under the Petroleum and Gas Act (PGA).
 Extracting unlimited volumes of groundwater is clearly unsustainable and no amount of management measures will be able to successfully manage the impacts that are likely to occur,  said Mr Parratt.
Although well intentioned, the proposed amendments are fundamentally flawed due to the stronger emphasis on managing impacts once they occur, rather than introducing measures to avoid potential impacts from happening in the first place.
 The Great Artesian Basin and other aquifers will remain threatened while CSG companies retain the right to extract unlimited amounts of groundwater. We believe a far better approach is to convert the right under the PGA to remove groundwater to a licence to extract groundwater under the Water Act, which would require CSG companies to sustainably manage groundwater, rather than treating CSG associated water as a waste by product,  Parratt continued.
 In their current format, the proposed amendment's largely ignores the public interest and the precautionary principle, which must be rectified for them to be credible. Otherwise, this will be seen as yet another example of legislation that puts the interests of multinational companies before the environment and communities that rely on groundwater,  Parratt concluded.

 But the sort of project that we're talking about could have a significantly greater impact at a much lower relative cost when you look at the fact that one third of Australia's total CO2 emissions come from 12 or 13 power stations just around the Sydney/Newcastle area.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"RESOURCES - LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS
EASTERN Star Gas has signed an agreement with Japan's Marubeni Corp to advance its liquefied natural gas prospects out of Newcastle.
 Under the deal, Eastern Star will consider selling an equity interest in its Narrabri coal seam gas project to Marubeni and others, which would then take a lead role in off-taking and marketing the converted LNG.
APA Group will take responsibility for construction and operation of a gas pipeline to deliver the gas from Narrabri to Newcastle. Shares in Eastern Star jumped 3Â¢, or 3.6 per cent, to 87.5Â¢ on the news.
Eastern Star managing director David Casey said the availability of equity was designed to entice LNG buyers and provide development funding.  Importantly, Eastern Star will retain a controlling interest in the Narrabri CSG project,  he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"SANTOS was last night in the process of increasing the size of its European hybrid instrument by a further E200 million-E300m ($282-$424m), taking the total size of the raising to as much as E1bn. The original deal (through Deutsche Bank and UBS) was accorded a 100 per cent equity rating from Standard & Poor's. The lift in the size of the hybrid will mean the inevitable rights issue from Santos to fund its liquified natural gas plans in Queensland will be that much smaller. That is likely to happen following the finalisation of an offtake and project deal with Korea Gas and environmental approval.
Coal speculation
 TALK of a large coal deal is setting the pulses racing with speculation that Brazilian giant Vale and US group Peabody Coal are looking at acquisitions in Australia. Many think Vale is eyeing its joint venture partner Aquila Resources, with which it is in a rather fractious relationship. To make matters more interesting, industry watchers are also expecting Vale to at some point target Riversdale Mining, a neighbour in the booming coal province near Tet in Mozambique. The other theory is that Peabody is set to make an offer for Nathan Tinkler's Aston Resources or Whitehaven Coal. Perhaps a more likely deal is Japanese trading house Itochu buying 25 per cent of Aston's Maules Creek mine in NSW. That was well-telegraphed at the time of the IPO.
Chilean mines to the rescue
NOW they've got the Chilean miners out, we can tell you the sort of help the mine got from its neighbours, particularly the giant Escondida mine, jointly owned by BHP and Rio. It's an opencut on the far side of a major mountain range from the rockfall-affected mine. They sent two shifts of 25 miners, two safety advisers, four drilling advisers and two supply advisers.
Equipment included one Schramm 685 reverse circulation drill rig, two diamond core rigs, two drill support trucks, five pick-up trucks, three mud pumps and one 100KW generator. We winkled that information out of BHP, and a spokesman said: ``We played a minor role, working with a very large number of other mining companies.'' He noted that BHP worked under the leadership of Chilean gold and copper miner Codelco.
Let's be firm about this
WHEN'S a corporate approach not an approach? When it's not a firm proposal, apparently.
West Australian developer Cedar Woods issued a statement to the ASX yesterday following speculation the group is a takeover target for one of the larger listed groups such as Stockland.
It's capitalised at about $195 million and saw its share price touch a 12-month high this week, which it attributes to a strong quarterly update announcement released last week.
But it issued a clarification to the stock exchange yesterday following a story in The Australian, which had quoted managing director Paul Sadleir as saying the company had not had approaches.
But the clarification pointed out that it was ``firm proposals'' that the group had not received.
The Perth company, whose shares closed 3c higher yesterday at $3.18, said it was ``periodically contacted by other developers expressing interest'' in a range of matters including corporate proposals.
``If any firm proposals are made, shareholders will be provided with detailed information,'' the group promised.
Backdoor listing
IF former Griffin Coal chief Ric Stowe does come back with a bid for his defunct company's assets, and that has to be a long shot, he'll be doing it without benefit of long-time offsider Frederik Suhren. Perth pot plants are saying former Griffin exec Suhren has been offered the CEO role in a new Perth-based coal listing. WA coal is in a bit of a bad odour at the moment, what with its capacity to send miners broke and combust spontaneously, but we hear this will involve Indonesian assets on Kalimantan. Stand by for a backdoor listing.
Pokie partners take a punt
FORMER Woolies CEO and current Fairfax Media chairman Roger Corbett has popped up as a director of Halcygen , which bought Mayne Pharma in November last year and specialises in generic drugs. Is this about marketing expertise? Maybe, but it's also true that long-time Corbett mate and Woolies pokies partner Bruce Mathieson is the biggest shareholder with a 7.75 per cent stake, and might have dropped a word about possible board nominations.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"MINISTER for the Hunter Jodi McKay says the exploratory gas drilling plan off Newcastle could have great benefits to the region, but they must be weighed against potential negative effects.
Advent Energy, through its subsidiary company Asset Energy, plans to begin drilling for natural gas 55 kilometres off Newcastle next month.
 Ms McKay was surprised the company had not briefed her, given the  potential significance of the proposal .
 I would expect the company to contact me to brief me on the proposal in my capacity as Minister for the Hunter and Member for Newcastle,  Ms McKay said.
 No such contact has as yet taken place. 
Advent Energy executive director David Breeze said his company's main contact had been the NSW Department of Industry and Investment.
 We have, through the department, previously offered to brief any government ministers,  Mr Breeze said.
 I've now contacted the minister's office directly and offered to brief her. 
Ms McKay said the discovery of gas reserves  could be of great benefit to the region, providing a cleaner source of energy, supporting jobs and attracting investment .
 The benefits have to be weighed carefully alongside any potential impact on the environment and community,  she said.
A community consultative committee, which the NSW Government set up to examine the plan, will meet in Newcastle today.
Lake Macquarie mayor and committee member Greg Piper aimed to ensure the best regulatory controls were put in place and that the community received a return for the project.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Eastern Star Gas has taken a major step towards validating the feasibility of the NSW coal-seam gas industry, which has been forced to play second fiddle to Queensland.
The company, chaired by former deputy prime minister John Anderson, is prepared to sell Asian utilities a 50 per cent stake in its $2.5 billion liquefied natural gas facility at Newcastle port to secure funding.
 The NSW energy company yesterday lured a third major Japanese utility to the project with the new promise of an equity stake. It signed an agreement for Marubeni to take equity for the planned 4 million tonne-a-year facility and Eastern Star's Narrabri coal seam gas licences.
If a deal is signed, the agreement with Marubeni will mark the first international offtake agreement signed by a NSW CSG operator.
While Queensland is preparing to sanction more than $50 billion in new investment over the next 12 months, developers in NSW have complained about regulatory hurdles and a drawn out approvals process.
Typically Asian utilities take a small stake of around 5 per cent in LNG projects to secure offtake deals.
However, given the initial funding requirements Eastern Star is prepared to sell larger chunks if required.
 In the first instance we wouldn't be keen to go below 50 per cent ownership [in Newcastle LNG],  managing director David Casey told The Australian Financial Review.  We always love to own more rather than less of the project with the asset, but we do appreciate that to fund the project going forward and to get involvement from offtakers, we will have to sell down. 
Eastern Star owns 100 per cent of the planned Newcastle LNG facility and a 65 per cent stake in the Narrabri project with Santos owning the balance. Santos also holds a 19.9 per cent stake in Eastern Star itself.
The planned facility aims to use coal seam gas from Eastern Star's licences in the Narrabri region. A first production line of 1 million tonnes is slated to come online in 2014.
Mr Casey estimated the initial cost of supplying one million tonnes would be between $700 million to $800 million.  The next one million tonnes after the first million tonnes should be significantly cheaper once the infrastructure like tanks has been paid for,  he said.
In May Eastern Star signed up Japan's Hitachi Corporation and Toyo Engineering Corporation to conduct a feasibility study for the plant, which is due to be completed by year-end.
Mr Casey added that Marubeni, along with other prospective buyers, would have a lead role in the offtake and marketing of LNG from the project.  The availability of equity in the Narrabri CSG project is intended to help in achieving this goal as well as to provide development funding,  said Mr Casey.  Through the collaboration with Marubeni, by year-end a decision can be taken to commence front-end engineering and design for the Newcastle LNG project. 
Under a still to be developed gas transportation agreement, gas infrastructure outfit APA Group, with Marubeni and others, will build, own and run a pipeline which ships coal seam gas from Narrabri to Newcastle.
Eastern Star recently completed a $100 million equity placement with $25 million set aside for a 24-hectare industrial site at Kooragang Island in the Port of Newcastle for the facility, with the balance to be spent on exploration and development and further engineering and design studies.
The company's development of the Newcastle facility appears to dampen the company's alternative option of feeding gas by pipeline to Gladstone in Queensland with the Santos-led Gladstone LNG project a potential contender to take gas deliveries.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Could the new federal Environment Minister, Tony Burke, be about to delay once more his decision on the Santos and BG Group liquefied natural gas projects?
The talk yesterday suggested Burke â€“ who has already pushed out his decision from October 11 to Octoberâ€Šâ€Š22 â€“ was likely to again extend his deadline.
 While the first delay was understandable given Burke replaced Peter Garrett as minister only a few weeks before the initial deadline, another delay would not sit quite so comfortably with the companies involved.
BG Group has been sitting on its hands waiting to go for months, while the protracted efforts by Santos to secure Korea Gas as a partner would receive a boost if the environmental approval box could be ticked.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"SANTOS has launched a â‚¬300 million ($A425 million) follow-on hybrid issue to fund its Gladstone liquefied natural gas project.
The Adelaide-based company said strong demand for its initial hybrid issue last month and demand from investors had prompted the follow-on issue.
 Santos launched a â‚¬650 million hybrid security on September 16, which was increased to â‚¬700 million a week later after the exercise of an over-allotment option.
Yesterday's announcement will bring the total to â‚¬1 billion. Settlement is expected by October 28.
Santos chief financial officer Peter Wasow said the hybrid securities would provide further support to Santos's BBB+ credit rating.  As we continue to proactively finalise our GLNG funding strategy, it was a logical decision to return to the euro hybrid market and further reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount of potential equity that may be required to maintain our BBB+ credit rating,  he said.
Standard & Poor's said the hybrid notes would be treated entirely as equity for calculating Santos's credit ratios.
Santos is developing a GLNG joint venture in Queensland with Petronas and Total.
Last week Korea's Kogas said it was in the final stages of approval to buy a 15 per cent stake in the GLNG project.
New Environment Minister Tony Burke is due to make an decision on Santos's environmental impact statement next week.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"SANTOS has raised another $420 million in funding for its Gladstone liquefied natural gas project.
The new funding through the Euro hybrid market brings the total amount of hybrid capital raised by Santos in the market to more than $1.4 billion since September.
 Santos executive vice-president and CFO Peter Wasow said the follow-on hybrid issue demonstrates Santos's strong reputation in the capital markets and its commitment to maintain an efficient capital structure.
Santos has yet to publish an estimate of the cost of building GLNG but analysts forecast it will cost about $16 billion.
Santos now has a 45 per cent share, meaning its funding commitment would be about $1 billion more than it has secured.
Santos and rival BG Group are awaiting federal environmental approval on their LNG projects in Queensland - expected by Friday.
BG yesterday said it ``remains confident'' that Australian Environment Minister Tony Burke would stick to his deadline.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"THE chief executive of Ceramic Fuel Cells, Brendan Dow, is a disappointed man.
Two months ago, Ceramic decided all manufacturing would shift from Melbourne to its German factory, where it can make up to 10,000 of its dishwasher-size Bluegen fuel cell units a year. The units convert natural gas to electricity and heat (for hot water) at up to 85 per cent thermal efficiency.
 Wired to feed surplus electricity back into the grid, a Bluegen unit can generate much more electricity than comparable domestic-scale solar panels. (A CSIRO study for Ceramic showed a two-kilowatt photovoltaic installation in NSW would save three tonnes of CO2 while a Bluegen unit would save 17 tonnes.)
But Bluegens don't qualify for renewable energy certificates and don't get a subsidy under any of our feed-in-tariff regimes (they do in Britain, Germany and California).  We are an Australian company - the leading company in this field in the world,  says Dow.
Energy Australia has just signed up to trial 25 units at $45,000 each. But for Origin and AGL Energy, says Dow, Ceramic remains  a science experiment ... [which] interrupts their business model .
Ceramic just raised $30 million at 18.25Â¢ a share from local and offshore investors to complete commercialisation of the Bluegen technology and, 18 years after being spun out of the CSIRO, hopes to become profitable by the end of next year.
The end game: utilities will own, install and maintain Bluegen units, which are leased to the customer on a contract, almost like a mobile phone company. The margins could be fat: gas bought for 4Â¢/kW could be turned to electricity at 6Â¢/kW and on-sold for 23Â¢/kW.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"A NATURAL gas industry off the coast of Newcastle has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs and generate billions of tax dollars for government.
Advent Energy, through its subsidiary company Asset Energy, plans to begin exploratory drilling for natural gas 55 kilometres off Newcastle next month.
 The exploratory drilling plan could lead to a gas extraction industry with the potential to attract up to $12 billion in investment, similar to the North-West Shelf off Western Australia.
The gas would be used for power stations, domestic uses and export and a terminal could be built at Newcastle Port.
Advent executive director David Breeze said its gas plan off Newcastle had  massive potential that could transform the NSW economy .
 It could be equal to Bass Strait in terms of natural gas,  Mr Breeze said.
Mr Breeze referred to an Esso Australia statement from April last year which said its Bass Strait operations had been  a significant contributor to the economic development of Australia .
Esso, an ExxonMobil Australia subsidiary, said the project had created 50,000 jobs, generating about $300 billion in federal government revenue across 40 years.
The well, planned to be drilled in Newcastle, would enable the company to estimate potential gas reserves in the area.
Drilling will take up to 30 days in 143 metre-deep water, with a well-depth of 826 metres.
Preliminary studies estimated 13.2 trillion cubic feet of gas worth $50 billion was in the company's offshore petroleum licence area from Newcastle to Wollongong.
Environmentalists are concerned about the potential for an oil spill and damage to the coast and marine life.
 There's been 1400 exploration wells drilled without incident in Australia, which probably has the strictest regulatory regime in the world,  Mr Breeze said.
 We have an exceptional record of success and safety in this area. 
Mr Breeze said he was a surfer, diver and fisherman and had respect for the environment.
The company's plan would be the first gas exploration well drilled off the NSW coast.
 The volume of reporting we've had to give to the NSW government is extraordinary and we don't mind it, we actually agree with it,  Mr Breeze said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The coal-seam gas industry says it could be at a disadvantage compared with conventional offshore oil and gas projects when the Gillard government's policy transition group next meets to discuss the new minerals resource rent tax.
Although the PTG, headed by federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and former BHP chairman Don Argus, focused on coal and iron ore at its meetings in Perth and Brisbane, attention is expected to switch to the burgeoning gas industry at the next hearings, in Sydney on NovemberÂ 3 and 4.
 Representatives of the underground coal gasification companies met the PTG panel in Brisbane on Friday. Underground coal gasification extracts gas by burning coal underground, unlike coal-seam gas which extracts gas directly from the coal seam.
Linc Energy chief executive Peter Bond said there was still concern about the new mining tax, especially the point at which it will kick in.
 The first point is, we believe, we shouldn't be taxed and then you work back from there,  Mr Bond said.  You at least want it noted even if it's not listened to. 
Coal-seam and offshore projects will be governed by the petroleum resource rent tax (taxed at 40Â per cent), but coal-seam gas companies will also remain under the state-based royalty regime.
This means coal-seam gas projects will pay royalties on their production before their products are profitable and before the PRRT takes effect â€“ an impost that will not be faced by offshore oil and gas producers.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"ELEANOR HALL: Environmentalists are calling for more research into a controversial coal seam gas mining process before it's widely used in Australia.
The process - known as fraccing - is already being used in mines in Queensland and in mining exploration in New South Wales.
 And the Federal Environment Minister is due to announce whether he'll give the green light to $20 billion dollars worth of coal seam gas projects in Queensland.
Environment groups say the process involves dangerous chemicals that could contaminate drinking water, as Bronwyn Herbert reports.
BRONWYN HERBERT: There's been a boom in coal seam gas mining in Australia. But little is known about the industry process known as  fraccing. 
It's when a mixture of water, sand and chemicals are injected into rock formations to release coal seam gas.
But environment groups are concerned the method involves toxic chemicals being pumped into the earth.
JEFF ANGEL: Now, we discover that an associated industry with mining is gas drilling, which injects a potentially toxic chemical into the aquifer.
BRONWYN HERBERT: Jeff Angel is the director of the Total Environment Centre.
He says he's most concerned about  fraccing  close to water sources, particularly on land next to the Warragamba Dam near Sydney.
JEFF ANGEL: This is a pristine water catchment, which nobody else, not you or I, could enter and pour chemicals into the ground. So why is the gas industry get permission to cause damage to this catchment?
BRONWYN HERBERT: The coal seam industry says fraccing has been regulated in the United States for more than 50 years, and for several decades in Australia.
Ross Dunn is the director of coal seam gas in Queensland, with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.
ROSS DUNN: It's a safe process, it's a very targeted process.
In Queensland, for example, only about five per cent of gas wells, this is production wells, have been fracced, but that figure will probably increase to 10 to 40 per cent, which is the figure they talk about, with expansion of the industry, subject to LNG approvals.
BRONWYN HERBERT: He says only a tiny proportion of chemicals are used in hydraulic fraccing.
ROSS DUNN: Might be one per cent or less of other mixtures, which is often largely benign products.
Sometimes there are other ingredients, which are dangerous, which are on the dangerous goods list.
There's guar gum, there's alcohol, caustic soda, acetic acid, boric acid, table salt, monomethylamine, and bleach, and there's terpenes as well.
BRONWYN HERBERT: What studies have been carried out in Australia, to verify that some of these chemicals and ingredients used in fraccing are actually safe for the environment?
ROSS DUNN: There's been work done by Work Safe Australia. But a lot of the work will be reliant on studies done from overseas; the Ground Water Protection Council, in the United States; also the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States - it particularly has done an extensive study of the number of areas, where people were concerned about fraccing leading to damage and contamination of underground sources of drinking water.
BRONWYN HERBERT: Do you think it would allay the public's concern over these issues if there was similar studies carried out in the Australian environment?
ROSS DUNN: I mean, I think these things are always looked at. There's a fair difference between how the coal seams operate in the United States and how they operate here. I mean, many of the coal seams from where they're getting the gas in the United States are adjoining or are within underground sources of drinking water, these other aquifers.
The authorities are always looking at these things. There's nothing underhanded, there's nothing hidden at all in this, I mean it's in our interest to be transparent.
BRONWYN HERBERT: Brad Mullard is the executive director of mineral resources with the New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment.
He says there's tight laws in place to govern what chemicals are used in fraccing:
BRAD MULLARD: Virtually all the additives that are used really break down very quickly and they're biodegradable. And they're mostly common chemicals and clearly where there is chemicals that may have a more hazardous effect we do have a processes in place that carefully examine the use of those chemicals to make sure there's no long-term impact.
BRONWYN HERBERT: Though coal seam gas mining has been around for decades, there's been growing interest in converting the gas into LNG for export.
The Federal Environment Minister, Tony Burke, is due to announce on Friday whether $20 billion worth of coal seam gas projects will go ahead in Queensland.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"AUSTRALIAN mining companies are using highly toxic chemicals to extract coal seam gas during the controversial process known as  fracking , documents obtained by the Herald show.
A government list of 36 chemicals used in coal seam gas extraction in Australia includes hydrochloric and acetic acid, and napthalene- an ingredient once used in napalm as well as more mundane items such as mothballs - and many other hydrocarbons.
 Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure underground in order to fracture rock formations and release coal seam gas.
The proposed use of fracking near watercourses, including a plan to deploy fracking next to Warragamba Dam, has fed concerns that drinking water could be contaminated if gas extraction goes ahead.
The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, which represents coal seam gas extraction applicants, said the process has been used for many years and is completely safe.
But the Queensland government introduced legislation last week to ban some chemicals that can be used during fracking, including BTEX, a mixture that contains highly toxic benzene.
Last month in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency asked nine companies that use fracking to disclose the ingredients of the chemicals they use, some of which are regarded as trade secrets.
One of the companies, BJ Services, is a supplier of fracking chemicals to coal seam gas operators in Australia.
A study by the EPA in 2004 found no  confirmed evidence  fracking fluids have contaminated drinking water, but new research prompted it to reopen its inquiries.
 The secrecy surrounding many of the proprietary chemicals used in fracking needs to be fully disclosed to the public,  said the director of the Total Environment Centre, Jeff Angel.  We continue to be extremely concerned about the lack of environmental consideration in gas drilling. The gold rush might be leading us to gas, but that should not blind us from the gold that is our pristine water catchments. 
The petroleum association said its members provide details of any chemicals used to regulators. It sent the Herald an  indicative list  of chemicals used in fracking in Australia, including hydrochloric acid.
Some chemicals would be expected to dissolve to safe levels, but others are more persistent.
 The large amount of salt, and chemicals like naphthalene, aren't easily biodegradable in the environment,  said Gavin Mudd, an environmental engineer at Monash University.  Also, the process of drilling and fracking is making the chemicals more mobile than they normally would be. Often these impacts are cumulative; some of the chemicals can slowly build up in the food chain in the long term. 
Industry and Investment NSW, the government agency that oversees coal seam gas and petroleum exploration, said it knew of no instance where banned chemicals were used in fracking.
The agency was unable to supply a full list of the chemicals used to frack rocks in NSW, though it confirmed that hydrochloric acid has been used.
Queensland's Department of Environment and Resource Management said coal seam gas operators would be required to disclose all ingredients used in fracking.

 It's all contained in tanks and ponds. 
Mr Zealand said the find did not threaten the future of CSG but rather it showed the fledgling industry was complying with government standards.
 The community should feel very comforted by the degree of supervision and review that we're doing on our activities, and the openness with which, when we do find minor anomalies like this, that we report them straight away to the government and the community,  he said.

BRISBANE, Oct 20 AAP - They're often at odds, but farmers and conservationists in Queensland have joined calls for a moratorium on development of the coal seam gas (CSG) industry.
 Traces of toxic benzene and toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, jointly known as BTEX, have been found in eight hydraulic fractured wells kilometres apart in the Surat Basin, near Miles in southwest Queensland.
Australia Pacific LNG has stopped fracture stimulating its exploration wells to extract gas while the matter is investigated, but says the amount of pollutants found is minuscule.
The discovery prompted calls from the Queensland Conservation Council and agriculture lobby AgForce for a moratorium on development of the CSG industry.
 It's time to stop the madness and put a halt on exploration until safeguards can be guaranteed,  said Toby Hutcheon, executive director of Queensland Conservation.
The expansion of the fossil fuel industry in Queensland is threatening agriculture, food security, groundwater and the environment, he added.
Agforce president Brent Finlay said land and water were finite resources, labelling the resource sector as a hit-and-run industry.
 This is not about the inability for agriculture and mining to co-exist, it is about reaching a balance where the legislative power is not weighted towards one industry more than another,  he said.
Australia Pacific LNG said the amount of contaminant was minuscule, and all the affected water was contained in ponds and dams.
Paul Zealand, the company's executive general manager, oil and gas, said the contamination was  very, very minor  but the company had suspended operations while investigations were carried out.
 We found some very low traces of BTEX chemicals,  he said.
 You measure this contamination in parts per billion.
 We really are right at the edges of the detection technology to find this. 
Mr Zealand said sabotage of the gas wells could not be ruled out.
 We're not ruling out anything at the moment,  he told AAP.
 It is one potential cause, but it is one potential cause of many. 
Mr Zealand said the find did not threaten the future of CSG, but it showed that the fledgling industry was complying with government standards.
 The community should feel very comforted by the degree of supervision and review that we're doing on our activities, and the openness with which, when we do find minor anomalies like this, that we report them straight away to the government and the community,  he said.
The company said it did not used BTEX, which can be used to fracture rock seams to release gas.
On October 5 the state government foreshadowed new laws - currently before parliament - which would ban BTEX in the industry.
Greens senator-elect for Queensland Larissa Waters called for the federal government to overrule the state and regulate coal seam gas.
 The Queensland government has rushed headlong to embrace coal seam gas before knowing if it's safe for our water, our farms and our climate,  Ms Waters said.
She said a moratorium should be imposed until adequate environmental protections could be put in place.
This latest contamination incident is being closely watched by Cougar Energy, whose trial underground coal gasification (UCG) project near Kingaroy was suspended in mid-July after company tests found traces of benzene and the toluene in bores at the site.
 We'll be looking for them to deal with this situation in a manner that's consistent with the way they've dealt with the UCG business,  said Cougar Energy spokesman Brad Glynne.
Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability Kate Jones said the Kingaroy incident involved an operational failure which resulted in the contamination of groundwater, whereas the pollution from the latest scare had been isolated.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"There are renewed calls to scrap testing for the extraction of coal seam gas in southern Queensland after dangerous chemicals were found in exploration wells in the Surat Basin.
Routine testing by Australia Pacific LNG found traces of four toxic chemicals, including benzene and toluene, in their wells.
 A coal gasification pilot near Kingaroy on the Darling Downs was put on hold in July after the same chemicals were found in water supplies there.
Coal gasification has been hailed as the next big money spinner for Australia's energy companies.
But in southern Queensland four toxic chemicals, known as BTEX, are plaguing the exploration projects.
Australia Pacific LNG has found traces of the dangerous combination in eight out of 17 wells in the Surat Basin, west of the Darling Downs.
Company spokesman Paul Zealand says it is a mystery how the chemicals got there.
 In that extraction process we do inject some chemicals into the wells but the suppliers of our chemicals have assured us that those chemicals don't contain BTEX,  he said.
 It's been a big surprise to us to find this and that's why we've undertaken the investigation regime we're now doing. 
Mr Zealand says the chemicals were only found in water that feeds into secure pools and tanks and no water courses or livestock are at risk.
He says a very small amount was detected.
 If you think of an Olympic-sized swimming pool, which would contain 1.5 million litres of water, then the equivalent amount of chemical contained in there would be about half a cup,  he said.
Environmental campaigner Drew Hutton say it is worrying that the same toxic combination would show up in the Surat Basin after it was detected at the project near Kingaroy.
 This process has gone wrong,  he said.
 There should not be those chemicals in the fluids that are coming up from the wells and the fact that it's in eight wells shows there's some sort of pattern going on here.
 We need to get to the bottom of it and if somebody has done the wrong thing then they need to be held to account for it. 
Mr Hutton says it is another sign that all coal gasification projects should be put on hold until it is deemed safe.
The Queensland Government has ordered independent testing of the company's wells and says it must find out where the chemicals came from.
Australia Pacific LNG says it suspended activity in the parts of the project where the toxins were found.
Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown says it is encouraging the company informed local and State Governments promptly.
 The company has done what the community and the Government has asked of them to do,  he said.
 The Government has fulfilled their commitment by notifying the landholders and concerned communities, including local authorities, so the process is working well. 
But Mr Hutton says the latest detection of BTEX should be a warning to all levels of Government and anyone living near the wells.
 These are exploration wells - if we haven't got it right from day one we're likely to find all sorts of damage being caused to the environment,  he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"FLOAT prospect QR National may be best known for its coal haulage, but over the next 10 months its freight arm will be delivering tonnes of very large pipe to central and southern Queensland.
QR announced yesterday that its specialist bulk freight subsidiary, ARG, had signed a rail haulage contract with coal seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas proponent QGC to move 260,000 tonnes of pipe from the ports at Brisbane and Gladstone.
 The deal with QGC came as stock brokers were today due to place their ``firm'' orders from which they will service retail demand for QR shares - which will provide an indication of how confident they are about their retail clients' enthusiasm, or otherwise, for the $7 billion QR float.
The pipe ARG will transport, initially to ``lay down'' areas along the route of the proposed QGC pipeline, will transport the BG Group subsidiary's coal seam gas to Curtis Island in Gladstone to feed the group's proposed LNG plant.
QGC, and fellow LNG proponent Santos, were this week awaiting a decision, due on Friday, by Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke on whether their projects can proceed.
Ministerial approval is the last major hurdle to both LNG proponents taking final investment decisions to proceed.
While BG is yet to do that, it took the decision earlier this year to order the pipe it will need to connect its gas fields to Gladstone, so building the pipeline could proceed quickly once a final investment decision was made.
ARG group general manager bulk east, Chris Gregg, said yesterday ARG would operate four trains a week from the Port of Brisbane to Miles and seven from the Port of Gladstone to Biloela.
The deal will be a boon to ARG, QR's bulk (non coal) freight division, which contributed $714 million in revenue - nearly three quarters of QR's freight revenue - from transporting about 60 million tonnes of iron ore, other minerals, agricultural products and mining and industry inputs in the year to June 2010.
``This is an exciting development as it represents the first time we have tapped into the burgeoning new coal seam methane industry in Queensland,'' Mr Gregg said.
``We are delighted to sign this contract because it keeps more trucks off the road with consequent benefits for local communities as well as leveraging off rail's advantages as a clean, safe and energy efficient transport mode.''

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Queensland's $50 billion coal seam gas industry has been rocked after cancer-causing chemicals were detected at Origin Energy wells.
Origin said late yesterday it had halted exploration drilling at one of its projects near Miles, 300 km west of Brisbane, after cancer-causing agents known as BTEX were detected in Â­surface water during routine testing.
 The detection of the chemicals, which the Queensland government last week moved to ban, comes just days before federal Environment Minister Tony Burke is due to make his decision on whether to approve the rival coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas projects of Adelaide-based Santos and England's BG Group.
His predecessor, Peter Garrett, had earlier deferred his decision on the projects, citing concerns over the long-term impacts of the industry on water resources.
Queensland's coal seam gas sector has been identified by the Bligh government as a major source of potential economic growth, with the industry expected to support tens of billions of dollars in investment.
The rapid growth of the coal seam gas industry has attracted major investments from some of the world's largest oil and gas companies, with BG, Royal Dutch Shell, Petronas, ConocoPhillips and Total collectively investing around $20 billion in Queensland's coal seam gas projects.
The detection of the same BTEX chemicals in groundwater at Cougar Energy's Kingaroy underground coal gasification project earlier this year prompted the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management to order the immediate shutdown of the project, forcing Cougar to lay off the bulk of its staff.
The Origin exploration wells where the chemical was detected sit in the Western Downs region, where local landowner opposition to the coal seam gas sector has been particularly vocal.
Origin said the reporting of the levels was not mandatory, but it had disclosed the readings and shut down work at 17 coal seam gas exploration wells as a precaution while the issue was investigated.
BTEX comprises benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, chemicals commonly found in petrol and oil. Origin confirmed that the liquids used to fracture its coal seams did not contain BTEX. One theory is that lubricating oils used in the drilling process could have leaked into water at the well head.
According to Origin, the BTEX levels in the water ranged from 1 to 100 parts per billion, a level understood to pose no health risks. The surface water at the wells is a brine unsuitable for drinking or other applications.
Yesterday's revelation comes at a sensitive time for Santos, which on top of trying to secure federal environmental approval is also looking to lock in a deal to sell a stake in its Gladstone LNG project to Korea Gas.
Korea Gas had planned to invest in GLNG back in May, but the plans were set back by the surprise announcement of the federal government's since-abandoned resources super profits tax. The company is believed to be waiting on Korean government approval before it can confirm its new investment in GLNG, which had been expected to net Santos and its partners around $650 million.
Origin said the water in question was in lined and fenced ponds and had been isolated from watercourses and livestock.
The Queensland Minister for Sustainability and Climate Change, Kate Jones, and the state's environmental regulator have both been briefed by Origin on the situation.
The acreage in question is 100 per cent owned by Australia Pacific LNG, a 50-50 joint venture between Origin Energy and United States company ConocoPhillips.
Origin's Paul Zealand said APLNG was consulting with relevant landowners and the community.
 The fracture stimulation of exploration wells will only continue on a satisfactory resolution,  he said.
 All evidence available to Australia Pacific LNG indicates there has been no impact on surrounding landholder bores. The company will undertake further testing in consultation with landholders in the coming days. 
Origin said it had no mandatory requirement to disclose the test results but had done so as a precaution.
While the BTEX readings were found in eight exploration wells on the project, Origin has stopped work on all 17 exploration wells.
The long-term impact of the coal seam gas industry on water has long been a key concern for stakeholders in the region, with the Western Downs Alliance campaigning against the industry.
The opponents to the sector are likely to seize upon Origin's announcement as a reason for Mr Burke to at least defer his decision on the BG and Santos projects until more is known about the cause of the chemical detection.
Queensland's rapidly growing coal seam gas industry is ultimately expected to involve thousands of wells across the Surat and Bowen Basins.
The wells work by Â­extracting water from the coal seams, altering the pressure and allowing the gas to flow to the surface.
The thousands of wells planned are forecast to extract to the surface up to 420 megalitres a day of mostly brackish ground water, only slightly less than the entire average daily water consumption of Brisbane.
Mr Garrett originally deferred his decision on whether to approve the Santos and BG projects in order to further study the long-term impact of the industry on water supplies.
At present, Mr Burke is aiming to announce his decision on the Santos and BG projects by Friday.
The Queensland government has already granted environmental approval to both Santos and BG, although the state's Co-ordinator-General raised a number of concerns about the potential impacts of the developments.
To date, the companies have suggested using the extracted water on crops, or treating it via reverse osmosis for eventual disposal.
The Co-ordinator-General's Â­report raised concerns about the long-term impact on the water table and waterways.
The announcement of the readings came after the market had closed. Origin shares had earlier ended the day up 18Â¢ to $16.29 while Santos shares were down 10Â¢ to $12.74.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Comment
The detection of carcinogenic chemicals during routine testing of fluids from coal seam gas wells in Queensland owned by Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips could hardly have come at a worse time for the state's burgeoning liquefied natural gas industry.
 Over $30 billion of investment in ventures led by BG Group and Santos, due to be ruled on by Environment Minister Tony Burke later this week, now look certain to be delayed, while the development of the whole coal seam gas-based LNG sector is at risk of being stopped in its tracks.
Alarm bells had already been ringing among farmers who had been concerned about the industry's environmental impact on water supplies.
Now any approvals for the huge projects will be impossible until the regulatory authorities are convinced there is no possibility of groundwater contamination. And that could take a while, judging by the unhappy experience of Cougar Energy, which is fighting for its very survival after the same chemicals were found in groundwater at its flagship Kingaroy underground coal gasification project in Queensland, which remains suspended.
At the very least, BG's Queensland Curtis project and Santos's Gladstone LNG project face much closer scrutiny of the environmental impacts of their proposed operations before they will get the go-ahead. That makes the chances of the ventures meeting their targeted final investment decisions (FIDs) later this year seem remote.
Likewise for the Australia Pacific LNG venture by Origin and ConocoPhillips, although that was always seen a long shot for FID this year.
The fourth major project, planned by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina, has a little more leeway in terms of timing, with FID not expected until about 2013.
As Origin and Conoco do not use the chemicals in their drilling fluids, it seems the contamination may be coming from elsewhere. But it is hard to see much progress towards development of the massive ventures â€“ which involve the drilling of thousands of wells across farmland in the Surat and Bowen Basins â€“ until there is a lot more clarity.
The impact of a faltering in the CSG-LNG industry is far-reaching, stretching across the LNG market worldwide. Planned export destinations for Queensland LNG span China, Malaysia, Singapore and Chile and are expected to include South Korea and Japan, the world's two biggest importers.
The clear winners from the confusion are the conventional LNG players in Australia, some of which such as Woodside Petroleum have made a point of steering well clear of the commercially unproven CSG-LNG sector.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"AGL SYDNEY, Oct 21 AAP - AGL Energy Ltd has defended its gas exploration program in NSW's Hunter Valley, saying the company has a culture that does not  kill people  and a long history of dealing in dangerous commodities.
Australia's largest energy retailer was met by protesters outside its annual general meeting in Sydney on Thursday, while shareholders also raised questions about the Hunter Valley coal seam gas project.
  Since 1837 we have been selling lethal products, products that can kill people, gas and electricity, and we don't kill people,  AGL chairman Mark Johnson told the annual general meeting.
 This company has the highest standards in its DNA ... inculcated into everything it does. It aspires to the highest standards.
 If and when we move into production in the Hunter, we believe it can be done to a very high standard of performance. 
AGL is conducting exploratory drilling throughout the Hunter Valley to assess the quantity and quality of the natural gas resource for development.
Chief executive Michael Fraser said AGL had the expertise for the project, having operated the Camden coal seam Gas Project, 50km southwest of Sydney, since 2007.
 In my view, we are just at the beginning of what will be a significant gas discovery on the doorstep of our core market,  he said.
 The bottom line is that if we thought our actions would damage the environment or harm the community in which we operate, we simply wouldn't pursue them until we resolved those issues. 
Shareholder Diana Denison, who has family in the area, asked the meeting whether it was ethical for AGL to conduct exploratory drilling within 450 metres of Broke Primary School.
 We believe we are using safe processes. They are monitored and reported on to the highest standards,  Mr Johnson said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Dozens of people have protested outside gas company AGL's annual general meeting in Sydney to call for greater controls on coal-seam gas exploration in the Hunter Valley.
The Hunter Protection Alliance is concerned exploratory drilling by AGL near the Hunter Valley town of Broke will pollute local rivers, streams and aquifers.
 Protesters want AGL to conduct an environmental impact assessment before the company expands its operations in the region.
They say the issue has come to a head with the recent spillage of more than 100,000 litres of contaminated water at an AGL gas drill site.
One of those outside the AGM is Macquarie Bank's non-excutive chairman, David Clarke, who owns a home and a winery in Broke.
He says AGL is not behaving like a responsible corporate citizen.
 A good contrast is BHP up at Quirindi, Liverpool Plains where they've paid for an environmental assessment and we've asked AGL to do that and they've refused,  he said.
 They're very secretive, they use loopholes. We want an open, transparent process so that we can find out what's going on. 
Mr Clarke says he does not believe that grape growing and wine making can co-exist with gas exploration.
 The issue that really worries us is that the possibility of damage to the water tables and aquifers,  he said.
 There seems to be a lot of anecdotal evidence that this process can be pretty dangerous.
 What we really want is a proper environmental impact assessment. 
 We want the drilling to stop and a proper environmental impact assessment made so we can deal with facts and not just assurances from large corporations who can't back that up. 
And, Mr Clarke says although some industries could survive alongside gas drilling, tourism has no chance.
 We are very dubious, we think the wineries possibly could co-exist because a winery is a production facility, but it's more the vineyards and the tourism industry.

David Clarke plans to join a protest today in Sydney outside the annual general meeting of big gas company, AGL.
Lindy Kerin reports.
LINDY KERIN: The Hunter Valley region in New South Wales produces some internationally acclaimed wines and is one of the country's biggest tourist attractions but it also lies on a giant coal deposit.
Now, winemaker David Clarke, better known as an investment banker believes the two industries can no longer co-exist.
DAVID CLARKE: The vineyards in particular, I mean the winery's possibly could co-exist because a winery is a production facility, but it's more the vineyards and the tourism industry, I mean nobody is going to got the Hunter Valley if it's a gas field.
LINDY KERIN: Central to that belief is his concern about the controversial process of coal seam gas exploration.
The method also known as fraccing is when a mixture of water, sand and toxic chemicals are injected into rock formations to release coal seam gas.
David Clarke says until there's more information about the impact, the process should be put on hold.
He's part of the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance which is calling for a moratorium.
DAVID CLARKE: Nobody seems to really know what the effects of fraccing are likely to be over the medium to longer term and I suppose the issue that really worries us most is the possibility of damage to the water table, the aquifers, which all people up in the Hunter, whether they be involved in wines, grazing, pasture, thoroughbred breeding, or whatever, everyone depends on water.
What we really want is a proper environmental impact assessment, we want the drilling to stop and there to be a proper environment impact assessment made, so that we can deal with facts and not just assurances by large corporations who can't back that up.
LINDY KERIN: How realistic is your call for a moratorium on this process?
DAVID CLARKE: Well I think it's realistic, I mean unless you want to destroy the tourism industry in the Hunter Valley I think it's what has to happen.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"The closure of an investigation into the alleged dumping of polluted coal seam gas water in Tara last year has left members of the Western Downs Alliance and Friends of the Earth group's flabbergasted.
Last month, the Department of Environmental Resource Management's compliance section took up the polluted waterways case.
 It is alleged during mid-2009, a coal seam gas company operating in the area dumped megalitres of water along roads near the township of Tara and into creeks and dams.
Reports claim that a group of people, who waded into the dam, had suffered burns and scalds from this water.
Last week, Western Downs Alliance member Michael Bretherick said he received a letter from Queensland Premier Anna Bligh stating the investigation had been closed.
â€œThe letter says the department has looked into the matter, found it to be merely dust suppression and the incident had been resolved,â€? he said.
â€œThis came as a surprise to DERM investigators who, in the meantime, have also referred the matter to relevant sections of the department and the health department.â€?
Mr Bretherick said the premier had betrayed them.
â€œThis incident shows how hollow their promises are.
â€œThey have covered up this shameful episode just as they have covered up innumerable cases of illegal pollution and non-compliance by mining companies in the past.â€?
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said it was clear the State Government was doing little to break out of its traditional role as a â€˜captive of the mining industry'.
â€œNow we know they will always act to shut down any potentially embarrassing investigations of the actions of mining companies,â€? he said.
Meanwhile the Western Downs Alliance group has been making various complaints to DERM regarding excessive noise, leaking gas wells and other product dumping since the start of last year.
Mr Bretherick said many of the complaints were either ignored or acted upon weeks after the complaint.
â€œWhenever residents contacted DERM, their complaints would not be acted on or departmental offices would take a week to investigate, meanwhile giving the company several days warning they were coming,â€? he said.
â€œThis sort of behaviour is appallingly bad regulatory action.
â€œA policeman does not give a criminal a week's warning before he tells him he's coming round to see if he has any stolen white goods in this shed.â€?

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"Traces of banned petroleum compounds know as BTEX have been found in fluid samples of eight Origin Energy coal seam gas exploration wells near Miles.
The minute traces were found as part of Australia Pacific LNG (50:50 joint venture Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips), routine testing of hydraulic fractured exploration wells.
 The company has launched an investigation into the claims with APLNG stating it does not use BTEX in its fracture fluids. The supplier has also confirmed the fluid does not contain BTEX.
Western Downs Regional Mayor Ray Brown said he applauded APNG's honesty.
â€œThey have been upfront and honest about this straight away,â€? he said.
â€œWe've worked so hard to have this monitoring put in place and they've done what we've asked of them.
â€œThey've volutnarily gone into shut down; they didn't have to that and they are testing all their other resoviours and wells.â€?
Cr Brown said while his first priority was the community, both environmental and people, the question now was â€œhow did it get there?â€?
â€œBenzene is a naturally occurring petroleum compound which is found in the Walloon Coal Measures.
â€œIt has come up on the monitors and we want to know why.â€?
An independent service provider, aimed at finding the source of the BTEX, will now undertake confirmatory testing.
Cross contamination from contractors equipment or vessells is being investigated, as too, the possibility of BTEX pooling underground.
Cr Brown said the timing of this annoucement was critical with Federal Environment minister Tony Burke expected to announce the fate of two major LNG project worth combined, close to $200 billion on Friday.
â€œThey've been very open expecially sitting on the cusp of a major decision annoucement on Friday.
â€œThey could have kept this quiet and waited until Monday.â€?
Meanwhile, Climate Change and Sustainability minister Kate Jones said the company would provide test results to government and landholders as a matter of priority to confirm that no environmental harm has occurred.
â€œThe Department of Environment and Resource Management will then assess these additional test results,â€? she said.
The hydrocarbon chemicals known as BTEX are found in a range of oil-based products including lubricating oil, diesel and petrol.
APLNG has confirmed the water was isolated from watercourses and livestock, with water produced from the relevant wells contained in lined and fenced ponds as well as tanks for treating.
Evidence available to them on Tuesday, indicated there had been no impact on surrounding landholder bores and would undertake further testing in coming days in consultation with landholders.
The fraccing of exploration wells will only continue upon a satisfactory resolution.
Last month, the State Government announced it had banned petroleum compounds containing benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) from coal seam gas operations.
Natural resource minister Stephen Robertson concurred saying BTEX petroleum compounds were not used in Queensland CSG operations.
â€œWith the Natural Resources and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2010 tabled in State Parliament we are well on the way to ensuring they never will be,â€? Mr Robertson said last month.
BTEX compounds have been used in overseas oil and gas operations during what is known as the fraccing process.
Fraccing involves pumping fluid at high pressure into a coal seam to fracture the seam and allow gas to flow readily into gas wells, although the vast majority of gas wells do not need to be fracced.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,4,"Substances banned in Queensland won't be used in Northern Rivers, says explorer's manager
THE company developing coal-seam gas reserves near Casino says it won't be using toxic chemicals, banned in Queensland last week, in its Northern Rivers operations.
 Metgasco general manager David Johnson said the company had never used the chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (also known as BTEX) which have been associated with ground-water contamination in coal-seam mining.
The Queensland legislation outlawed the use of BTEX chemicals that are sometimes used in a mining process know as fraccing â€“ the hydraulic fracturing of underground rock.
The Queensland Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy, Stephen Robertson, said the chemicals were not used in Queensland coal seam gas operations and, following the Act, were â€˜well on the way to never being used'.
This is despite reports of minute traces of the chemicals being detected at eight drilling sites in Queensland this week.
Mr Johnson said Metgasco had yet to determine the methods to be used in its Casino operations, but fraccing was an option.
â€œFraccing is a practice that has been used in the US without adverse consequences for over 40 years, so I would caution against the sensationalism,â€? he said.
â€œHaving said that, we've never used any of those chemicals and it would never be our intention to use any chemicals that had an adverse effect on the environment.
â€œThere is a legitimate issue with fraccing close to an aquifer (underground water reservoir) ... but were we to engage in fraccing we'd need to be sure we weren't going anywhere near aquifers or river systems.â€?
The chairman of Richmond Wilson Combined Water Users Association, and the Casino branch of the NSW Farmers Association, Chris Magner, said Metgasco had been both forthright and transparent in its community consultations so far.
He added that members were comfortable with Metgasco's plans but both associations would continue to watch the development closely.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"DISCHARGE water from coal-seam gas wells throughout southern Queensland will be released into the head of the Murray-Darling River system, fuelling concerns about contamination following the discovery of more carcinogenic chemicals from exploration wells in the Surat Basin.
The discovery of BTEX chemicals in eight wells around Miles, about 700km west of Brisbane, adds pressure on Environment Minister Tony Burke, who will determine the fate of the controversial burgeoning industry in Queensland tomorrow.
 Energy company Origin filed a statement to the ASX on Tuesday night in which it said that small traces of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, a compound known as BTEX, had been found in eight exploration wells of 17 tested in its holdings near Miles on the western Darling Downs, about 350km west of Brisbane.
The wells are part of a joint venture between Origin and multi-national Conoco-Phillips known as Australia Pacific LNG. The company claimed the highest reading of the BTEX chemicals in any of the wells was 100 parts per billion, or the equivalent of half a cup in an Olympic swimming pool.
But the Queensland government has ordered independent tests, and the results of these are not expected before Mr Burke's decision tomorrow.
Former environment minister Peter Garrett delayed approvals on the future of the industry until after the election following protests by environmental and farming groups.
Queensland's peak farming body as well as the peak conservation group both immediately called for a moratorium on future development of the CSG industry yesterday in the light of the admission, but a spokesman for Mr Burke said yesterday that the timetable was unaltered.
Australia Pacific LNG general manager Paul Zealand said the company had reported the presence of the BTEX chemicals as soon as it became aware of them.
``I don't think you can translate this event to a major industry problem. It's a localised problem and we will take any action that the regulator says we should take.
``The community should have confidence in the processes we've put in place -- as soon as there are issues we inform the regulator.''
The BTEX chemicals were found in water associated with the company's exploration program rather than its production program, and as such the water was not released into the general river system or consumed by animals but was kept in a secure pond.
AgForce Queensland president Brent Finlay said there should be a moratorium on further development until the state and federal governments devised a comprehensive framework for the operation of the industry.
He said the growth of the mining industry in rural Queensland meant ``the framework through which these industries are held accountable for their cumulative on-ground impacts is lacking''.
While the Queensland and federal governments are mindful of a possible backlash against the industry, it has economic pull, with the possibility of 18,000 jobs and investment of $40 billion and for the state government, an increase of $3bn in gross state product and $850 million in royalties each year.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WHEN Scott and Kate Lloyd took over the family property in Chinchilla last year, it coincided with the ``nightmare'' growth of exploration and development of coal-seam gas in the region.
With three energy company leases over their 3200ha, the Lloyd's cattle and feedlot property on the Darling Downs has been dotted with wells for the burgeoning industry said to benefit Queensland's economic future.
 But for the young family, it has meant depleted water in their bores, locked gates to their own property and land locked off for the sinking of wells.
Yesterday representatives of the multi-billion Australia Pacific LNG project hit the phones to contact worried residents in the Chinchilla area, after the discovery of toxic BTEX chemicals in eight wells.
BTEX compounds -- benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene -- are known carcinogens and were two weeks ago banned from use in Queensland.
Ms Lloyd said it was concerning that the chemicals were turning up in the waterways.
``We're in the early days of these projects,'' she said.
``To have these things popping up, it does concern us. Everything that will impact on your home, your business and your livelihood -- it all needs protection.''
The Lloyds have 18 production wells, pumping out gas for the national market, and three exploration wells on their property.
And despite company statements there would be either no impact or a negligible impact on groundwater, Ms Lloyd said one bore had dropped 10m since the well was sunk about five years ago.
Origin has defended its project, saying the BTEX compounds did not arise from its operations and it does not use them in production.
The coal-seam gas to liquefied natural gas industry is a potential boon for the Queensland government, which will benefit from the billions of dollars in inflows and about 10,000 jobs.
Under Queensland legislation the gas from the coal seam is owned by the government, and the mining company needs to get an authority to prospect the area.
The mining company then needs to contact the landowner and reach a compensation agreement, but if this cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the Land Court and an agreement can be enforced.

ENERGY
 AUSTRALIA'S coal-seam gas players were sold down by investors yesterday on nervousness around Origin Energy's announcement that it had found traces of cancer-causing chemicals in exploration wells at its Queensland project.
Origin said in a statement that it found the BTEX chemicals -- benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene -- in fluid samples taken from eight coal-seam gas exploration wells. Shares in Origin closed 1.72 per cent lower yesterday, while rival Santos finished down 2.2 per cent. Coal-seam gas hopeful Bow Energy was down 5.69 per cent, while LNG Ltd took a 6.67 per cent hit and Eastern Star Gas was 3.37 per cent lower.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said that while it was a serious issue and likely to cause nervousness in the market, there was ``little real cause for concern''.
``First, we note that Origin do not use BTEX in their CSG operations,'' he said. ``Second, we understand this well is not close to the water table, suggesting there is little risk of wider contamination.''
Mr Wood, in his report titled Storm in an Underground Tea Cup, added that because Origin had released the findings in a media release, as opposed to an official Australian Securities Exchange announcement, it meant the company did not believe it was a price-sensitive announcement.
He said it was likely to be contaminated equipment and was a ``very localised'' issue.
``Although it makes bad headlines, we are not overly concerned by the content of this release,'' Mr Wood said.
Origin and Santos have both been expecting the necessary environmental sign-off for their projects by the end of this month.
Citi analyst Marie Miyashiro said the issue did not help
Origin's environmental approvals, but added that Santos should be exempt from the concerns.
``It is unlikely in our view that (Origin's) APLNG receive environmental approval from the state until this issue has been clarified,'' she said in a client note.
``Origin's announcement should theoretically not affect (Santos's) environmental approval schedule for this Friday, however the timing is not good and, politically, this could stir up some resistance.''
All affected wells will cease activity pending further testing, Origin said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"A HEALTH scare and claims of a political cover-up have clouded coal seam gas projects a day before the Federal Government has to decide on two multibillion-dollar LNG schemes for Queensland.
Residents of Tara, near Dalby, yesterday released graphic images and accounts of rashes, illnesses and infections they claim occurred last year when coal seam gas project teams operating in the area used water from their extraction process to suppress dust.
 A DERM spokesman said the department was investigating allegations that contamination had caused skin afflictions but there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim.
The Western Downs Alliance, a group fighting against the CSG projects, said government officials asked them to not publicise the photographs until after it investigated the issue and a case against the company, Queensland Gas, went to court.
The Tara residents began complaining in 2008 about leaking gas wells and the dumping of CSG water on roads, as well as a brown, oily substance in a creek.
One resident said people had been forced to leave their properties because of stress and related illnesses, including nose bleeds, nausea and vomiting.
``I can't prove we were getting sick because of it, but it was all around the same time,'' the resident said.
Family doctors could not provide any cause for the illnesses, but warned against riding bikes on roads where CSG water had been used.
Western Downs Alliance's Michael Bretherick said that four weeks ago, DERM's compliance section took up the case of the CSG water dumping but it had already been shut down.

Illnesses pushed as coal seam gas project decisions nears
From P1
A letter last week from Premier Anna Bligh to Mr Bretherick said CSG water was no longer used for dust suppression and the incident had been resolved.
``But it hasn't. We still want them prosecuted,'' Mr Bretherick said. He said his son, Angus, 6, was covered in a rash and other family members suffered similar problems.
Queensland Gas said it was not aware of any investigation.
Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown said he had not been given evidence to back Mr Bretherick's claims and he accepted the Government's statements there was no cause for concern.
Federal Sustainability Minister Tony Burke tomorrow will decide whether the Queensland Gas project and the Santos-led joint venture with Petronas and Total will get environmental approval to develop liquefied natural gas plants in Gladstone to process the CSG for export.
Meanwhile, Australia Pacific LNG spokesman Paul Zealand revealed yesterday it could be several weeks before the source of the contamination of several exploration wells near Miles, in western Queensland, was known.
Mr Zealand said testing began at the weekend after the company discovered traces of cancer-causing compounds known as Btex at eight drilling sites at the end of last week. ``We are taking many hundreds of samples and we think this will be quite a lengthy and thorough process.''
Rural lobby group Agforce yesterday mirrored calls for a moratorium on coal seam gas development until better protection was afforded to food production.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"FARMERS near a coal seam gas  fracking  site in Queensland will have their water supplies tested for toxic benzene and other chemicals today after Origin Energy found contaminated water near drilling sites.
The discovery of BTEX - a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - around eight coal seam gas wells near Miles, west of Brisbane, marks the first time a resources company has admitted to contaminating water at a fracking site.
 Origin detected the chemicals a week ago and told the Queensland government - which is legislating to ban the use of BTEX chemicals during coal seam gas drilling - on Friday.
Most landholders in the area have been notified of the contamination. There is no known impact on drinking water in the gas field. Origin has shut down all 17 of its drilling rigs across a 40-kilometre-wide area while an investigation is carried out.
Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals underground to fracture rock formations and force gas to the surface.
The controversial process has fuelled protests from landholders in Australia and the United States, where government tests have detected harmful levels of hydrocarbons, including BTEX, in drinking water wells in areas where fracking is used.
Origin refused to disclose the mixture of chemicals used in the fracking fluid that it was using on the site. The US company Halliburton supplied the fluids.
But Origin's manager of oil and gas operations, Paul Zealand, said BTEX was not being used as a fracking fluid.
 This is a real surprise to us because we have been using chemicals which are free of BTEX,  Mr Zealand said.
 Having found these traces in our samples, I think it's incumbent on us to stop drilling while we do the investigation.
 It's not because of any concerns about risks to health or waterways or livestock. There is no risk,  he said.  We are testing water bores over a wide area but I stress that there's no possibility it could find its way into bores. 
The contamination may have come from diesel fuel or lubricants used on machinery at the gas drilling sites. An engineering consultancy, URS, and the government will investigate.
Opponents of coal seam gas drilling in Australia say the contamination does not bode well.
 We are continually being told that the process is safe but ... we can't get any information out of the companies,  said a spokesman for the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance, John Thomson.
The group is staging a protest against coal seam gas drilling in Martin Place today.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The last Queensland coal-seam gas company to return readings for cancer-causing agents from water testing is in its fourth month of waiting for the state government to lift its ban on operations, despite follow-up testing not detecting the chemicals.
Cougar Energy's Kingaroy underground coal-gasification (UCG) project was shut down in July. Audits of Linc Energy and Carbon Energy's projects were ordered after benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene were detected in Cougar water bores.  We're watching with interest to ensure that all participants in the gasification industry are being treated equally,  Cougar general manager corporate finance Brad Glynne said.
 Linc Energy managing director Peter Bond said the response to Cougar had been a  massive over-reaction , adding in reference to tests at other wells:  At the end of the day you just hope it works out for the best, even though they've been less than kind to UCG over the last couple of years.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke will announce his decision on the fate of two major coal-seam gas projects in Queensland tomorrow despite the detection of cancer-causing chemicals at wells in the state's southeast.
Origin Energy revealed on Tuesday that routine tests at some wells it owns with ConocoPhillips had detected traces of the cancer-causing agents benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). The companies halted work at the wells as a result.
 While farmers and landowners yesterday called on Mr Burke to make sure his verdict on the $35 billion coal seam gas-fed liquefied natural gas projects proposed by Adelaide-based Santos and England's BG Group took account of the Origin-Conoco test results, Mr Burke remained committed to his schedule.
 I have set a deadline for this Friday and I intend to keep to it,  he said.
An Origin Energy executive, Paul Zealand, said he did not expect the Â­situation to affect the timetable of its Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with ConocoPhillips.
 We've got a thorough investigation that's been kicked off, we're treating it very seriously, even though these are very small trace elements, and we're confident we will find what's causing this and we will have an appropriate solution,  he said.  We're just being very cautious .â€Š.â€Š. and very open. 
He said Origin had communicated the readings to the state government within 24 hours.
Katie Lloyd, whose farm is within the project's exploration area, said Origin had done the right thing by communicating the issues to landholders.
But she said the discovery underlined farmers' concerns about the expansion of the industry, and she hoped Mr Burke would reject BG and Santos's Â­applications.
 I have huge reservations about the impact on water and land access,  she said.  Until the science is in, I would like to think the expansion of the coal seam gas industry would not go ahead. 
A spokesman for Santos said extensive testing of its coal seam gas operations had not detected any BTEX. BG could not be reached for comment.
While the Queensland government ordered a full environmental audit of the state's coal gasification sector after BTEX was detected at Cougar Energy's Kingaroy project, Environment Minister Kate Jones dismissed calls for a moratorium on projects.  We're not having a moratorium in Queensland and nor do I believe that's necessary,  she said, adding that she believed there were enough environmental regulations to protect areas surrounding coal seam gas sites.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said earlier this week said she was looking forward to Mr Burke's decision.
 This is potentially the birth of a whole new export industry,  the Â­Premier said.  I want it to be an industry that gets up and running but I also want it to be an industry that is Â­governed by all the appropriate Â­environmental conditions.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"GAS EDS: Clarifies that 300 conditions were placed on each of the projects
By Paul Osborne, Senior Political Writer
 CANBERRA, Oct 22 AAP - The federal government has approved Australia's first multi-billion dollar coal seam gas projects, in a move which has angered farmers and environmentalists but is set to provide a major jobs boost to Queensland.
Environment Minister Tony Burke told a media conference in Canberra on Friday his department had given conditional environmental approvals for Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) - a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total - and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG.
 I have decided that these projects can go ahead without unacceptable impacts on matters protected under national environmental law,  Mr Burke said, revealing he had placed 300 conditions on each of the projects.
 We must protect the Great Artesian Basin, our threatened species, our waterways and the Great Barrier Reef. 
The approvals were delayed earlier this year by Mr Burke's predecessor, Peter Garrett, who was concerned about the projects' potential impact on groundwater and the Great Barrier Reef.
The $16 billion GLNG project involves 2650 coal seam gas wells being drilled over 25 years in Queensland's Surat and Bowen Basins, a 435km steel pipeline from the Fairview gas fields to Gladstone, and an LNG plant and export facility on Curtis Island.
The project is expected to create about 5000 construction jobs and 1000 permanent operational jobs from the start of shipments of LNG in 2014.
QGC Pty Ltd, a BG Group business, received Queensland government approval for the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) project in June.
Analysts have put the cost of the project at between $12 billion and $18 billion.
The project involves coal seam gas operations in the Surat Basin, a 540km underground pipeline network and LNG plant on Curtis Island.
An estimated 5000 jobs will be created during construction with more than 700 during operation.
Green groups and farmers have raised concerns about coal seam gas development.
This week four toxic chemicals - benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) - were discovered in eight exploration wells owned by the Australia Pacific LNG in the Surat Basin.
The Queensland government has dismissed calls for a moratorium on the industry, which environmentalists say poses a threat to marine life on the Great Barrier Reef and underground water, and could seriously degrade land.
Mr Burke said one of the more critical conditions surrounded how to deal with the issue of water within coal seams.
 The companies must carry out detailed planning and monitoring to protect groundwater resources, and submit management plans for aquifers, groundwater and surface water for approval,  the minister said.
Queensland Farmers Federation CEO Dan Galligan said his members feared the rapid expansion of the gas industry was outpacing the science and planning, especially in terms of its impact on water.
 The country needs these water resources for the long term to produce food, fibre and wealth long after the minerals and gas are extracted,  he said.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the federal government had struck the right balance, imposing the most stringent environmental conditions on any industrial project in Australia's history while enabling the projects to go ahead.
Australian Greens senator-elect and environmental lawyer Larissa Waters said the number of conditions showed the measure of the risks involved.
Ms Waters said coal seam gas was no cleaner than coal.
 By the time it gets extracted, transported and liquified it's 98 per cent as greenhouse gas intensive as coal, so it's a furphy to say this is clean when we have genuine clean alternatives in renewable energy that aren't threatening farmland,  she said.

  This week, we called for a moratorium on the coal seam gas and we need to pull it up right now, particularly where it's impacting on landholders,  Mr Finlay said.
 We don't know the science. Have we got confidence (safeguards) are going to do the job? No, we don't,  Mr Finlay said.
 Until the science is clearly explained to landholders and the fear of impacts on our production systems are removed, our position remains the same.

 Farmers don't want to stand in the way of development that will support a diverse regional economy,  said QFF chief executive Dan Galligan.

In those circumstances, mining areas would have to be re-pressurised or re-injected with water to stop the table water being sucked in.
FOE spokesman Drew Hutton said repressurising or re-injecting processes were extremely dangerous, complex, and more research was required.
 The government should have instead put off limits any areas of the basin where drilling could result in massive drawdowns in the water table,  Mr Hutton told AAP.
He said if the two water systems were drawn down there would be less water for farmers, and surface creeks, springs and rivers could be damaged.
 That will take decade to recover from,  Mr Hutton said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A big decision is expected today about the next phase of the controversial coal seam gas (CSG) industry in Queensland.
The Federal Government will announce whether two multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects can go ahead in Gladstone in the state's central region.
 They would be the first plants in Australia to transform coal seam gas to LNG and the first in the world to ship it overseas.
Farmers and environmentalists want the projects shelved, but the industry says it is too good an opportunity to miss.
Industry groups say the coal seam gas resources in Queensland and New South Wales could power a city of 1 million people for 5,000 years.
Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) spokeswoman Belinda Robinson says the plants proposed by Santos and the BG Group have the capacity to transform the gas into a huge cash injection for Queensland.
 It would generate about 18,000 jobs, certainly many billions of dollars in export revenue and would increase the Queensland gross state product by 1 per cent,  she said.
The coal seam gas would be piped from the fertile Surat Basin in southern Queensland to Gladstone, where it would be liquefied and shipped overseas.
Gladstone's acting mayor Gail Sellers says the plants are welcome if they generate jobs.
 Part of what will be involved in this will be training,  Ms Sellers said.
 We're looking at the future for our children and apprenticeships will be more forthcoming. 
Gladstone's Member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd, says thousands of jobs hang in the balance ahead of the LNG announcement.
Mr O'Dowd says the region will be able to handle an influx of workers.
 BG Gas alone will need about 5,000 people in the construction phase and Santos are pretty keen to get going as soon as possible too - they'll have another 6,000 too,  he said.
 They've done it before and I think we can do it again. 
The Queensland Opposition says it also supports the two LNG projects.
Opposition spokesman Tim Nicholls says the multi-billion dollar projects would be a boost for the state.
 We support the development of the LNG industry, with all the appropriate safeguards and conditions,  he said.
 We see it - in terms of investment and what will happen for Queensland - this is almost equivalent to the Snowy Mountain scheme - thousands of jobs.
 This is a momentous event for Queensland. 
The industry has been plagued with issues this week in Queensland, with toxic chemicals known as BTEX found in eight coal seam gas wells.
There has been protests in New South Wales about the impact of coal seam gas extraction on the wine and tourism industries.
Southern Queensland cotton and grain farmer Ian Hayllor says the Federal Government will be taking a serious environmental risk if it approves the plants.
 Our biggest concern is the lack of understanding of the impacts on the ground water system especially the Great Artesian Basin and the associated aquifers,  he said.
 Massive amounts of water are going to be extracted from these aquifers and we don't believe the science is there yet to understand the full implications of that process. 
Ms Robinson from the oil and gas lobby group says environmental concerns are being addressed, but they should not be allowed to get in the way of such a lucrative industry.
 This is an extremely highly regulated industry and it's also an industry that wants to be in Queensland for the long term,  she said.
 There's no point in investing billions of dollars if you're leaving unaddressed the possible risks associated with losing its social licence to operate.
But Mr Hayllor says the LNG plants raises the stakes for the coal seam gas industry and encourage its takeover of Queensland's agricultural regions.
 We're just going to see a network of wells and roads like a spider's web laid over the beautiful farming lands of the Darling Downs,  he said.
 It's just going to change the landscape and it's just so big that I don't think anyone's got an understanding of its full impact on the area. 
As part of its assessment of the project, the Federal Government must also review the potential impact of Queensland's marine environment, including the Great Barrier Reef.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"An environmental campaigner says he hopes the Federal Government knocks back two liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Queensland in the same way it rejected the Traveston Crossing dam proposal.
If the two projects are approved, the plants would be the first of their kind in Australia.
 Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke will today announce whether the multi-billion dollar Santos and BG Group projects have been given final approval.
Both would source coal seam gas in the Surat Basin and pipe it to Gladstone in central Queensland for processing and export.
The Federal Government's decision on the LNG plants has been postponed twice.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton says the environmental cost is too great and Mr Burke should say no.
 Ensuring that the gold rush mentality that's pervaded the State Government is blunted,  he said.
Mr Hutton says the Government has assessed the projects under the same environmental legislation that rejected the dam plan.
 The Traveston decision was one example where the Federal Government did act responsibly,  he said.
 It did take on board all of the considerations and it made a decision that really got the State Government - which was acting irresponsibly - out of hot water.
 I hope they do the same again. 
Farm lobby group AgForce wants a moratorium on coal seam gas exploration.
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser says the industry could ultimately be worth $20 billion.
 This is a whole new export opportunity, not only for our state, but for the nation,  he said.
 I'm entirely confident that this is a process which has been informed by good science and good cooperation.
 Obviously the federal Minister [Mr Burke] needs to take the opportunity to satisfy himself.
 He's only new into the job and I'm quite relaxed about the time he's taking.

 If we can realise the full potential of Australia's gas resources, we can reduce avoid emissions of around 180 million tonnes a year,  she says.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Caroona Coal Action Group (CCAG) has announced it is joining with every anti-Coal Seam Gas (CSG) group in New South Wales to form a new body called the New South Wales Gas Alliance.
The new organisation wants the New South Wales government to halt CSG exploration and extraction until independent scientific data is collected showing the process does not contaminate underground water, or damage farmland.
 The move comes on the same day federal Environment Minister, Tony Burke, gave the go ahead for two Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects in Queensland worth an estimated $30-billion.
Chair of CCAG's Coal Seam Gas Committee, Rosemary Nankivell, says recent developments in Queensland are of sufficient concern to warrant the establishment of the new Alliance.
 Representatives from each anti-gas group in New South Wales have decided to combine to represent any area that is affected by the gas 'invasion',  she said.
 We're hoping to have more political power and more political clout to register our disapproval of, and lack of confidence in, the science of the gas industry. 
Ms Nankivell says the discovery this week of harmful chemicals in eight exploration wells in southern Queensland is alarming.
Australia Pacific LNG is investigating why BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) was detected in eight wells at its site in the Western Downs' Surat Basin.
Yesterday, AGL Energy was forced to defend its Coal Seam Gas exploration in the Hunter Valley after dozens of protesters vented their anger outside the company's annual general meeting in Sydney.
 We will be calling for a moratorium on Coal Seam Gas and demanding that coal seam gas companies get their science right and their technology right,  Ms Nankivell said.
The ABC contacted Coal Seam Gas explorer, Santos, but was instead referred to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA).
The Association's chief executive, Belinda Robinson, says calls for a moratorium on Coal Seam Gas exploration are extreme.
Ms Robinson says the CSG industry in Australia is actually working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 Calling for moratoriums is a massive over-reaction,  she said.
 The fact is real environmentalists want to see more gas being used for electricity generation because it produces up to 70 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions than coal when used for electricity. 
Meantime, a new 7-minute DVD will be officially launched this weekend by anti-gas groups detailing what they say are the impacts of coal seam gas exploration.
One of the financial backers, Sydney-based investment banker Robert Barry, says the DVD gives the public a snapshot of the gas extraction process.
 The footage is drawing attention to some of the problems that are occurring in Queensland,  he said.
 Up there they've been told there's likely to be about 40,000 gas wells in Queensland and the amount of water being extracted will be equivalent to about 20 Sydney Harbours over a 20-year period.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"SHANE MCLEOD: Queensland farmers and environmentalists say they're quietly optimistic about the Federal Government's decision to approve two liquefied natural gas plants in Gladstone. The multi-billion dollar plants will be the first in Australia to process coal seam gas and export it.
But the Federal Environment Minister has only given his approval if the companies meet hundreds of strict conditions. Farmers and environmentalists hope that could put the companies off but industry groups say the lucrative projects will go ahead.
 Stephanie Smail reports.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: After months of scrutiny, the Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke has given the landmark projects the go ahead but not without restrictions.
TONY BURKE: We must protect the Great Artesian Basin, our threatened species, our waterways and the Great Barrier Reef. Today's announcement involves more than 300 conditions which provide these environmental protections and allow the jobs and investment in Queensland to go ahead. I repeat that: today's announcement involves more than 300 conditions.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: The BG Group and a consortium including Santos, Petronas and Total will build the separate plants on Curtis Island just north of Gladstone. Hundreds of kilometres of pipeline will be constructed to carry the gas from Queensland's Surat and Bowen Basins for processing and export.
Tony Burke accepts the projects could generate billions of dollars in export revenue for Queensland and more than 10,000 jobs but says the potential environmental impacts were his major concern.
TONY BURKE: While there are significant economic benefits which must be a consideration in my decision, my focus has been on protecting environmental matters. I've also considered potential impacts on agricultural land among other economic and social matters.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: Industry groups are happy with the decision.
Belinda Robinson from the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.
BELINDA ROBINSON: It's a very, very positive announcement. We have enormous reserves of coal seam gas on the east coast. To be able to use some of those reserves, to in particular assist the Asia-Pacific region, to a less carbon intensive energy future is of great pride to the industry and of great benefit to Australia and Queenslanders.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: Farmers and environmental groups have welcomed the Minister's strict conditions. Earlier this week they called for a moratorium on the industry after cancer-causing chemicals known as BTEX (benzene, toluine, ethylbenzine, xyline) were detected in eight coal seam gas wells in the Surat Basin.
Drew Hutton from Friends of the Earth says he's pleased the Federal Government is taking their concerns seriously but the devil is in the detail.
DREW HUTTON: This is the biggest project that we've ever had in Queensland and it's got the biggest environmental impacts of any that we've ever had. So yes it needs to be done right and there really has been a gold rush mentality associated with it up to this point including from the Queensland Government.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: He's hopeful the Government's stringent conditions will put the energy companies off for a while.
DREW HUTTON: I don't think that they can come up with the sorts of answers that he's calling for, certainly not in the near future and if there's any attempt to get these underway in the near future I think it will be breaching the conditions that he's imposed.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: Belinda Robinson from the oil and gas lobby group says the conditions are welcome if it means a strong future for the industry.
BELINDA ROBINSON: If that's what's necessary to give the assurance to the Queensland community and the Australian community more broadly that this is an industry absolutely committed to the best environmental practices then that's got to be a very positive development.
STEPHANIE SMAIL: If the companies receive final investment approval, the LNG plants are due to be up and running in four years.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"AGL Energy defended its coal seam gas exploration in the Hunter Valley, in New South Wales, after dozens of protesters vented their fury outside the company's annual meeting.
With police keeping a close watch, cries of  AGL go to hell  greeted executives and shareholders as they arrived for the meeting in Sydney yesterday.
 David Clarke, who owns a home and winery in the popular tourist region and is non-executive chairman of Macquarie Bank, said the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance wanted AGL to carry out an independent environmental impact assessment before expanding its operations. Mr Clarke said he was worried by the environmental impact of the coal seam gas extraction process known as  fraccing  and was not satisfied with AGL's responses.  Our impression of AGL is that they are using loopholes and whatever they can do to avoid addressing the issue on the community basis,  Mr Clarke said.
If AGL raises its gas production in the Hunter it would spell doom for the region's tourism, he said.  If it becomes a production area, I think it means the death of tourism in the Hunter. If you were going up to the Hunter and it was a gasfield, would you bother going? 
AGL announced on Wednesday that its preliminary exploration had resulted in big gas discoveries in the Hunter Valley, which is best known for wine growing and tourism.
The process of fraccing â€” the use of a liquid under high pressure to fracture the coal, which releases the gas â€” has brought protests from landowners in Australia and the US, where harmful levels of hydrocarbons have been found in drinking water wells in areas where fraccing is used.
AGL chief executive Michael Fraser said the company stood by its operations and its record on meeting environmental standards and regulations. He said AGL had been producing 6 per cent of NSW's natural gas resources from coal seam gas for years with little impact on the environment.  We know what we're doing, we understand the industry,  Mr Fraser said.
 If we thought that our activities would damage the environment or harm the communities in which we operate we simply wouldn't pursue them until we resolved those issues. 
He said natural gas resources, such as those in the Hunter, were vital if the energy industry was to move to a low-carbon future.
Chairman Mark Johnson promised compensation for any damage resulting from AGL's coal seam gas activities.
AGL said it expected its underlying net profit to rise more than 10 per cent this year to between $450 million and $480 million.
The company reiterated its plans to participate in the privatisation bid for NSW's electricity assets but only if the  price was right . Mr Fraser said AGL would conduct a rights issue to shareholders to raise capital if its bid was successful.

Mayor Ray Brown was extremely surprised to only be notified of the move in an email from QGC's Vice President Brett Smith late Tuesday.
 The Dalby Herald learnt of the deliveries in a statement from QGC on Wednesday.
â€œDoes this mean that QGC know something that the general populace of Australia doesn't?â€? Cr Brown asked yesterday.
â€œIf they're trying to force the Federal Government's hand for a favourable decision, then I don't like the way they do business.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,4,"Activists alarmed at revelations
The first company granted approval by the Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) to pump treated Coal Seam Gas (CSG) water back into Queensland's waterways has had a spanner thrown in the works with the revelation that carcinogens have been found in its exploration wells near Miles.
 Climate Change and Sustainability Minister Kate Jones' office released a statement Tuesday afternoon confirming Australia Pacific LNG had briefed the State Government on the detection of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) in eight of 17 hydraulically fractured or â€œfraccedâ€? wells.
BTEX is commonly found in oil, diesel and petrol but can be naturally occurring.
Minister Jones said the company, which is a joint venture between Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips, had advised that there in no evidence of environmental harm or risk to landholder bores.
The company confirmed in a statement that â€œwater produced from the relevant wells is contained in lined and fenced ponds and tanks for treating...it is isolated from water courses and livestockâ€?.
It also said that BTEX is not used in its fraccing fluids and that it had ceased fraccing until a satisfactory resolution is achieved.
But Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown wasn't so complacent.
â€œWhile I'm pleased that this admission has shown the companies and government have listened to our communities' demands for proper testing and regulation and that the monitoring side of the system appears to be working well, this discovery is still alarming,â€? Cr Brown said.
â€œIf this is a natural occurrence, then how come we haven't seen it across all of them?â€? he asked.
Basin Sustainability Alliance (BSA) Chair Ian Hayllor said the announcement had rocked BSA's already limited confidence in the EIS process to the core.
â€œBSA is very concerned about the announcement it (BTEX) is a carcinogen and the real concern is that they (Origin Energy) don't know where it's come from,â€? Mr Hayllor said.
â€œThey've supposedly modelled all the impacts of the ground water extractions of this industry and for this problem to arise at this stage is certainly alarming.â€?
â€œHow can confident can we be that the actual EIS process, despite its 13,500 pages, is able to identify all the impacts of CSG extraction?,â€? he asked.
With DERM having granted Origin Energy temporary approval to start pumping up to 20 megalitres of CSG water back into the Condamine River daily for the next 18 months from September 20, it will be interesting to see if Tuesday's announcement will lead to a reversal or temporary stoppage of this decision.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND'S peak farming and environmental groups are anticipating the federal government will give the green light to the state's coal-seam gas industry today, but want tight conditions put on the approval.
Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke is due to give a decision today on two projects from British Gas and Santos collectively worth about $30 billion, with processing facilities based at Gladstone in central Queensland.
 Both companies have already signed major contracts with customers in countries including China, Japan, Singapore and France, and stockmarket analysts claim any attempt to shut down the industry would be disastrous for Australia's international reputation.
The industry relies on natural gas coming from the western Darling Downs region, and farmers and environmentalists had put aside their differences to fight the industry, which they say is being rushed at the expense of their rights.
Earlier this week Origin Energy reported to the ASX that it had found poison in eight of its wells, but the company argued this was a localised problem rather than an industry-wide issue. AgForce Queensland president Brent Finlay said yesterday he expected the federal government to approve the industry, but his members still wanted more conditions put on the industry's growth to ``get the balance right''.
``At the moment it's all in the industry's favour. We're not against the coal-seam gas industry, but we want to see farmers get a fairer go than what they're getting at the moment,'' he said.
Mr Finlay said farmers wanted a legislative regime that guaranteed the farmers' artesian water supplies, more open and full compliance from the companies, and a greater contribution from the miners to the infrastructure that was being built to support the industry.
Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton said environmentalists wanted no drilling in sensitive parts of the Great Artesian Basin, comprehensive environmental management plans, and further research on injecting water back into the basin.
Coal-seam methane is extracted from coal seams by extracting water with gas naturally following, and Mr Finlay said that many farmers had noticed changed patterns in their bore water since the coal-seam companies had begun digging wells on the Darling Downs.

COFFS,Coffs Coast Advocate,2010,4,"THE company developing coal-seam gas reserves near Casino says it won't be using toxic chemicals, banned in Queensland last week, in its Northern Rivers operations.
Metgasco general manager David Johnson said the company had never used the chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (also known as BTEX) which have been associated with ground-water contamination in coal-seam mining.
 The Queensland legislation outlawed the use of BTEX chemicals that are sometimes used in a mining process know as fraccing â€“ the hydraulic fracturing of underground rock.
The Queensland Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy, Stephen Robertson, said the chemicals were not used in Queensland coal seam gas operations and, following the Act, were â€˜well on the way to never being used'.
This is despite reports of minute traces of the chemicals being detected at eight drilling sites in Queensland this week.
Mr Johnson said Metgasco had yet to determine the methods to be used in its Casino operations, but fraccing was an option.
â€œFraccing is a practice that has been used in the US without adverse consequences for over 40 years, so I would caution against the sensationalism,â€? he said.
â€œHaving said that, we've never used any of those chemicals and it would never be our intention to use any chemicals that had an adverse effect on the environment.
â€œThere is a legitimate issue with fraccing close to an aquifer (underground water reservoir)
. . . but were we to engage in fraccing we'd need to be sure we weren't going anywhere near aquifers or river sys-
tems.â€?

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"MORE than 10,000 Queensland jobs and more than $20 billion of investment are riding on the expected approval today by the Federal Government of two liquefied natural gas projects in Gladstone.
After months of controversy and delay, Sustainability Minister Tony Burke is due to approve the Queensland Gas and the Santos-led GLNG liquefied natural gas projects but impose harsh guidelines costing up to $20 million on the treatment and monitoring of water and salt that are by-products of the extraction process.
 Each project is expected to need about 5000 workers in construction and thousands more in operation and today's approval will allow the companies to make a financial commitment before the end of the year.
It also will establish Queensland's ``gas rush'' as a host of other competing companies race to get their projects up and running to meet market demand.
Although farming group Agforce has called for a moratorium after the contamination scare at Miles this week, Queensland Council of Unions secretary Ron Monaghan said the projects had the support of unions if health and community issues were addressed.
``They have to hasten slowly if there's issues of health for the community. It's legitimate for society to look at it (health issues) but it's also legitimate to support more than 10,000 jobs and the development of new industry in Queensland.''
The Federal Government can only place conditions on the projects if there is a threatened species involved, which was how it scuttled the Traveston Dam project.
The Greens believe the Minister may have a ``back door'' way of doing that by finding some species being dependent on groundwater.
Federal Government guidelines are expected to ensure the underground water resources of the Great Artesian Basin and other aquifers are not adversely affected and spell out how farmland should be protected.
Analysts have been concerned that this week's discovery of the cancer-causing BTEX chemicals at the unassociated Origin Energy coal seam gas site at Miles would force Mr Burke to delay his decision by up to four weeks and stall any decision by the State Government on Origin's environmental approval.
Mr Burke said he intended to keep to his timetable but Citi analyst Marie Miyashiro said the contamination issue had not been good timing ``and politically this could stir up some resistance''.
``However, we understand the Government wants to approve these projects and wants to send a message that Australia is open for business after the resource super profits tax debacle and delays this year,'' she said.
Both QGC and the Santos-led GLNG have been negotiating with the Federal Government over the conditions in the past two weeks.
PIPE DREAM
Companies: Queensland Gas (BG Group) and GLNG (Santos, Petronas, Total).
Estimated cost: $10 billion each.
The project: Gas from Surat Basin piped to Curtis Island, near Gladstone, where it will be liquified and exported. Combined wells to total more than 8600. It will require dredging of Gladstone Harbour.
The jobs: More than 10,000 directly in construction and operation.
Economic value: About $6 billion a year. QGC to pay royalties of up to $330 million and average tax of up to $1.1 billion.
The result: One LNG cargo ship could power every Brisbane house for 2.5 weeks.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"INVESTORS remained spooked about the coal seam gas industry yesterday, after Origin Energy's revelation that it had discovered cancer causing agents in a number of exploration wells near Miles on the western Darling Downs.
But though shares in Origin, Santos and (overnight Wednesday in the UK, those of BG Group) slipped, the price declines did not support the more rabid commentaries on Origin's problems - that the whole industry could be derailed.
 And neither did the slighter declines of most of the smaller players in the sector.
Santos lost 20c, or 1.6 per cent, to $12.26 - as it confirmed it had recently had a tough time in its conventional Cooper Basin gas business because of flooding.
``Although production in the Cooper has been affected by the elements, we're continuing to see stronger production from Indonesia and the Fairview field in eastern Queensland, which is pleasing,'' Santos chief David Knox said.
Origin was off a bit more, down 42, or 2.6 per cent, to $15.59. But Eastern Star Gas was off only 1, or just over 1 per cent, to 85 and Westside Corp was off 0.5, or 1.3 per cent, to 38.
But Dart Energy - the high flying spin-off from Arrow Energy engineered as Shell and PetroChina took Arrow over - continued to charm investors and closed yesterday up 1 at $1.20.
Origin has pointed out this week that the contaminants it voluntarily revealed were in minute amounts.
Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke is scheduled to rule today on whether Santos and BG can proceed with their multibillion- dollar plans for liquefied natural gas plants at Gladstone.
Mr Knox said Santos's Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas joint venture continued to make ``solid progress'' during the third quarter.
``GLNG continues to progress discussions with a number of Asian LNG buyers in relation to further potential LNG sales and equity in the project,'' he said.
Santos also yesterday reported third-quarter production was down 9 per cent on that of a year ago, as its Copper Basin fields slowly recovered from flooding.
Meanwhile, AGL will use a depleted gas field in the Surat Basin in Queensland, owned by Mosaic Oil, to develop a commercial gas storage project.
``We have already entered into a contract to supply gas storage services to BG Group,'' it said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"N ot all the arguments between the current and former directors of Macquarie Group relate just to making money and more money. They also involve wine and methane gas.
The wine-quaffing chairman of the silver doughnut, David Clarke, yesterday turned into a concerned citizen when he highlighted the evils of AGL's coal-seam gas drilling activities in the Hunter Valley.
  The vineyards in particular, I mean the wineries, possibly could co-exist because a winery is a production facility.
 But it's more the vineyards and the tourism industry; I mean nobody is going to go to the Hunter Valley if it's a gas field,  Clarke told ABC radio's AM program.
After the interview Clarke, who owns the Poole's Rock winery, attended a protest by the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance outside the AGL annual meeting.
Inside the meeting, Clarke did not raise the matter directly with the AGL chairman, Mark Johnson, who was his deputy on the Macquarie board until 2007. But it seems relations have been sour for some time between the pair who both started at Macquarie (then Hill Samuel) in 1971.
 The answers I got back I regarded as insulting to my intelligence,  Clarke said about an emailed reply he got last year, after discussing the issue over lunch with Johnson and AGL's chief executive, Michael Fraser.
In an attempt to ease worries, Johnson told the meeting:  Since 1837 we have been selling lethal products. We sell products that can kill people - gas and electricity. And we don't kill people. 
HUMAN HEADLINE
Meanwhile, the Hunter Valley-based anti-coalmine campaigner David Paradice has joined the pantheon of fund management immortals, after being inducted into the Australian Fund Manager Hall of Fame last night.

Paradice's firm also beat off the finalists Eley Griffiths, Investors Mutual and Perpetual to take out the Small Companies Fund Manager award. It was the biggest win for Paradice since the expansion of the Bickham coalmine - near his property in Scone - was blocked by the NSW government in May.
Ausbil Dexia's Paul Xiradis took out the human headline award for the fund manager to get the most mentions in The Australian.
The Fixed Interest Award went to Perennial. AMP Capital Investors fended off fellow finalists Maxim Asset Management, Resolution Capital and Perennial to score the gong for Listed Property Fund Manager.
GENUINE DELIGHT
The Australia Post boss, Ahmed Fahour, made a break from tradition on Tuesday by making an appearance at a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra.
Fahour, who failed to appear at a previous estimates hearing in May when he chose instead to attend the International Postal Corporation board meeting in San Francisco, had a hard time convincing senators on his delight at being in Parliament House.  Chairman and senators, it is absolutely a pleasure to be here today,  he said in his opening statement to the hearing.
The Labor senator Stephen Conroy reminded Fahour about his obligations.  Misleading the Senate early on, in your opening sentence, is not good,  he quipped.
Fahour has also copped a bit of flak from the other side of the chamber for his no-shows.
 It just seems astounding that the new managing director is so well briefed as to be able to meet with all the other stakeholders of Australia Post, yet he is not briefed enough to meet with the Australian Parliament today,  said the Liberal senator Eric Abetz at a February hearing.
Fahour's predecessor, Graeme John, was unable to attend the estimates committee in his 16 years at the postal group.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Oil and gas producer Santos says it remains in talks with a number of Asian customers interested in the company's Gladstone liquefied natural gas project, as it sweats on project approval from Environment Minister Tony Burke today.
Santos said in its September quarterly report, released yesterday, that it was continuing discussions with Asian buyers interested in both LNG offtake and equity stakes in GLNG.
 Mr Burke, meanwhile, is set to announce his decision on GLNG and BG Group's rival Queensland Curtis LNG project today. The minister has maintained his timetable on the coal seam gas projects despite the detection this week of cancer-causing chemicals in water at some nearby exploration wells belonging to Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips.
Before the revelation, Mr Burke had been tipped to approve the Santos and BG projects, with strict water-monitoring conditions attached.
Santos recorded an 8 per cent fall in revenues to $535 million in the September quarter, on the back of lower average oil prices and continued flooding issues at its Cooper Basin operations.
The revenue slide came despite a 9Â per cent increase in production to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent and a 3 per cent increase in sales volumes to 15.4 million barrels.
Santos said all its Cooper Basin drilling rigs were back in operation, even though the floods and wet weather had affected activities. The production and revenue figures were broadly in line with analysts' expectations.
Santos said design modifications at its 35 per cent-owned Kipper project in Bass Strait meant it was not expected to be in production until the first half of 2012. The project is operated by ExxonMobil.
Santos maintained its full-year production guidance of 49 million to 52 million barrels of oil.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"As Santos awaits today's decision from the Environment Minister on the fate of its Gladstone liquefied natural gas project, investors are focused on the timing of its potential $2 billion equity raising.
Most investors expect Santos to launch a raising soon after reaching a final investment decision (FID) on the first of its two trains. The environmental approvals â€“ and the tip is Tony Burke is likely to grant approval with conditions today â€“ and a deal with Korea Gas will need to be done before that final decision.
 But the new theory being floated is that chief David Knox and his team are considering holding off on an equity raising until the final investment decision on the second train. That decision is expected 12 months after the FID on the first train â€“ due out by the end of this year.
Goldman Sachs analyst Aiden Bradley reckons that Santos's weak share price and the fact the equity is for the second train anyway may well prompt the company to hold off on a raising until the risk around that project is lower.
On Goldman Sachs estimates, Santos will need between $600 million and $1 billion of equity post the hybrid issue.
Market chatter suggests the company is more likely to raise after FID on the first train, and that project milestones rather than the share price will be the bigger factor in a decision around timing.
Santos is yet to appoint advisers for a potential equity raising but it's worth noting JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup did the job last time. No doubt UBS, which won plaudits for structuring the hybrid issue as 100 per cent equity, will be another likely contender.
But first Santos must gain the necessary approvals and sign its deal with Kogas. The total project cost for the second train is $11.5 billion, and French energy giant Total has already forked out $860 million for a 20 per cent stake. Kogas is in negotiations to take a 10 per cent stake as well as provide a long-term commitment to buy LNG from the project.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"GAS BRISBANE, Oct 23 AAP - The state opposition says it supports the approval of the coal seam gas projects but with the proviso that Queensland's prime agricultural land and underground water must be protected.
Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke on Friday said his department had given conditional environmental approvals for Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas - a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total - and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG.
 They will be Australia's first multi-billion dollar coal seam gas projects.
Liberal National Party (LNP) leader John-Paul Langbroek said that while his party welcomed the green light for the central Queensland projects, it was now up to the federal and state governments to ensure there were no adverse impacts on farming and water in the region.
 The Santos natural gas project and British Gas Curtis LNG project are worth $30 billion and will be the most significant new energy development in Queensland's history,  Mr Langbroek said.
 However, the onus will be on this state government to ensure that all of the operating conditions are met by the industry to protect the communities, the farming land and water.
 There must be constant monitoring to ensure risks are contained and that no problem slips by unnoticed.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Queensland Resources Council says federal approval of two giant coal seam gas projects in Queensland will create more than 12,000 jobs and generate billions of dollars.
The BG Group and a consortium involving Santos, Petronas and Total will capture and pipe coal seam gas from the Surat and Bowen Basins to Gladstone in central Queensland.
 Michael Roche from the Resources Council says it is a massive announcement.
 These two projects will see Queensland become a serious global player in the export of LNG to our energy hungry Asian pacific neighbours,  he said.
 These projects together will be pumping out more LNG than the Gorgon Project in Western Australia so this is pretty big news for Queensland. 
Australia's largest domestic gas producer, Santos, says it has to meet tough environmental and community conditions to extract the gas.
Santos spokesman James Purtill says the approval process has taken three years.
 While the project has a large number of conditions placed on it we are very confident that we can meet and exceed those conditions and the conditions of both the commonwealth and the state,  he said.
Mr Purtill says Santos wants to work with the community and governments to create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars for the economy.
 It has take over three years so we are very excited to get to this point that's for sure,  he said.
 The project has undergone a pretty thorough environmental approval and community consultation process, I would say it was one of the most comprehensive in Australian history. 
Meanwhile, Queensland Coal Seam Gas director Ross Dunn says if the projects proceed as planned Australia will become one of the world's leading suppliers of Liquefied Natural Gas.
 Australia is about the sixth largest producer of liquid natural gas around the world and when these projects come on stream and together with the Gorgon Project in Western Australia, that will take us to about the second largest in the world,  he said.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"ASHLEY HALL: The coal seam gas industry is a step closer to its goal of becoming a major energy player with the Federal Government's approval of $15 billion in gas projects in Queensland.
In a world first, the coal seam gas would be piped from rural areas for conversion to liquid gas.
 But while the industry is spruiking a cleaner energy source and a multi-billion-dollar boost to the economy, the news has brought tears to at least one man living close to the rural gas fields.
Annie Guest reports.
ANNIE GUEST: The coal seam gas industry is banking on huge eastern Australian reserves, and a more coal-averse, carbon-conscious future to help it become a significant energy player.
The Federal Government's conditional approval of two central Queensland plants to compress gas taken from rural coal seams into liquid - a world first - marks a coming of age, according to the Premier Anna Bligh.
ANNA BLIGH: This is a turning point for the Queensland economy. We will look back on this day as the day a whole new industry started.
ANNIE GUEST: First there's 300 conditions to be met and money to be raised by the Santos-led consortium and BG Group's Queensland Gas Company, skills shortages to be overcome and pipelines and plants to be built before the first shipment is expected in 2014.
Before then, other companies are also hoping to gain approvals for similar plants around Gladstone in Central Queensland, including a ConocoPhillips - Origin Energy partnership and Shell Australia.
The numbers are impressive - potentially more than 10,000 jobs and BG Group alone expects to increase Queensland's gross state product by up to $30 billion in the first decade.
The Queensland Resources Council's Michael Roche says the coal seam industry will be bigger than Western Australia's conventional Gorgon gas fields in five years.
MICHAEL ROCHE: Queenslanders are really leading the way when it comes to exporting coal seam gas so I think the rest of the world is really watching how we pull this off.
ANNIE GUEST: The gas will be extracted from coal seams through thousands of wells drilled in central and southern country Queensland.
Many in rural areas welcome the economic and population boost.
But others don't, and these approvals follow protests against the industry in New South Wales. And in Queensland this week, traces of cancer causing chemicals detected in other company's drilling wells.
One of the Government's approval conditions involves ensuring drilling wells in the water-intensive process are not porous.
But that doesn't pacify Brian Monk who fears his property will one day be covered in wells.
BRIAN MONK: It' decimating lives out here. It shatters what should be idyllic, really... (begins to get upset). Sorry, God, I've become a bigger sook as I've got older, you know?
ANNIE GUEST: This makes you very sad.
BRIAN MONK: Mmm, yeah. Well, the family gets decimated effectively, and my son and daughter-in-law leave here with virtually nothing. Your land's worth nothing, literally. You cannot sell a property in this region.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND
ENVIRONMENT Minister Tony Burke has give the green light to two controversial coal-seam gas projects in Queensland worth $30 billion.
 Mr Burke's decision came with 300 environmental conditions for each, including planned testing of the underground water supplies relied on by farmers.
The coal-seam projects approved by Mr Burke are a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total â€” known as the Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project â€” and British Gas Group's Queensland Curtis LNG project. Industry groups claim the two projects will create up to 18,000 direct and indirect jobs.
Shipping of gas is expected to begin in 2014.
The projects will also require the drilling of thousands of coal-seam wells in Queensland's Surat and Bowen basins, with the gas piped hundreds of kilometres to Curtis Island for conversion to LNG.
Local farmers have raised concerns about harmful effects the projects will have on the Great Artesian Basin and underground water supplies.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"MINING giants British Gas and Santos were last night examining 300 conditions placed on them by the federal government to decide whether their $30 billion coal seam gas projects will go ahead.
Environment Minister Tony Burke released the approval for the two projects late yesterday but the detailed list of conditions for the industry became available only after the close of business.
 ``I have decided that these projects can go ahead without unacceptable impacts on matters protected under national environmental law,'' Mr Burke said.
Last night, both companies said the documents needed further examination but Santos indicated it should be able to comply.
The federal approval was welcomed by the Queensland government but attacked by environmental groups and farmers, who are concerned about the effect of extracting vast amounts of underground water from aquifers, including those connected to the Great Artesian Basin.
South Australia-based Santos -- in partnership with Malaysia-based Petronas -- and British Gas, which took over the Queensland Gas Company, are both proposing refineries at Gladstone in central Queensland, with an investment of about $15bn each. But there are a further two projects also seeking approvals to extract natural gas from coal seams in the Darling Downs and some from the Bowen Basin, inland from Gladstone.
The conditions limit the number of gas wells to 2650 for Santos and 6000 for British Gas, and restrict the amount of water that can be extracted, which in practice will also limit the amount of gas they can extract.
Groundwater levels within each aquifer must be monitored closely. and the companies will also have to detail which materials they use in ``fraccing'' the coal seams -- a controversial practice that has led the Queensland government to ban certain materials.
The companies must also provide water management plans, including methods to maintain or re-establish pressure in aquifers such as through re-injection of water taken out as part of the coal seam gas extraction process.
Environmental campaigner Drew Hutton said the government was taking a leap of faith that the massive uptake of water -- the equivalent of 110 Olympic-size swimming pools of water from the aquifer each day at the projects' peak -- would not have an impact on the groundwater.
``It's an act of faith, not an act of science,'' he said yesterday.
The Queensland Farmers Federation said the CSG industry was expanding so rapidly it outpaced the science and planning.
The approvals had been due in the first half of this year but were delayed until after the election by Mr Burke's predecessor, Peter Garrett.
The industry is important for Queensland, as it has the potential to provide 18,000 jobs and investment of $40bn along with an increase of $3bn in gross state product and $850m in royalties a year.

WOODSIDE Petroleum is reviewing costs and timing of the $12 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia, where the company has had to start dismantling parts of its 130m-high flare tower because it has not been built to withstand very high winds.
 The review has led analysts to boost cost estimates and delay first production forecasts on the project, which is targeting first LNG production from a plant on the Burrup Peninsula in March next year.
In its third-quarter production report yesterday, Woodside said Pluto was 94 per cent complete at the end of last month.
``A comprehensive periodic cost and schedule evaluation is under way; the results will be available in November,'' the Perth-based oil and gas producer said.
A spokesman said that it was too early to say whether delays or cost overruns were on the cards.
Further worrying analysts, Woodside announced another dry hole, the Camus-1, in its 20-well exploration program, which it has described as the nation's biggest.
Woodside hopes to expand Pluto by adding second and third production trains.
The firm said the flare tower designs were not in compliance with its wind load specifications.
``Some sections of the flare towers are being dismantled in preparation for the approaching cyclone season and corrective action,'' it said.
Contractor Foster Wheeler/Worley Parsons was managing the flare towers through a flare design and fabrication specialist, Woodside said.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee delayed his estimate for first LNG from Pluto until July and boosted his development cost estimate by $200m.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND'S gas rush will start as early as January after two massive liquefied natural gas projects were given the conditional green light by the Federal Government, paving the way for 10,000 jobs and the industrial development of central Queensland.
But while Gladstone business breathed a sigh of relief, question marks still hang over the two projects that will now have more than 900 state and federal environmental conditions each to deal with as well as community suspicion that not enough has been done to cope with the contamination impacts and health concerns.
 The Santos-led GLNG project said it could cope with the stringent conditions imposed on it and a final decision to invest would be made before the end of the year, while Queensland Gas was reviewing the massive pile of conditions but welcomed the decision.
Farmers, environmentalists and Gladstone MP Liz Cunningham raised fears about a lack of infrastructure, poor planning and threats to the environment from the projects.
Farmers said there were still a myriad of scientific risks that remained under debate, while Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters said the projects were too risky.
The schemes will be the first in the world to develop coal seam gas into LNG, and are expected to need a major focus on skilling workers to deal with the demands.
The Federal Government has demanded that the two projects protect groundwater resources in central Queensland and replace any water from depleted aquifers.
They must also secure an area five times the size of their LNG project sites to be added to the national park estate or protected in perpetuity.
The Gladstone Port must also put in place measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef as well as threatened and migratory species including dugongs, turtles and dolphins.
Sustainability Minister Tony Burke said the projects could go ahead without unacceptable impacts.
``While there are significant economic benefits to these projects, which must be a consideration in my decision, my focus has been on protecting environmental matters such as protected species and ecological communities,'' Mr Burke said.
The combined value of the projects is expected to be more than $20 billion and will be completed by 2014 to meet Asian demand for the gas.
Premier Anna Bligh said a whole new export industry was about to become a reality.
``This means jobs for a generation of Queenslanders,'' Ms Bligh said. ``Five years ago this was unthinkable but today, a whole new export industry is set to become a reality.
``The process has taken approximately two years and involved around 27,000 pages being assessed by the Queensland Co-ordinator-General, who has imposed 1200 conditions covering everything from social housing to environment impacts.
``Along with the 300 new conditions imposed as part of the Federal Government's approval, these are some of the most stringent environmental conditions ever imposed on an industry and its projects.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"COAL seam gas was never going to be stopped, no matter what the environmentalists and Surat Basin farmers and residents thought. In the end, the Government was prepared to take the blows that would come from landowners in exchange for money, jobs and the industrialisation of Queensland.
The two LNG plants won't be the end of this story, just another chapter. Following on from this will be the opportunity for more LNG projects, greater industrialisation and a fundamental change in the Queensland economy.
 It is the gas rush to equal the gold rush, but the companies involved need to do a much better job than they have so far. The two projects given the Federal Government's tick yesterday are likely to get board approval in the next few months and from there it will be a flurry of activity.
Billions of dollars have already been borrowed and spent on buying equipment and infrastructure and next will come the jobs - about 10,000 of them for the construction of the plants on Curtis Island, off Gladstone.
There will be problems and justifiable concerns for the environment. Creeks that rarely run will be filled with water, groundwater resources will be affected, farms invaded by drill teams, massive amounts of salt will be packed into landfill and the very nature of some rural communities will change forever while jobs will become a huge issue.
There is no way the projects can be built without overseas labour - and lots of it. On top of that, a massive dredging and reclamation job will be done at Gladstone Harbour to allow the huge LNG ships to use the port.
It could also revitalise the bush and bring new jobs to dying towns as well as reskill a workforce and allow Australia to benefit from the transition from coal to gas to renewable energy.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE coal seam gas industry has not always been a success story.
In the 1970s, attempts to develop it in the Bowen Basin failed. Houston Oil & Minerals drilled two unsuccessful wells and the industry was abandoned.
 For decades CSG was considered a menace in coal mines and it was a factor in the deaths of 36 miners in the three Moura Coal Mine disasters.
Texan owned Tri-Star began exploring in 1989 in an area in central Queensland it considered to be worth $20 billion, and was eventually bought out by Origin.
In 1999, Bob Bryan started Queensland Gas Company, eventually floating the company for $12 million. It was eventually bought by the UK-based BG Group for $5 billion.
But it was not all plain sailing.
BHP walked away from it because of a lack of consistency and the technology and know how was not always up to scratch.
``In one of the holes we'd finished, we couldn't stop the gas,'' Mr Bryan said. ``We had to shut the hole off and we needed something to put down it without it all blowing out of the top. So we tipped an old refrigerator into the hole, then got a load of ready-mix concrete and poured it on top of the refrigerator. We made the mistake of leaving our steel peg and number beside it.''
It was rediscovered 20 years later by a bewildered QGC exploration team.
The CSG fields of Queensland and northern NSW contain enough gas to power a city of 1 million people for 5000 years.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"OCTOBER 22, 2010, will go down as an important day in Queensland's history. It was the day that approval was given for two huge coal seam gas projects, with others certain to follow. What Queensland makes of this date in decades to come remains the major question. Federal minister Tony Burke kickstarted the industry yesterday with his approval of Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas - a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total - and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG. It was the starting gun for an energy boom that is set to deliver tens of billions of dollars of investment over the next 10 to 15 years.
 Tensions remain among farmers, environmentalists and others concerned at the potential side-effects. Tens of thousands of holes will be drilled, with water pumped from the seam to enable gas to come to the surface. The effects that will have on the water table and on the surface are yet to be determined but federal and state governments are satisfied that the risks can be minimised. This could be a huge, flourishing industry that boosts Queensland with investment and thousands of jobs. But that depends on whether the governments and the gas companies have done their homework. Has there been enough planning done for the tens of thousands of workers needed to ensure the projects work at capacity. Were the reports presented to the State Co-Ordinator General done thoroughly and without pressure from the State Government? Did the Government need more time to properly assess the potential impacts of the industry? Aside from that planning, the Government and those in future years must step wisely to ensure the bounty from the gas industry is spent for the benefit of its citizens.
There is reason to be concerned. The state has roared through one of the biggest coal market booms it has known only to emerge with massive debt levels and a lowered credit rating. The Government has claimed it has been dented by a huge spend on the population growth that follows such economic success. The revenues from the gas industry cannot be frittered away by a government that has not impressed with its spending record in key areas. The latest revelations in the Queensland Health payroll debacle almost defy belief. While the state is gathering the revenue, it must keep an eye on the environment to ensure that the state's wondrous natural environments are not ruined in the rush for gas. The Government insists this will not happen, based on that planning and research which led to Tony Burke's decision yesterday. And that is why October 22, 2010, will be an important day in this state's history. In 30 or 40 years, we will look back and discuss whether the gas industry was a winner for this state or a rushed money-grab by a government that did not do the hard work.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"INVESTORS yesterday took a punt Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke would approve two LNG projects in Queensland and pushed Santos and competitor Origin Energy's shares higher.
Mr Burke gave the projects by Santos and BG Group for Curtis Island in Gladstone harbour the nod, subject to conditions largely focused on monitoring of the effects of their coal seam gas production on water quality in the Great Artesian Basin.
 Though his decision didn't come until after the market closed, the general conviction that he would tick off the projects propelled Santos shares up nearly 2 per cent, or 24, to a $12.50 close.
The BG and Santos projects will together cost about $30 billion and launch a major export industry in Queensland that should earn billions of dollars during the next 20 years or so.
BG's shares, quoted in London but not in Australia, were expected to rise overnight while Origin Energy, which is also eventually proposing a Curtis Island LNG plant - but is trailing BG and Santos for lack of customers - also saw its shares advance, by 2.12 per cent, or 33, to $15.92.
Smaller CSG explorers - the likes of Westside Corp, Bow Energy, Blue Energy and Eastern Star Gas - also saw their shares rise although Dart Energy, which has been one of the strongest of the juniors in recent weeks, fell 4 to $1.16.
The minister's decision clears the way for BG and Santos and its partners, Malaysia's Petronas and French group Total, to make final commitments to their LNG developments, both expected to cost about $15 billion, by year's end - a target formally affirmed by Santos yesterday.
But both hope to be producing LNG for export on the island by 2014.
Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood, who like most analysts had predicted that Mr Burke would approve the two proposed developments, said the water-monitoring conditions could add something like $20 million to the costs of a project like Santos's.
But in the scheme of things, given the overall costs of the Santos and BG projects, Mr Greenwood said the amount ``is small relative to total'' capital expenditure.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the approval ``is a significant milestone as it builds towards a final investment decision later this year.''
Final investment decisions (FIDs), with BG also targeting board approval before year's end, will result quick starts on the two developments.
But it may not be completely plain sailing from then on.
Graeme Bethune, a long-time industry observer and chief executive of the Adelaide consulting firm Energy Quest, said yesterday: ``A conventional LNG project is large and complex.
`` An unconventional coal-seam gas project is even more so. Now the hard work begins.''
The approval of eastern Australia's first LNG plants presented an unparalleled economic and environmental opportunity for Queensland and Australia, Australia's peak gas industry body, Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, said.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,4,"THE Federal Government has approved Australia's first multi-billion-dollar coalseam gas projects, angering farmers and environmentalists but promising a major jobs boost for Queensland.
Environment Minister Tony Burke said yesterday his department had given conditional environmental approvals for Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) - a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total - and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG.
 ``I have decided that these projects can go ahead without unacceptable impacts on matters protected under national environmental law,'' said Mr Burke.
However he placed 300 conditions on each of the projects.
``We must protect the Great Artesian Basin, our threatened species, our waterways and the Great Barrier Reef.''
The approvals were delayed earlier this year by Mr Burke's predecessor, Peter Garrett, who was concerned about the projects' potential impact on groundwater and the Great Barrier Reef.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the environmental approval was an important milestone for GLNG before a final investment decision later this year.
``As our EIS submission outlined, we are committed to implementing comprehensive environmental management plans,'' said Mr Knox yesterday.
The $16 billion GLNG project involves 2650 coalseam gas wells being drilled over 25 years in Queensland's Surat and Bowen basins, a 435km steel pipeline from the Fairview gas fields to Gladstone, and an LNG plant and export facility on Curtis Island.
The project is expected to create about 5000 construction jobs, as well as 1000 permanent operational jobs from the start of shipments of LNG in 2014.
QGC Pty Ltd, a BG Group business, received Queensland government approval for the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) project in June. Analysts have put the cost of the project at between $12 billion and $18 billion.
The project involves coalseam gas operations in the Surat Basin, a 540km underground pipeline network and LNG plant on
Curtis Island.
An estimated 5000 jobs will be created during construction with more than 700 during operation.
This week, four toxic chemicals - benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - were discovered in eight wells owned by Australia Pacific LNG in the Surat Basin.
Queensland Farmers Federation CEO Dan Galligan said his members feared the rapid expansion of the gas industry was outpacing the science and planning, especially in terms of its impact on water.
``The country needs these water resources for the long term to produce food, fibre and wealth long after the minerals and gas are extracted,'' he said.
Australian Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters said the number of conditions showed the measure of the risks involved.
She said coalseam gas was no cleaner than coal.
``By the time it gets extracted, transported and liquefied it's 98 per cent as greenhouse gas-intensive as coal,'' she said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Woodside Petroleum has warned it is reviewing the cost and schedule of its $13Â billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project, sparking expectations in the market that it will miss its already deferred start-up target of March by several months.
The results of the  comprehensive  evaluation would be available next month, Woodside said on Friday in its quarterly report.
 Construction of the Pluto project, which is about 94Â per cent complete, was slowed earlier this year by industrial action at the plant site near Karratha.
Problems have arisen more recently with the flare towers at the onshore site, which are not up to the required standards to withstand cyclones and must be partly dismantled.
The Weekend AFR revealed in August that the flare stack at the plant had to be modified because of an inadequate cyclone-proof rating. The region typically has five tropical cyclones each season, but the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting an unusually active season this year with up to seven.
The construction of the flare towers is being managed by the principal engineering contractor, Foster WheelerWorleyParsons.
Woodside has already had to increase the budget once for Pluto â€“ its key growth project â€“ which was originally due to cost $12 billion. In August, it said delays to construction would cost an estimated $32.5Â million a week.
Woodside has been targeting the end of February to start the LNG processing facility and the end of March for first production, but it has warned the timetable was subject to a  productive  industrial relations environment and to the weather.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said yesterday he now expected first LNG production only in July, rather than May. He also increased his assumption of the project capex by $US200 million.
Chief executive Don Voelte has emphasised he has contingency measures in place to ensure Woodside can meet LNG delivery obligations to its two customers, Tokyo Gas and Kansai Electric. These are understood to involve deals to source LNG from rival ventures to on-sell to the Japanese.
Woodside also reported disappointing results on Friday from its latest exploration well targeting gas to underpin a expansion of Pluto, with Camus-1 coming up dry.
The two pieces of negative news overshadowed an otherwise robust quarter for Woodside, whose revenue rose 15 per cent from a year earlier to $US1.033 billion ($1.05 billion), despite an 11 per cent dip in output.  It was a strong quarter, particularly out of the North-West Shelf, but the cost and schedule review at Pluto is flagging the potential for further delays and cost overruns,  said Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood.  That's not a big surprise but it's not great. 
The failure of Camus-1 also puts more pressure on Woodside to succeed with its next exploration wells in the Pluto region, including Moyet-1, Remy-1 and another well in the WA-404-P permit held jointly with US oil firm Hess.
Mr Voelte has already deferred the target date for a final investment decision on the Pluto-2 expansion project into 2011 from late this year, as he extends the exploration hunt and continues talks with third parties, including Hess, on possible gas supply deals.
 They need to reach a certain threshold volume in order to substantiate Pluto-2 going ahead and if they can't meet that with the next few exploration targets, then Pluto-2 will probably be reliant on third-party gas,  Mr Greenwood said.
The company has targeted February to start the LNG processing facility.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Queensland moved a step closer to $35Â billion worth of new investment when federal Environment Minister Tony Burke gave conditional approval to two liquefied natural gas projects on Friday.
Mr Burke cleared the coal seam gas-fed LNG projects headed by Adelaide-based Santos and England's BG Group, provided they adhere to more than 300 conditions, including strict water monitoring.
 While the projects offered substantial economic benefits, Mr Burke said his focus had been on protecting the environment.
BG's Queensland Curtis LNG project would generate $2.6Â billion a year in gross domestic product and 4000 jobs during construction, he said.
The Santos-led Gladstone LNG project would contribute $4.1Â billion a year in GDP and create up to 4300 jobs during development, Mr Burke said.
The decision follows Tuesday's revelation that cancer-causing chemicals had been detected in water at eight coal seam gas exploration wells belonging to Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips.
The detection of the chemicals, which prompted the shutdown of a portion of Origin and Conoco's Queensland exploration efforts, led to renewed calls from landowners and greens groups for a moratorium on the coal seam gas industry.
Mr Burke said there had been no evidence of similar problems at either of the approved projects.
His approval includes strict conditions on monitoring the impact of the fields on the Great Artesian Basin, one of the world's largest sources of ground water.
Queensland's coal seam gas industry will involve thousands of wells extracting up to 420 megalitres a day of mostly brackish ground water, slightly less than the entire average daily water consumption of Brisbane.
The wells work by extracting water from the coal seams, altering the pressure and freeing the gas to flow to the surface.
The approval was the last major regulatory hurdle facing both projects.
BG is expected to approve the estimated $20 billion QCLNG project shortly after it reviews the conditions.
The approval leaves Santos in a position to meet its target of a final decision on its project by the end of the year.
Santos has been waiting to secure an equity stake sale and long-term sales agreement with state-owned Korea Gas, but the deal has stalled while Kogas waits for Korean government approvals. The clearance by Mr Burke could help the Kogas deal to progress.
The Queensland government, which attached 1200 conditions when it gave environmental approval to both projects earlier this year, touts the coal seam gas-to-LNG industry as the next leg of growth in the state's economy.
Premier Anna Bligh said the approval of the projects would create jobs for  a generation of Queenslanders .
 Five years ago this was unthinkable but today, a whole new export industry is set to become a reality,  she said.
"
AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,4,"Santos Ltd says its newly-approved Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project in Queensland will be supplied with gas from its Cooper Basin joint venture with Beach Energy Ltd and Origin Energy Ltd.
Santos on Monday said the deal involved supplying 750 petajoules of gas over 15 years starting from 2014, mainly from Santos' uncontracted 2P reserves in the Cooper Basin straddling South Australia, Queensland and NSW.
 In the energy sector, 2P reserves are defined as having a 50 per cent likelihood of being commercially produced.
The gas supply deal is conditional on Santos and its GLNG joint venture partners, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total, making a final investment decision (FID) on a second processing train at the GLNG project.
Santos said on Friday, when the federal government gave environmental approval for the GLNG project, that it expected to reach a FID on the first train by December, with FID for the second train expected next year.
A single-train development was expected to cost $7.7 billion but analysts have put a $15 billion price tag on a two-train project.
Santos said the price under the gas supply deal would be linked to crude oil prices.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the agreement opened an export channel for Cooper Basin gas and accelerating its monetisation.
 The oil-linked pricing will underwrite future investment in the Cooper Basin and unlock the potential of the Basin's remaining substantial resources,  Mr Knox said in a statement.
 For some time, Santos and our partners in the Cooper Basin have highlighted the enormous potential of infill drilling and unconventional gas if a sufficiently attractive price could be established.
 This deal achieves that. 
Beach Energy Ltd, which holds a 20.21 per cent stake in the Cooper Basin joint venture, said in a separate statement that talks with Santos were incomplete and the terms of any potential agreement remained subject to ongoing discussions between all involved parties.
A spokesman for Beach said the deal still required the completion of relevant documents.
Beach managing director Reg Nelson said he welcomed the initiative and the prospect of enhancing opportunities in the basin.
Beach said supplying the GLNG project would optimise Cooper Basin infrastructure and likely stimulate longer-term investment in the hydrocarbon-rich area.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The independent Member for Gladstone, Liz Cunningham, says the Queensland Government must upgrade the city's hospital ahead of an influx of workers to the state's central region.
On Friday, the Federal Government gave conditional approval to two multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
 The projects would see the coal seam gas extracted from the Surat Basin and piped to Gladstone in the state's central region for processing and export.
Ms Cunningham says affordable housing, rental assistance for families and health services must be put high on the State Government's agenda.
 Work to be done at the hospital - there's been a lot of talk over the years and I've had productive talks with Health Minister [Paul Lucas] in the last month,  she said.
 But those talks have to be translated into action now to bring the hospital up to a standard to support such an increase in the community. 
She says while there are many benefits to expansion, growth has to be sustainable.
 Now that the announcement's been made, I don't believe the Government has any excuse not to invest in more housing,  she said.
 There's got to be more money invested in affordable housing, support for families that are here in rental properties where the rents will go through the roof and they'll have to find alternate accommodation. 
Meanwhile, Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown says the Federal Government and two energy companies will have to be held to account over planned coal seam gas projects in the Surat Basin.
Councillor Brown says producers are concerned about the environmental impact but businesses are pleased about the economic opportunities.
 We want to minimise the impact which is the minimum amount of negatives we can get and obviously push towards the positive side because it does create enormous wealth across the region,  he said.
 Just now we've got to make sure the state and federal governments actually put some infrastructure out here where the impact is. 
Cr Brown says the projects will create growth but that will have to be managed.
 I think we've got probably some exciting times ahead of us, both making sure we keep these companies transparent and accountable for their actions and obviously the growth factor's going to be an enormous challenge across the region,  he said.
 I do hope we've planned fairly well for what's going to occur.

The Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke says he has imposed 300 conditions Santos and BG Group's plans to process gas from the Surat Basin in the state's southern inland.
 Agforce Grains president Wayne Newton says while they are happy with the conditions, they are worried the Queensland Water Commission does not have enough experience to be involved in rural projects.
 That body has been responsible for looking after the water supplies in South-East Queensland which are mainly surface based,  he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The International Energy Agency has cast doubts over the ambitions of the Australian liquefied natural gas industry to topple Qatar as the world's largest producer.
At least a dozen local LNG projects worth more than $220 billion are under construction or slated for development over the next decade.
 Speaking exclusively to The Â­Australian Financial Review, IEA deputy director Richard Jones said some of the proposed projects would fall by the wayside.
 If you add them all up, you get more than 100 million tonnes of annual capacity. Obviously the Chevron Gorgon project and . . . Woodside's Pluto project will get up, but they only cover a quarter of all the proposed capacity. Among the rest of the LNG schemes, I think you can expect some serious consolidation. Not all will proceed. 
Australia's proposed projects could result in the country overÂ­taking Qatar as the largest LNG exporter in the world. The projects would lift output fourfold to 100 million tonnes a year by 2020.
Currently the small Middle East state is easily the largest producer in the world with capacity of 77 million tonnes of LNG a year, four times that of Australia.
Mr Jones said with so many LNG schemes competing in Australia, not all would survive.
 With Qatar you're competing against a well-organised state-run company with large gas supplies whereas in Australia there will be tremendous competition among these plants to even find the actual gas to liquefy,  he said.
 That means they have to get into line, and for that reason you will certainly see some consolidation in the Australian industry over this coming decade. 
Australian companies including Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy are involved in rival LNG schemes on the east and west coasts; international energy majors including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group are also poised for significant investment in Australia's LNG sector.
However, the imposition by the federal government on Friday of strict new environmental conditions on the fledgling Queensland coal seam gas sector and more delays in Woodside's flagship Pluto LNG project near Karratha have raised fresh concerns about the speed at which the industry is moving.
 You will always get small delays and of course the regulatory process is important as well for Australia. But I think the fundamentals for LNG remain good,  Mr Jones said.
The IEA said strong growth from the Chinese economy and continued demand from Korea, Taiwan, Japan and India were a positive for the local LNG industry.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips' $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project in Queensland should be ready for an investment decision by the end of the year despite last week's chemical scare, says Origin general manager of upstream oil and gas Paul Zealand.
Mr Zealand said the approval on Friday of the rival LNG projects of Santos and BG Group by federal Environment Minister Tony Burke would provide a template to expedite APLNG through the approval process.
  It's very helpful that what is now required is now out there in the open, and when we're able to present our project for approval I'm expecting that will be a relatively straightforward process because the government and ourselves now know what's expected of us,  Mr Zealand said.
Origin last Tuesday announced that trace levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as BTEX had been detected in eight exploration wells at the project. The findings reinvigorated calls from environmental groups for a moratorium on the industry, but Mr Burke maintained his schedule on the Santos and BG approvals.
Mr Zealand said APLNG would be unhindered by the BTEX issue: the 17 wells shut down as a result of the scare are not material to the broader project.
While analysts are factoring in delays to APLNG's development due to the project's inability so far to secure long-term customers, Mr Zealand said the project would be ready at ground level for a decision by the end of the year.
 When we're able to tell you something definitive about customers we will, but clearly there's a huge amount of activity going on right now and the whole project is working .â€Š.â€Š. to be ready to take a final investment decision by the end of the year,  he said.
 When the board actually makes its final investment decision can depend on a number of things, but we are procuring long lead items and this project has got momentum behind it.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"MINING SYDNEY, Oct 26 AAP - The NSW Farmers' Association is calling for a moratorium on any new mining or coal seam gas development across NSW because of environmental concerns.

The association has called on the state Labor government and the opposition to support a moratorium and develop a strategic plan that would consider a transparent approvals process, independent monitoring of projects and aquifer protection.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"MINING SYDNEY, Oct 26 AAP - NSW Opposition industry spokesman Duncan Gay says the coalition won't rule out agreeing to support farmer calls for a moratorium on new mining or coal seam gas development across the state.
The NSW Farmers' Association on Tuesday called for a moratorium on these activities due to environmental concerns, particularly the risk posed to farmland and water resources.
 The association's executive council voted unanimously in support of the moratorium at a meeting in Sydney on Tuesday.
Speaking outside the meeting, Mr Gay said he had been presented with the framework for the moratorium last week in Parliament House by Farmers' Association mining taskforce chair Fiona Simson.
 We're not ruling it out, but we've only just had a look at it last week,  he said of the proposed moratorium.
 Parts of our policy hang off this moratorium and were things that we actually developed, so obviously we're going to agree with those. 
Mr Gay's shadow portfolio includes primary industries, energy, mineral resources and fisheries and he is also the NSW leader of the Nationals and deputy opposition leader in the upper house.
Mrs Simson said NSW had experienced a recent boom in coal seam gas exploration, which had left the state dealing with copious amounts of useless water.
The water leftover from exploration activities was unsafe  even after treatment , she said in a presentation.
 The problems with coal mining are pretty obvious and we've seen that in the Hunter (Valley),  she said.
 We have encroachment, the legislation is very outdated, there are environmental problems and we've seen a lot of that in the Hunter with the health testing etcetera. 
One of the main problems with the resource is that the gas is trapped within the coal seam by the pressure of water.
 To release the coal seam gas, you have to release the water,  said Mrs Simson.
 This is not good quality water, it's out of a coal seam and coal seam water is always to some extent saline and has another cocktail of other metals and different arsenics in there as well.
 Even if you treat the water, you're still left with certain amounts of solids and we're talking gigalitres and gigalitres of water,  she added.
The farmer's association wants the state Labor government and the opposition to support a moratorium and also develop a strategic plan that would consider a transparent approvals process, independent monitoring of projects and aquifer protection.
It also wants strict parameters imposed on so-called  sleeper  mining licences, which can see mining activities revived after many decades.
Mineral and petroleum titles and applications cover about 70 per cent of the state and there is a need to make sure that people's property rights are respected, she added.

SYDNEY, Oct 26 AAP - NSW miners have attacked farmers calling for a moratorium on new mining and coal seam gas developments in the state, saying it would threaten $13 billion in new investment.
 The NSW Farmers' Association on Tuesday demanded the moratorium, citing environmental concerns, particularly risks posed to farmland and water.
But the NSW Minerals Council, representing the state's $23 billion mining industry, said such a move would be irresponsible, ill-informed and do untold damage to the state's economy and towns.
 They're advocating the use of a sledgehammer to crack a walnut,  said the council's deputy chief executive, Sue-Ern Tan.
The farmers' association wants the NSW Labor government and opposition to support a moratorium so a strategic plan can be developed for the lucrative coal and coal seam gas industries.
It wants a plan to address a transparent approvals process, independent monitoring of the mining and gas industries and aquifer protection.
 These industries are being allowed to flourish without proper concern for the threat they pose to farmland and water resources,  Fiona Simson, chairwoman of the association's mining taskforce, said in a statement.

The association's executive council voted unanimously in favour of a moratorium at a meeting in Sydney on Tuesday.
The NSW government did not directly address the moratorium issue on Tuesday, but Planning and Lands Minister Tony Kelly's office said it recognised the importance of mining to the state.
 Investment in new mining proposals in NSW is always balanced with environmental considerations,  a spokesperson told AAP.
About $13 billion in investments is proposed over the next 10 years, including more than 50 projects or extensions.
NSW opposition industry spokesman Duncan Gay said he saw the farmers' framework for the moratorium last week.
 We're not ruling it out, but we've only just had a look at it last week,  he said outside the association's Sydney meeting.
 Parts of our policy hang off this moratorium and were things that we actually developed, so obviously we're going to agree with those. 
Any moratorium could apply to new minerals, which includes coal, and gas applications, renewals or extensions.
The coal mining sector alone employs about 13,500 people and more jobs depend on related industries.
Coal is a leading source of state revenue and the NSW city of Newcastle is home to Australia's biggest coal shipping port.
The coal seam gas industry is expanding rapidly in NSW but remains smaller than its Queensland counterpart.
Companies such as AGL Energy are exploring for coal seam gas in the Hunter Valley, best known for wine growing.
But the farmers' association also wants strict limits on  sleeper  mining licences, under which mining can be revived after decades.
Mineral and petroleum titles and applications cover about 70 per cent of the state and there is a need to ensure people's property rights are respected, Mrs Simson said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"ENVESTRA MELBOURNE, Oct 26 AAP - Envestra Ltd has moved to acquire a gas networks business from a NSW state-owned corporation for $108.6 million.
Envestra, the largest distributor of natural gas in Australia, said the acquisition of Gas Networks would be a strong strategic fit for its business model.
 The price includes an enterprise value of $107 million plus a $1.6 million payment for unbilled debtors, the company says.
Gas Networks is currently owned by Country Energy, a NSW state-owned corporation.
The gas network bought by Envestra includes 1,160 kilometres of gas distribution pipelines and 65 kilometres of transmission pipelines in southern NSW.
Envestra's full year revenue in 2011-12 would be boosted by $14 million by the purchase, the company said.
It said Gas Networks would deliver earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $10 million to $14 million.
Envestra managing director Ian Little said the deal strengthened his company and gave more exposure in a growing regional Australia market.
 While this is a relatively small acquisition, we believe it demonstrates Envestra's prudent approach to growing the company through investments that utilise our core competencies,  he said in a statement on Tuesday.
The transaction is being funded by a mixture of debt and equity, together with funds from Envestra's forthcoming dividend reinvestment plan, and is expected to be completed on Friday.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A conservation group says it is still digesting the 300 conditions imposed by the Federal Government on two liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in central Queensland.
The Government approved the Santos and BG Group LNG projects last week.
 Michael McCabe from the Capricorn Conservation Council says the two multi-billion dollar projects are among four proposed for the Gladstone region and he is concerned about cumulative impacts.
Mr McCabe says it is too early to say if the Government's conditions go far enough.
 The risks to the environment go right from the extraction of the gas in the first place, the piping of the gas through the undersea at the narrows to Curtis Island, the risks of dredging to bring the ships into the harbour, the long-term impacts on industrial development on Curtis Island,  he said.
 The long-term risks to the environment do not warrant the 20 or so year horizon for profit making for the gas industry.
 So we're concerned about cumulative impacts if all the proposals go ahead and we've had a history over many decades of conditions being applied to all sorts of industries.
 The difficulty then is enforcing those conditions either through the inability of agencies to enforce them or sometimes political unwillingness to hinder economic development.

The projects received state approval earlier this year, and after months of delay Environment Minister Tony Burke gave the go-ahead for the multi-billion-dollar projects last Friday.
In Senate Question Time today, Senator Brown asked the Government if the timing was an attempt to avoid public scrutiny on a contentious issue.

 Minister Burke added another 300 conditions to the approval on top of the state's 1200.
Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown welcomed the additional guidelines.
â€œIt acknowledges that the State Government and the Federal Government have listened to our communities' concerns,â€? Cr Brown said.
He believes the challenge for council now will be to monitor the companies to ensure they are compliant with the regulations.
â€œIf they've ticked all those boxes, now the main aim is to make them comply with them so all your other issues are addressed.â€?
But Basin Sustainability Alliance Chair Ian Hayllor was disappointed that Minister Burke didn't delay his final decision following reports of leaking gas wells near Condamine and traces of BTEX in exploration wells near Miles last week.
â€œJust how thorough is the EIS process being used to garner Burke's approval when you've got two very serious issues like this which still unresolved?
â€œIf the research that's gone into the EIS process was as thorough as it should be in the many, many thousand page report neither of those incidents should've happened.
â€œThe fact that Tony Burke has put another 300 conditions on top of the conditions from the Co-ordinator General would indicate that there are still so many issues that why on earth you would go ahead until the vast majority of these have already been met?

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"SANTOS has agreed to export $4.5 billion worth of Cooper Basin gas through its planned Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas plant at a price 50 per cent higher than it gets selling it domestically.
The Adelaide-based oil and gas producer said that, from 2014, it planned to deliver 750 petajoules of gas over 15 years to the $15bn-plus GLNG project planned for Gladstone's Curtis Island, with uncontracted conventional gas reserves the primary source.
 As part of an agreement made last month to bring France's Total into GLNG, Santos secured the right to sell gas into the project from its non-coal-seam gas eastern Australian portfolio, outside the GLNG project.
Santos chief executive David Knox said yesterday's deal provided an export market for Cooper Basin gas, both conventional and the shale gas the company believes can be unlocked from the onshore gasfields that straddle the South Australia-Queensland border.
``For some time, Santos and our partners in the Cooper Basin have highlighted the enormous potential of infill drilling and unconventional gas if a sufficiently attractive price could be established,'' Mr Knox said.
``This deal achieves that.''
The deal is conditional on approval of a second train (gas production plant) at Gladstone, for which the Santos-Petronas-Total joint venture is targeting a 2011 final investment decision.
A decision on the first train is due this year.
Mr Knox has said previously that the ``unconventional'' shale and Cooper Basin gas that is difficult to extract, could be profitable if domestic gas prices rose to about $6 per gigajoule, up from the $4 per gigajoule Santos currently receives.
The price in the deal is linked to oil prices, but at $6 per gigajoule would represent $4.5bn of revenue over the 15 years.
It would make up about a quarter of the gas required for the first train at Gladstone and more than 50 per cent of the Cooper Basin's current annual production.
Mr Knox said using the Cooper Basin gas would assist GLNG in ramping up gas levels to the huge amounts needed to start an LNG plant.
The gas is 66.6 per cent-owned by Santos, with Beach Energy owning 20.2 per cent and Origin Energy 13.2 per cent.
Origin chief Grant King said yesterday that although he was in favour of producing the gas from Origin's portion, where it would end up had not been decided.
In a report to a conference yesterday, Mr King confirmed a report in The Australian that said Queensland government approval of the Australia-Pacific LNG plant it was planning with ConocoPhillips was imminent.
He said Bligh government approval was expected as early as this week, with federal approvals were likely to follow quickly.
A final investment decision target of this year is dependent on APLNG signing offtake agreements.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"SANTOS yesterday removed worries that it might not have enough coal seam gas reserves to service its planned Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project by committing conventional gas out of the Cooper Basin to the venture.
However the traditional gas will not replace CSG as the major feedstock for the planned $15 billion Gladstone plant.
 Santos said it would pump 750 petajoules of gas out of the Cooper Basin, in South Australia and western Queensland, to GLNG over 15 years.
And that commitment will both smooth the ramp-up of the GLNG plant, planned for Curtis Island, and provide a significant boost to the financial viability of Cooper Basin gas.
The deal exposes at least a proportion of Cooper output to international prices, which are oil linked and far higher than Australian domestic prices.
``The oil-linked pricing will underwrite future investment in the Cooper Basin and unlock the potential of the Basin's remaining substantial resources,'' Santos boss David Knox said.
Santos' shares jumped 2.5 per cent to $12.82 yesterday while shares in Beach Energy, its partner in the Cooper Basin, climbed 7.4 per cent to 65.5c. But it was smaller CSG players, which investors presumably decided may also be able to key into the ramp-up gas market, which jumped even higher. Both Eastern Star Gas and Blue Energy, for instance, were up more than 4 per cent.
Shares in Origin Energy, another LNG plant hopeful, rose more than 2 per cent to $16.26.
Origin chief executive Grant King said that visits last week to London and Qatar have reinforced his confidence that its Australia Pacific LNG project will find customers.
``In the London market I think most investors are quite bullish about the prospects for LNG and are certainly encouraging us to be patient,'' he said.
Origin and joint venture partner ConocoPhillips expect government environmental approval for APLNG by December.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Santos plans to send up to $US4Â billion worth of natural gas from its eastern Australian assets to its Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project in Queensland to support the potential development of a second processing facility.
The announcement is expected to ease investors' concerns about a potential shortfall of gas for a second LNG train at the estimated $16Â billion coal-seam gas project. It will also earmark Cooper Basin gas for export for the first time and potentially unlock the basin's unconventional gas resources.
 Santos intends to supply 750Â petajoules of gas from 2014 to the GLNG project, a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and Total of France. The gas will be supplied over 15 years under an oil-linked pricing structure with the primary source coming from uncontracted proven and probable reserves from the Cooper Basin.
It represents about 12Â per cent of the gas required under the proposed two-train, 7.2Â million tonnes-a-year project. Santos chief executive David Knox said the agreement would enable the project  to execute the most capital efficient ramp-up of gas supply for trains one and two .
Santos has a 66.6Â per cent stake in the Cooper Basin joint venture, which represents about 499Â petajoules based on the 750-petajoule agreement.
While Santos is committed to supplying the full amount from its eastern Australia assets, it is in talks with its joint venture partners, Beach Energy â€“ which has a 20.21Â per cent stake â€“ and Origin Energy (13.19Â per cent) about their participation in the agreement.
Beach shares rallied 7Â per cent or 4.5Â¢ to 65.5Â¢ yesterday as analysts digested the possible monetisation of its share of uncontracted Cooper Basin reserves.
 This significant additional demand for gas heralds a new era for the Cooper Basin,  Beach managing director Reg Nelson said.  This proposal brings a new large-scale customer with export market opportunities. 
Origin, which is pursuing a rival LNG project in Queensland with US energy giant ConocoPhillips, said that while it supported the further development of the Cooper field as proposed by Santos, further economic evaluation was being undertaken.
The supply agreement is conditional on Santos making a final investment decision for a second LNG train at the GLNG project. A decision on the first processing train is expected by the end of the year, while a decision for train two is expected to follow in 2011.
The agreement comes a few days after Santos received federal environmental approval for the project. The company said yesterday it was committed to meeting the stringent conditions of state and federal government environmental approvals.
Meanwhile, the company is talking with state-owned Korea Gas (Kogas) over an equity stake sale in GLNG and a long-term sales agreement. Kogas confirmed earlier this month it was looking to buy a 15Â per cent stake in the project but is understood to be waiting for the South Korean government to approve the deal.
Santos said it did not expect material capital expenditure before 2014 to deliver the Cooper Basin volumes to GLNG.
KEY POINTS Santos will export gas from Cooper Basin for the first time. The company will supply gas to its GLNG project for its gas processing trains.

SYDNEY, Oct 27 AAP - Calls by farmers for a moratorium on new mining and coal seam gas developments across NSW are unhelpful and may have set back negotiations on a plan for the industry, the state opposition says.
 The NSW Farmers Association wants the state government and opposition to support a moratorium so a strategic plan can be developed for the lucrative coal and coal seam gas industries.
It wants the plan to address a transparent approvals process, independent monitoring of the mining and gas industries and aquifer protection.
The association claims the industry is currently allowed to flourish without adequate environmental safeguards.
NSW opposition industry spokesman Duncan Gay said on Wednesday demands for a moratorium may have set negotiations on a strategic plan back  about another month or two months .
 Certainly my short-term observation is that it hasn't been helpful and we had been getting pretty close to getting things heading in that strategic plan way,  Mr Gay told ABC Radio.
 The moratorium - which doesn't just affect the areas where there is real concern with the farmers, but applies to the whole state - has been seen by the mining side to be unhelpful and certainly from my side trying to bring people together to actually come up with a strategic plan, sadly I think it's taken us backwards. 
When asked if he would back the moratorium, Mr Gay again said:  I'm not ruling it out, nor am I ruling it in. 
The NSW Minerals Council, representing the state's $23 billion mining industry, has said such a moratorium would be irresponsible and ill-informed and would damage the state's economy.
A moratorium would threaten $13 billion in new investment, they said.
NSW Primary Industries Minister Steve Whan said the government would not support a moratorium, and accused Mr Gay of backflipping on the opposition's mining policy.
 The NSW Government has been clear that we do not support a moratorium on mining because our planning practices are stringent and the cost of halting mining would cost the economy billions of dollars on top of tens of thousands of jobs,  Mr Whan said in a statement.
 Duncan Gay is all over the place with one day saying they'll consider a moratorium on mining, then backflipping and starting a war with the farmers.
 It's time that Duncan Gay stops his fence-sitting and comes clean with a policy on coal seam gas mining.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"CLIMATE CANBERRA, Oct 27 AAP - The Australian Greens want all new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants forced to sequester their greenhouse gas, claiming coal and gas projects proposed for Western Australia alone could almost double the state's annual emissions.
Greens senator Scott Ludlam on Wednesday released his calculations of the emissions from new LNG plants and coal power stations proposed for his home state to 2016, as well as two big emitting iron ore projects.
 The figures, sourced mostly from company data provided to the WA government, show the state's annual emissions of around 80 megatonnes would soar to almost double that if all the projects were approved.
The proposed James Price Point hub alone would emit 32 million tonnes a year of greenhouse gases - equivalent to five per cent of Australia's current total greenhouse gas emissions, or New Zealand's entire annual greenhouse gas emissions, Senator Ludlam said.
While Prime Minister Julia Gillard had made a flying visit to praise the sequestration efforts of the giant Gorgon project on Barrow Island, only 40 per cent of emissions would be captured, he said.
 Geo-sequestration has not been proven to be achievable, safe or cost-effective,  he said.
 All new polluting coal and gas projects must not go ahead until carbon capture and storage is proven to be effective and safe and can therefore be made a binding condition on projects going ahead. 
Asked about the possible emissions boom in question time, Senator Penny Wong, representing Climate Change Minister Greg Combet in the Senate, said she wasn't aware of the precise numbers, but agreed to take them on notice.
The government was committed to examining a carbon price to reduce emissions, she said.
 We believe that a carbon price is the most efficient way to ensure that businesses and the whole of the economy takes into account the cost of climate change,  she said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"ORIGIN Executive director finance and strategy Karen Moses said the strong result was a reflection of Origin's deployment of substantial capital and resources during the past couple of years.
It had been particularly focused on the Kupe field in New Zealand, an increased equity interest in the Otway gas project offshore Victoria and continuing growth in production from its coal seam gas fields.
  Australia Pacific LNG's production of coal seam gas increased 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter (June 2010) and achieved peak daily production rates in excess of 300 terajoules per day,  Ms Moses said.
 Driving increased demand was the commencement of supply to Rio Tinto Alumina and commercial operations of Origin's Darling Downs Power Station.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"There is still no word on the results of water quality tests from a coal seam gas project in Queensland's Surat Basin.
The State Government has not revealed who is conducting the independent tests at Australia Pacific LNG's project, west of Miles, in Queensland's southern inland.
 Last week, the Government ordered further independent tests be conducted after traces of a chemical compound were found in eight exploration wells.
Sustainability Minister Kate Jones had said she would have the results by the end of last week.
But her office has confirmed that the tests have not concluded and they cannot give a date on when the results will be ready.
They also could not name the independent laboratory where the tests are being conducted.
In a statement, the Minister's office says the results will be first presented to the company who will then pass it on to the Government and landholders.
Australia Pacific LNG says it has no further comment to make on the matter.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Real Estate Institute of Queensland says the Federal Government's approval of two multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas plants has had an immediate impact on the housing market.
Thousands of workers would be needed for the two projects which would pipe coal seam gas from the Surat Basin to Gladstone for processing and export.
 The institute's Gladstone zone chairman, Mark Spearing, says the effect on the housing market has been across the board.
 We would've had probably four to five hundred per cent increase on enquiry levels and buyer commitments since the announcement's been made,  he said.
 So there's been a real early rush in investors, speculators and your owner-occupier purchasers making a move into the market. 
Mr Spearing says the Government's approval is already pushing prices higher.
 There is simply currently not enough stock on the market to meet the demand,  he said.
 I do anticipate that this early flurry will settle down before Christmas. However, there's still going to be upward pressure on prices in the short-term and certainly throughout the next couple of years.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The New South Wales Planning Minister Tony Kelly has rejected calls for a moratorium on any new mining or coal seam gas projects in the state.
The New South Wales Farmers Association has called for the halt until after a strategic plan is developed.
 Its Vice President Fiona Simpson has told AM that there has been exponential expansion in mining, particularly in the coal seam gas industry.
She says the moratorium is needed.
 We're calling for it because of the concerns that our members have about this rapidly expanding industry and the fact that we don't think that science is keeping up with it and we don't think that legislation is keeping up with it,  she said.
Last week farmers from the Hunter Valley staged a protest in Sydney against coal seam gas development.
Fiona Simpson says there is not enough research on the environmental impacts of the technology.
 Well particularly with an industry such as coal seam gas development, it's a very new industry,  she said.
 In Australia the oldest coal seam gas developments we have are in Queensland and even as recently as last week we are seeing a number of problems with them in terms of water and water contamination.
 We think that we need a whole lot more research and we need a whole lot more science in this before our members can feel confident about this industry. 
However, the State Government says a moratorium would cost hundreds of jobs.
Planning Minister Tony Kelly says any applications are subject to a rigorous approval process.
He is meeting with farmers association representatives today to discuss a sustainable plan for coal mining but says he is not prepared to consider a moratorium.
 It may take us some time to develop this strategy and in that time it would hold back the assessment of the proposals, some of them are in the department's approval process now,  he said.
 (These are) mines that, unless they get approval, hundreds of people will lose their jobs because they're just an expansion of a current mine. 
Deputy CEO of the New South Wales Minerals Council Sue-Ern Tan agrees.
 We think a call for a moratorium on all mining is irresponsible, ill-informed and will do untold damage to the state's economy and regional communities,  she said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"THE nation's coal-seam gas export players, who are planning up to $100 billion of investment in Queensland, are pressing the Gillard government to give greater state royalty concessions as part of the resource rent tax compromise.
The CSG companies, who include global energy giants Shell, BG Group and ConocoPhillips, believe the government resource tax compromise puts their Queensland projects at a competitive disadvantage to offshore operations.
 This is because offshore players do not have to pay any early royalties, regardless of whether royalties are later deducted. Industry sources say the big players want another solution, such as rebates to royalties, to compensate for the early cashflow losses.
The CSG industry also shares the big miners' concerns that the government is reneging on a commitment to credit all state royalties, not just those previously scheduled, as deductions under the new tax system.
As part of Julia Gillard's mineral resources rent tax compromise to Kevin Rudd's mining profits tax, coal-seam gas and other onshore oil and gas projects are to move to the petroleum resource rent tax that now only covers offshore projects.
As with the minerals tax, the government's July 2 compromise stated that under the PRRT, all state royalties for onshore oil and gas operations would be deductible under the tax.
But Ms Gillard and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson now say only previously scheduled royalty increases will be deductible, leading to threats from the miners who negotiated the compromise deal before the last election to walk away.
CSG industry sources said they shared the miners' concerns.
``The detail needs to be worked through to make sure the conceptual positioning (before the election) is reflected in the detail of the royalty agreements,'' said an executive at one of the CSG companies.
``Everybody is going to be concerned about the same issues.''

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"THE state's farmers have called for all new mining and coal seam gas developments in NSW to be suspended until there is a strategic plan which protects food security and agricultural land.
In a move to pressure the state Coalition, which is poised to win government next year, about 80 members of the NSW Farmers' Association's executive meeting in Sydney voted unanimously for a moratorium on all new coal, mineral and gas projects, as well as renewals and extensions of developments.
 A spokeswoman, Fiona Simson, said that the association had held talks with the opposition and NSW Minerals Council for 10 months, but farmland is increasingly being alienated and 70 per cent of the state is now under mineral and petroleum title or application.
 If we continue to talk without taking a strong stand such as a moratorium, we're going to be talking forever,  she said.
 Current legislation is against our water, against our food security and it is against our property rights. 
Mrs Simson said farmers were not anti-mining, but their call drew an angry response from the Minerals Council, which said the association was sharing a policy platform with the Greens.
 It is a disproportionate and extreme response ... It will affect investment decisions, hurt future job prospects in regional areas and make NSW the 'ugly duckling' of Australian states for doing business,  said the deputy chief executive officer, Sue-Ern Tan.
However, Mrs Simson said that landholders were often not notified when their property was subject to a new mineral or gas tenement. They were often shocked when they saw a map revealing mining rights covered their part of the state.
Hunter Valley communities had suffered through  under-handed  government deals done behind closed doors, the farmers' association councillor, Peter Dixon Hughes, said.
In many cases they could not stop miners from coming on to their land, he said.
A blueprint for all future NSW development, which identifies productive agricultural land and water resources needing protection, tops a list of reforms the farmers want before any moratorium is lifted.
A new office of agricultural sustainability and food security, reporting directly to the premier, should oversee independent, peer-reviewed, scientific analyses of the effect mining or gas extraction would have on productive land and water before it is approved, the farmers say.
The state's Water Act should be overhauled to ensure that any interference with aquifers requires specific planning approval, they argue.
They also want  robust, independent monitoring  of any potential impact on air and water quality, and people's health, before exploration and development licences are granted.
Legislation is also needed to ensure landholders affected by mineral and gas extraction are compensated, they say.
Many laws governing mineral and gas extraction are outdated and need significant reform, Mrs Simson said.
The Onshore Petroleum Act  is seriously ill-equipped  to regulate coal seam gas extraction, which can involve carving up farms with access roads, she said.
Ms Tan said that a rigorous planning process means mining proposals are scrutinised for social, environmental and economic impact before they are approved.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Envestra has bought Country Energy's gas networks in NSW, underlining its willingness to pay up for assets that are a good strategic fit as activity in the energy infrastructure space heats up.
The deal, for $107 million including debt plus a $1.6 million payment for gas sales to unbilled debtors, beefs up Australia's biggest natural gas distributor's business in NSW and comes after Envestra has been predicting further consolidation in the energy infrastructure sector.
 Other deals are also expected â€“ Prime Infrastructure is selling its WestNet Infrastructure Group, otherwise known as AET&D. That has a 74.1 per cent stake in WA natural gas distributor WA Gas Networks and a 20.1 per cent stake in Victorian gas distributor Multinet Gas Network.
Australia's biggest private generator, British company International Power, is expected to sell a third of the SEA Gas Underground Pipeline, a $500 million system that transports natural gas from the Otway and Bass basins to South Australia and Victoria. International Power is an equal equity partner in SEA Gas with gas infrastructure business APA Group and the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust.
International Power declined to comment.
The deal is seen as a precursor to the NSW electricity assets privatisation process. The NSW government is selling the Country Energy business, along with other state owned retailers EnergyAustralia and Integral Energy, and a raft of other assets. The Country Energy gas network business wouldn't have been attractive to a buyer of retail, so the government opted to split it out, said Matthew Spence, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
The Country Energy gas networks acquisition is seen as a good fit for Envestra.  It's similar to their existing assets, it's gas distribution, it's all they own, so it's what they know,  said Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Paul Johnston.
But the deal is also thought to be on the expensive side. Merrill Lynch analysts calculate the deal was done at a full-year 2012 enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation multiple of 10.2 times. On the same basis, Envestra is valued at 9.2 times.
 That's not cheap,  Mr Spence said.  So it will depend on what they can say around getting costs out of that business,  he said.
In an interview, Envestra group manager, finance and risk, Paul May said the company would look to strip costs out of the business by removing certain corporate overheads.
An Envestra-owned business close to the Country Energy assets operates at almost half the corporate costs, he said. Envestra would look to extract similar savings from the Country Energy corporate overheads.
Envestra was advised by Core Energy and Gryphon Partners, with Johnson Winter & Slattery on the legal side. Country Energy was advised by Rothschild with Freehills as its legal advisers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Ironbridge Capital has the drill bit between its teeth when it comes to taking advantage of the explosion in coal seam gas activity in Queensland.
As previously reported in Street Talk, the private equity firm is looking to sell Australian Drilling Solutions, now known as Easternwell Group. Macquarie Group has secured the mandate to advise on what will most likely be a trade sale in the first quarter of 2011, although an initial public offering is also being explored.
 Easternwell is forecast to deliver about $70 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the year to June 2011.
The MAC Services Group, the mine-site accommodation business founded by Kevin Maloney in the mid-1990s, was recently bought by Oil States International, a North American company, for $650 million â€“ or a multiple of 10.3 times.
On this basis, it's hoped that Easternwell will command a price tag of about $700 million.
Trade buyers that are likely to kick the tyres include Ensign Energy Services, Canada's second-largest land-based drilling contractor; Nabors (which already has a couple of drilling rigs in Australia), Saxon Energy Services (part-owned by private equity investor First Reserve), Precision Drilling and behemoth Weatherford International, which already has a small presence down under.
Easternwell was formed after Ironbridge completed a deal last Christmas Eve to merge its majority-owned business, Australian Drilling Solutions, which focused on the mining and infrastructure sectors, with Toowoomba-based Easternwell, a provider of oil and gas drilling and integrated services.
Now the number one in its space, there's no doubt last Friday's decision by federal Environment Minister Tony Burke to give conditional approval to two liquefied natural gas projects bodes well for the sale process. Burke cleared the coal seam gas-fed LNG projects headed by Adelaide-based Santos and England's BG Group, provided they adhere to more than 300 conditions.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"A mixed response has greeted the Federal Government's approval of two major coal seam gas projects last week.
Federal minister for sustainability, environment, water, population and communities Tony Burke announced the approval of the Bowen basin based Santos project and QGC's Surat Basin project last Friday.
 Industry groups have praised the decision while farming and environmental organisations have denounced the approval of the plants.
A Queensland Gas Company spokesperson said the Government approval would see them finalise their decision within the year.
â€œThe minister's decisions are the culmination of a rigorous two-and-a-half year environmental and social impact assessment process under Queensland and Commonwealth legislation,â€? he said.
â€œThis process has resulted in consultation with more than 4000 community, rural, conservation and indigenous groups, government agencies and individuals and the production of more than 12,000 pages of scientific analysis and reports.
â€œWe remain committed to considering a final investment decision on the project this year.â€?
Western Downs Regional Council mayor Ray Brown said he was glad to see the environmental restrictions had been placed on the developments.
â€œThe decision opens up enormous development across the region, but the Council is extremely mindful of the compliance measures the Federal government has issued,â€? he said.
â€œThe companies are bound by law now to abide by the conditions of the State and Federal government.
â€œWe've always been supportive of these projects on the proviso that it must be environmentally sustainable.â€?
Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said the project would be a boon for the Queensland economy.
â€œAssuming both projects obtain Board approval, Queensland can look forward to the creation of around 10,000 construction phase jobs and the best part of 2000 operational jobs,' he said.
While the majority of these jobs would be in the Gladstone region where the plants will be located, a number of them will still be located across the Surat Basin.
However, farming and environmental groups have both come out against the decision.
Queensland Farmers Federation chief executive officer Dan Galligan said the go ahead came well before appropriate police had been implemented by State and Federal Governments.
â€œ(Last week's) approval for LNG facilities at Gladstone will see coal seam gas development continue to race ahead in the Surat Basin, while the policy around dealing with the cumulative impacts of these vast projects is plodding along in the background, completely out-paced and out of step with development,â€? he said.
â€œWe are working with the State Government to develop a fair policy for protecting strategic cropping land in Queensland â€“ and we're working to get it done fast. But once again the approvals process and the rapid push for wealth creation is racing ahead of any cautious approach.â€?
Meanwhile Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton has continued their call for a moratorium on the CSG industry.
â€œThe whole thing is a joke,â€? he said.
â€œThe minister has essentially said to the miners that you can go ahead and if things go wrong then you can try and fix them later.
â€œThe whole things is an essentially an exercise in faith.â€?
A number of local alliance groups met yesterday at the Friends of the Earth Warra office to discuss the next step in their attempts to put a stop to the local CSG industry.
Mr Burke said the approval of the plants had come with very strict environmental stipulations.
Approximately 300 conditions have been implemented on gas field, pipeline, plant and shipping activities, which come alongside the 1200 conditions stipulated by the State Government earlier this year.
â€œI have imposed more than 300 strict conditions each on the Santos and Queensland Gas Company coal seam gas projects to help protect groundwater -dependent species and minimise other environmental impacts,â€? he said.
The companies must develop a groundwater monitoring and management plan within six months and develop a plan to mitigate any damage to groundwater aquifers within 18 months.
Mr Burke said the long term future of the land was a major concern in his decision.
â€œI also considered potential impacts on agricultural land and the Great Artesian Basin, among other economic and social matters.
â€œThe companies will have to rehabilitate a significant area of land and conserve other areas in perpetuity.â€?

 However, Richmond Valley mayor Col Sullivan said he would be opposed to a blanket moratorium based on what is happening in Queensland.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Origin Energy hopes to overcome environmental concerns to allow it to recommence fracturing operations on exploration wells at its $35Â billion Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project.
Earlier this month, Origin revealed that routine tests at some wells it owns with ConocoPhillips had detected traces of the cancer-causing agents benzene, toulene, ethylbenzene and xylene (known as BTEX).
 The companies froze work as a result of the scare.
In its quarterly production report released yesterday, Origin said it would recommence fracture stimulation (fraccing) of exploration upon finding a  satisfactory resolution  to environmental concerns.
The exploration wells where BTEX was detected are located in Queensland's Western Downs region, where landowner opposition to the coal seam gas sector has been vocal.
 Australia Pacific LNG is undertaking further comprehensive testing aimed at determining the source of the BTEX,  Origin said in its report.  All waters are contained within lines ponds and there is no indication that licence conditions have been breached. 
Origin has drilled 65 wells, including 12 development wells and 53Â exploration and appraisal wells, with daily production averaging 276Â terajoules a day.
Australia Pacific LNG targets an investment decision by the end of the year despite the chemical scare.
Origin's upstream oil and gas arm produced 37 petajoules of gas equivalent in the quarter to September 30, an increase of 45 per cent from the previous year and 22 per cent higher than the prior quarter. Revenues jumped 52 per cent to $230 million from $151 million for the September quarter in 2009, driven by output from the Kupe gas field in New Zealand and a 20 per cent production boost at Victoria's Otway gas project.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A Hunter Valley farmer believes its now up to the state government to prove it can strike a balance between coal mining and other land users in the region.
Peter Dixon-Hughes, from Denman, is a member of the NSW Farmers executive council that has met with the NSW Planning Minister, Tony Kelly, to demand a moritorium on new mines and coal seam gas development.
 Mr Kelly told the farmers that wasn't possible.
The NSW Minerals Council estimates 50 potential projects are in the pipeline for the state worth about $13 billion and creating 5,000 new jobs, many in the Upper Hunter.
Mr Dixon-Hughes said the government's forthcoming strategic mining plan for the region must address farmer's concerns.
 It is about striking this balance between agriculture and mining and making sure the two co-habitate.  he said.
 Now, there's been a lot of talk but its not resulting in a lot of action and that's where we need to have a bit of a pause and really start doing some regional planning. 
Hunter Valley thoroughbred breeders have backed the farmers call for a moritorium.
John Messara from Arrowfield Stud wants the government to reconsider its rejection of the request.
 I think its a rational approach, we're not saying what ultimately a proper independent view of all this will find, we're saying that we're at a tipping point now,  Mr Messara said.
 We, in the Hunter Valley, particularly with the coal mines and before its too late, let us have a pause, let us look at the competing land uses, let us get some proper independent look at this thing and decide how we go forward. 
The prominent thoroughbred stud owner remains optimistic the state government will act on independent recommendations from the Bickham mine controversy.
In May 2010, the NSW Government banned open cut mining on the property near Murrurundi, north of Scone, because of its potential impacts on local water supplies and horse breeding.
The Planning Assessment Commission (PAC) also found there was strong evidence to ban open coal mining in the Upper Hunter.
Mr Messara wants the government to spell out where it stands on that recommendation.
 It has to some extent slipped off the radar other than dealing with Bickham, the PAC went further than that, they saw this as being symptomatic of other areas in the region,  he said
 There was a very positive response from the Premier and by Mr Kelly, I'm still hopeful that will lead to something like the moritorium that's being called for here. 
Peter Dixon-Hughes said Upper Hunter industries are united on the need for an investigation into the impacts of mining on the region.
 The viticulture and wine people from the Hunter are meeting with Tony Kelly shortly to discuss the same sorts of issues,  he said.
 Its about time that we had this joint force to make sure that we do have a proper assessment done of the cumulative impacts at a regional level.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WOODSIDE chief executive Don Voelte says the company has an oversupply of Asian customers wanting its 50 per cent share of the 12 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas expected yearly from the Browse Basin development in Western Australia.
Speaking at an energy conference in Perth yesterday, Mr Voelte said the price for LNG would remain very strong, despite speculation it may fall as new projects came on line.
 The outgoing Woodside chief said there was strong interest in its share of the $30 billion Browse project.
``When I say we are oversubscribed, we think we are 5.6 to 6 million tonnes, as our equity portion of 11 to 12 million tonnes total,'' he told delegates.
``So we're out-marketing our half of the project.''
Woodside announced in 2007 that it had signed a deal with CPC Corporation Taiwan for 2-3 million tonnes of LNG per annum.
But Mr Voelte said there were several other companies that wanted 2-3 million-tonne portions as well. He would not name the companies, citing confidentiality concerns, but said they came from Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan and another country that he declined to name.
``So overall, we have more interest than we have gas to sell for Browse.''
The three fields being developed by Woodside and its Browse joint venture partners hold 13.3 trillion cubic feet of dry gas and 360 million barrels of condensate. A final investment decision is due by 2012, with a 2017 start-up date likely.
Mr Voelte said LNG prices were ``holding strong''. ``It's not just new long-term contracts. The evidence is also there from the many price negotiations over the last couple of years of existing contracts: the traditional pricing formula of Asia is holding strong.''
He did not expect a flood of LNG supply over the next few years. ``I think you'll see a fairly tight market well into the future.''
Addressing the same conference, West Australian Premier Colin Barnett predicted the state's production of LNG would rise from 20 million tonnes to 60 million tonnes by the end of the decade, as major projects such as Chevron's $43bn Gorgon LNG project were developed.
``Depending what happens around the rest of the world, at that stage we expect to be second to Qatar as a major producer and exporter of LNG,'' he said. He added, though, that it was important local support and supply companies formed alliances to mitigate the likelihood of missing out on contracts for major projects.
Mr Voelte also warned that rising costs and wages could threaten new developments.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"US OIL giant ConocoPhillips aims to make a decision to proceed with its liquefied natural gas joint venture in Queensland at the same time as its rivals.
ConocoPhillips expects the Federal Government to approve Australia Pacific LNG its $35 billion joint venture with Origin Energy in the next month, allowing for a final investment decision, CEO Jim Mulva said this week.
 Santos plans to commit to the first phase of its Gladstone LNG (GLNG) venture by the end of 2010. BG Group intends to ``conclude discussions'' about a decision on its project in 2010, it said this week.
``Over the last year or 18 months, we've really caught up with everyone else,'' Mr Mulva said. ``We essentially are all looking at FID at about the same time.''
All the projects intend to liquefy gas extracted from coal seams for export to Asian markets. Santos recently said that it would use traditional gas from the Cooper basin to also supply the first phase of its project.
ConocoPhillips vice-president of human resources Clayton Reasor said APLNG was in talks with ``several potential LNG buyers'' and planned to make an announcement before the end of the year on ``the sale of two trains of LNG''.
UBS analyst David Leitch, however, said winning state and federal approvals and signing customers in the next 10 weeks would be a ``stretch''.
``Given the quality and quantity of APLNG reserves there is reason to suggest it should proceed ahead of GLNG, but the lack of customer news is the big obstacle for the share price.''
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee recently said ``with APLNG yet to secure a foundation buyer, we believe there is a risk of slippage to the development timeline''.
Origin earlier this month announced that it had found traces of contaminants in eight coal seam gas exploration wells in the Surat Basin.
The amount of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, known as BTEX, that the companies detected in samples was equivalent to a half-cup full in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, Origin said.
``It's really not having an impact with respect to discussions with potential buyers of LNG,'' Mr Mulva said.
Origin shares rose 12 to $25.37 yesterday and Santos's 7c to $12.70.
Mr Leitch said in a recent report on APLNG that the project ``stands in contrast'' to the BG and Santos ventures, which already have customers in place.
Total SA of France last month agreed to acquire 20 per cent of the Santos venture and to buy fuel from the development.

 We plan to have an announcement regarding the sale of two trains of LNG before year-end,  said Conoco's vice president for corporate affairs, Clayton Reasor.
Analysts have previously factored in delays to the schedule for bringing APLNG to market due to the inability of the project to secure long-term customers to date.
Origin said it remained in talks with buyers which  has the potential  to lead to firm off-take agreements and enable a final investment decision to be made on the project.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood said there was a mismatch between the partners' accounts of progress.
  They are talking quite divergent stories,  said Mr Wood.  Origin is talking about having the project 'FID ready' and then pulling the trigger once the customer can be found, whereas Conoco is saying they will have the complete package tied-up by year-end. I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle and we may have a contract or two by December. 
Conoco chief executive Jim Mulva said APLNG expected to receive federal government approval in the next month.
 [In the] last year or 18 months, we've really caught up with everyone else,  he said.  We've made our submissions and we would expect similar approvals here within the next month. Essentially we are working at FID at about the same point in time [as rivals BG Group and Santos]. 
BG and Santos last week received environmental approval from Environment Minister Tony Burke.
Mr Mulva said APLNG's recent chemical scare was not influencing talks with buyers of its LNG from the development. Origin announced that trace levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as BTEX had been detected in eight exploration wells at the project.
 We think we're going to be able to handle this, but it's not having an adverse impact with respect to potential buyers,  said Mr Mulva.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte has shrugged off concerns about flagging Asian demand for new Australian liquefied natural gas projects, pointing to more than ample interest from customers in the $30 billion Browse project.
Woodside has more demand than it has gas available from its Browse project in the far northwest, Mr Voelte said yesterday, adding that rising costs would perversely work in favour of projects such as Pluto and Chevron's Gorgon venture by helping prevent a predicated flood of LNG from swamping key Asian markets.
 Woodside is out marketing up to 6 million tonnes a year of LNG as its share of the Browse project, Mr Voelte said. It already has an initial agreement to sell 2-3 million tonnes a year to Taiwan's CPC, which is being progressed into a sales agreement, he said yesterday after the World Energy Cities Partnership forum in Perth.
 We have another several companies that want 2 million tonne portions, so overall we have more interest than we have gas to sell from Browse.  Mr Voelte would not name the firms but said that Woodside was talking to customers in Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan and  one other country who I can't say because you wi1l know who it is. 
Woodside may reach an initial accord within the next few months to supply LNG from Browse to China, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, citing George J. Gilboy, general manager for the Greater China Region. Mr Gilboy told the wire service that talks were continuing to sell Browse LNG to PetroChina even after a preliminary $45 billion sales accord expired at the end of last year.
But Woodside's partners in the venture, BP, BHP Billiton, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, are understood to have held off marketing their share of Browse gas, awaiting evidence the site on the Kimberley coast controversially selected for the onshore plant will provide for an economic project.
While Mr Voelte has voiced confidence about the economics of Browse, he warned yesterday that rising wage and building costs threatened to delay many prospective Australian LNG projects.
The cost issue  is something government officials, union officials and company officials have to sit down about and kind of take another hard look at this because we do not want to price ourselves out of business,  he said. Mr Voelte singled out the recent stoush between the maritime union and the petroleum industry as a prime example.  I think the maritime union has increased wage settlements by about 35 per cent over the last 12 months and we are not talking about people making $30,000 or $40,000 where you would have a lot more empathy,  he said.
 We are talking about people making several hundred thousand dollars a year getting 35 per cent increases over the next three years. 
Mr Voelte defended recent cost blowouts on Pluto, saying even if the project was further delayed, it would still be a phenomenal result. Woodside warned last week that the schedule and budget for the $13 billion project were under review.
 We are by years still the fastest plant from discovery to getting on,  Mr Voelte said.  You can use any date in 2011 [for first gas] and it is still a phenomenal result. 
But doubt still clouds the prospects for the expansion of Pluto. A much-anticipated gas supply deal between Hess and Woodside to underpin Pluto-2 is still far from certain, with the US explorer telling investors this week it is also considering developing its Carnarvon Basin finds through the North West Shelf venture.
Hess has named Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project and a floating LNG venture with Shell as other options for the 13 discoveries in its WA-390-P permit, although the latter is understood to be only an outside chance. Hess said it would wait until it has completed an appraisal program in the licence, due by mid-2011, before giving a resource estimate and deciding how to commercialise the gas. It originally estimated that the permit, which lies to the west of the Pluto field, could hold between 2 trillion and 15 trillion cubic feet of gas.
KEY POINTS
Woodside is marketing 6 million tonnes of LNG a year as its share of the Browse project.
CEO Don Voelte is confident the Pluto project will still provide a great result, despite cost blowouts.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"Origin on target Oil and gas producer Origin Energy says it remains on track to meet earnings guidance. At the company's annual meeting in Sydney, Origin chairman Kevin McCann reiterated to shareholders that previous targets of underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be 35per cent higher in 2011 than the previous financial year. Origin issued data yesterday showing that the sampling of water bores on properties where it had drilled exploration wells for coal seam gas in Queensland showed no unsafe level of chemicals. Origin shares fell 30c to $15.94.
 Gunns plunges Asset sales and cost-cutting by Gunns weren't enough to appease investors, who sliced more than 7per cent off the woodchipper's share price after it downgraded its 2011 earnings guidance. Gunns cut its 2010-11 earnings before interest and tax guidance by 20per cent yesterday, saying it would now deliver between $40 million and $50million, down from an earlier guidance of $50-60million provided in August.
Investors rushed for the exit door, wiping 5.5c, or 7.53per cent, off Gunns' stock, which finished at 67.5c. The strong Australian dollar and the requirements of its new Tasmanian forest agreement were to blame, Gunns said, adding that 65per cent of this year's earnings would be reported in the second half.
Tatts just the ticket Tatts Group says it's on track to lift earnings significantly in 2010-11 after last year's corporate restructure. Chief executive Dick McIlwain has told shareholders that revenue and profits improved in the first quarter. Mr McIlwain noted analysts were expecting Tatts to deliver underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $650million in 2010-11, a rise of $90million, or 16per cent, on a year earlier. Mr McIlwain said Tatts Pokies was returning to sustainable growth, and NSW Lotteries was being integrated ''comfortably'' into Tatts Lotteries. Tatts' shares fell 3c to $2.50.
Beef over gas One of Queensland's largest beef producers says the coal seam gas industry is the biggest challenge facing the sector and the situation won't be changing any time soon. Australian Country Choice chief executive David Foote said, ''The challenge is sharing our land with mining, or gas explorations.'' The strong Australian dollar was also hurting exports. The Federal Government approved two coal seam gas projects in Queensland last week and about a dozen are awaiting approval.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"ORIGIN'S coal seam gas wells near Miles have been given the all-clear after traces of cancer-causing BTEX chemicals were found in water samples last week.
Its joint venture company, Australia Pacific LNG, said it had told landowners, councils and the State Government that the results of chemical analysis of samples taken from water bores did not identify unsafe levels of any of these chemicals.
 ``Due to the physical separation between the water bores and the fracture-stimulated well, (we are) confident the fracture stimulation operations undertaken on its exploration wells have not had any impact on landholder water bores,'' APLNG said.
State regulators have not raised any issues.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE State Government's plans for valuable farming land could cost the mining industry $1.6 billion a year and lock away $22 billion of investment, according to business.
The Institute for Public Affairs said its $1.6 billion a year cost estimate could be conservative because much of the land to be locked away could include coal seam gas.
 The IPA claimed mining companies were buying farming properties in the Darling Downs at twice the market value to overcome public opposition to planned mining operations.
The Government's planned legislation aimed at protecting the state's best cropping land throws a protective blanket over about 4 per cent of the state, but is so broad that it includes land on which two operating coalmines exist, Crinum and Hail Creek, and the towns of Dalby, Clifton and Monto.
Even canegrowers have expressed their doubts about the planned legislation, particularly because it could tie up land close to urban areas and prevent farmers from selling their land for development.
``The recent cropping land restrictions proposed by the Queensland Government will prevent access to significant coal seam gas reserves in the state and is an example of the anti-mining sentiment in Australia,'' the IPA's report by Julie Novak said.
``Rarely will a mining activity render the associated agricultural land unproductive.
``Even strip mining after remediation, can leave the land little changed in terms of fertility and productivity once mining is completed.''
But the IPA even claimed if land was sanitised by mining over the next 100 years there would still be a net gain to the state because of the compensation paid.
Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche has said there would be a huge cost from the strategic cropping legislation totalling about $22 billion.
``It is a simplistic, populist reaction that will impose a significant sovereign risk on the resources sector and create an unwieldy precedent for future policy on competing land uses,'' he said.
``We believe the government should have faith in its existing environmental impact statement (EIS) assessment process that has evolved through time as a highly sophisticated instrument for making decisions in the public interest.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"OPINION & ANALYSIS
FARMERS don't usually call for moratoriums. This week, though, a meeting of the NSW Farmers Association executive council in Sydney backed plans for a pause on any new mining or coal seam gas development across the state, with more than 70 members of the council offering unanimous support.
 As the chairwoman of the association's mining taskforce, I should explain our reasons for calling for a moratorium, and quell any misinterpretation of our intentions.
The mining industry in NSW is expanding rapidly. So much so that mineral and petroleum titles and applications now cover about 70 per cent of the state. This includes many  sleeper  exploration licences issued under previous regimes that technically should have expired, but can  reappear  and be acted on 20 years down the track.
Legislation historically designed to facilitate mining rather than protect valuable natural resources or landholder property rights is allowing unprecedented expansion of mining and coal seam gas activity on productive agricultural land.
Communities are worried about the effects on their land, their water, and on existing valuable agricultural industries. They're worried vast tracts of land could be sterilised and valuable water resources that have taken generations to form could be depleted or destroyed.
There's no adequate process in NSW governing the granting of exploration licences. There's no adequate process to assess biophysical or natural resource features, current land use and community sustainability.
There's also no adequate process to properly include local communities in meaningful consultation.
In the absence of any such planning controls, the coal seam gas industry has been encouraged to come to the state with the promise of a five-year holiday for any coal seam royalties. The act governing this industry, the Onshore Petroleum Act, is at worst woeful and at best totally inadequate to regulate, control or guide this exciting, yet potentially devastating industry.
In layman's terms, coal seam methane gas is held in the coal seams by the hydrostatic pressure of water. It's always saline and contains a mix of toxic chemicals such as arsenic in varying amounts.
To release the gas, the water needs to be released (brought to the surface and either disposed of or stored), then the gas either escapes or is captured.
The surface effect of the industry is much smaller than open-cut coal mining and offers exciting future opportunities.
But what's going on below the surface when millions of litres of water are released? All that toxic water on top of the ground has already proved to be a major problem for areas in the US and Queensland, where it's still relatively new.
The knowledge surrounding the environmental effects of this industry is sketchy at best. The industry admits it's still a long way from knowing what to do with all that water, how to store it, how to treat it, how to deal with the toxic solids byproduct - and, so far, it's been unable to restore highly productive agricultural land to the same standard it once was.
The long-term effects of this relatively new industry are largely unknown, but are potentially destructive and very alarming. There's a lot more science to do yet and the industry itself accepts it's a long way from knowing all the answers.
Despite all these unknowns, a glance at the publicly available maps showing petroleum titles and applications in NSW shows us the industry has targeted massive areas of the state, full steam ahead.
We're not calling for the mining and coal seam gas industries to be shut down across the state, nor are we suggesting they don't have a place in NSW. But we are suggesting we take a moment to identify the places where these industries can and cannot co-exist with agriculture.
We believe this can happen through statewide strategic planning where valuable natural resources, urban areas for growth, mineral resources and valuable agricultural resources are recognised. We believe this process would remove the uncertainty for all industries and communities, and ensure balance and future sustainability.
Until this form of planning is in place, we believe the sensible and rational thing to do is to take a step back, take a deep breath, and suspend any new mining or coal seam gas developments, until we know what we are doing.
Otherwise, we feel the old adage  act in haste, repent at leisure  could well apply to our future generations.

taskforce.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Woodside Petroleum has taken a decisive step towards ensuring the expansion of its $13 billion-plus Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia by buying out its partner, Hess, from a key exploration permit set to supply gas for the venture.
Woodside said yesterday it agreed to take over Hess's 50 per cent stake in the WA-404-P permit, giving it 100 per cent of the Carnarvon Basin licence that holds the Martell, Noblige, Larsen and Larsen Deep gas discoveries.
 While Hess had already earmarked its share of gas from those fields for Pluto-2, the deal removes the need for any gas supply agreement between the two and gives Woodside total control over how the resources are developed.
Woodside also now has full responsibility for future drilling in the permit, which includes three more wells this quarter, Remy-1, Moyet-1 and another.
No details of the purchase price were released but Woodside said the deal included an initial cash payment at completion, plus further cash payments as certain production milestones are met.
Woodside hasn't said how much gas the fields might hold, although analysts put the resource at 2 trillion to 3 trillion cubic feet, more than half the volume needed for Pluto-2.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said yesterday the deal, likely to be worth less than $US500 million, gives Woodside a stronger negotiating position with third-party gas suppliers for Pluto. The Scarborough field, owned by ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton, was still the most likely provider of gas for the expansion, he said.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte in August pushed out the original target for a final investment decision on the Pluto expansion from the end of 2010 to next year, awaiting either further exploration success or agreements for third-party gas.
Hess still owns 100 per cent of its separate WA-390-P permit, which holds 13 gas discoveries that the US firm is considering developing through a deal with either Woodside's Pluto venture, Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project or the North-West Shelf venture.

BRISBANE, Oct 31 AAP - The huge potential of Australia's liquid natural gas (LNG) resources has received a major boost with the BG Group announcing it will commit $15 billion to develop a LNG project in Brisbane.
 The Queensland's Curtis LNG Project involves building a liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone, a 450km underground pipeline network and expanding production in gas fields in the Surat Basin around Chinchilla in south west Queensland.
The first LNG shipments are scheduled to leave the central Queensland port in 2014.
The project will create an estimated 5,000 jobs during construction and nearly 1,000 when the plant is operating.
Catherine Tanna, executive vice president of BG Group and managing director of its Australian subsidiary QGC, says the project will increase economic activity in Queensland by $32 billion over the project's first decade.
 We also expect to pay about $1 billion a year in federal taxes and a further $300 million or so each year in royalties to the Queensland government,  Ms Tanna said on Sunday.

MT ISA, Qld, Oct 31 AAP - Queensland Premier Anna Bligh says BG Group's announcement that it will export liquified natural gas from central Queensland will mean billions of dollars for the state's economy.
 The company's international board gave the final, formal nod on Saturday night to invest $US15 billion to develop its coal seam gas liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations to export gas from Gladstone.
The investment will go towards expanding existing coal seam gas production in the Surat Basin in southern Queensland and the construction of a 540km underground pipeline network linking the coal seam gas fields to a new two-train LNG plant on Curtis Island.
Ms Bligh said it was the first of several planned projects to get final approval.
 (It) means that this project is now full steam ahead,  she told reporters at Mt Isa on Sunday.
 I understand that they'll be putting new workers on this week. That's how quickly they want to start the construction and getting the project moving.
 So, the last hurdle has been crossed. We now have a Queensland liquid natural gas project.
 It's terrific. 
It's estimated the project will increase Queensland's gross state product by up to $32 billion between 2010 to 2021 and add nearly 10 per cent - around $4 billion a year - to the value of Queensland's annual exports, the federal government says.

Treasurer and acting Prime Minister Wayne Swan said the project would deliver a huge boost to Queensland and Australia.
 It will provide vital support to jobs, to small business, to future investment and it will do that within a framework of environmental protection and the protection of agricultural production,  Mr Swan said.
 It will also bring a very substantial boost to Australian exports. 
Mr Swan said BG's plant would be half the size of the whole of the North West Shelf project and produce a third of Australia's LNG.
 This will be close to the biggest ever investment in a Queensland resource project, probably the biggest,  he said.
 This is a vote of confidence in the attractiveness of Australia as a place to invest and do business. 
Mr Swan said the project would increase inward investment by about 10 per cent per year for the next four years and would boost Queensland's exports by a similar amount.
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said the Gladstone project would prompt a flurry of activity in the LNG industry.

 It committed $15 billion to the project, which includes building a liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone, a 450km underground pipeline network and expanding production in gas fields in the Surat Basin around Chinchilla.
The federal government ticked off the project on October 22 and placed 300 environmental conditions on the development to protect groundwater, the Great Barrier Reef and threatened species.
But Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said the government had allowed the project to go ahead without insisting the company show how it would meet the conditions.
 British Gas has been given periods of time in which they are supposed to present accurate modelling of the Great Artesian Basin and they also have to show how they will minimise risk to our underground water systems,  Mr Hutton said.
 The point is they don't know how to do these yet and so the government is making an act of faith that they will work it out.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"LNG BRISBANE, Nov 1 AAP - The establishment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing and export facilities at Gladstone could have a disastrous impact on threatened marine life, the World Wildlife Fund says.
Endangered species will include Australia's only native dolphin - the rare snubfin dolphin.
  The Gladstone developments will result in mass dredging on a scale never seen before in Queensland - enough to bury a football stadium almost 4km deep in mud and rock,  said Lydia Gibson, WWF-Australia's Marine Species Manager.
 The decimation of feeding and breeding grounds, increased shipping traffic, boat strikes, and chemical and noise pollution could all spell disaster for threatened snubfin dolphins, dugongs, and turtles.
 The scale of dredging proposed is astounding - potentially more than 40 million cubic meters - and it's possible this mud and rock will be dumped inside the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. 
Ms Gibson said there were more than 100 major coastal developments proposed for the Queensland coast, including a number of coal and gas developments proposed for highly sensitive marine areas, including the LNG plant planned for Curtis Island, off Gladstone.
She said a coal terminal planned for Balaclava Island on the mouth of the Fitzroy River 40kms north of Gladstone was proposed in prime snubfin dolphin habitat whre less than 100 snubfin dolphins live.
 The loss of just two or three of these dolphins could be enough to trigger the extinction of this local population,  Ms Gibson said.
Without a strategic approach to managing the impacts on wildlife, it would be death by a thousand cuts for marine turtles, inshore dolphins and dugongs, she said.
 If governments are serious about protecting unique wildlife they must put a stop to the current piece-meal approach to coastal development, adopt a more coordinated approach and designate sanctuaries that protect species from potentially devastating impacts of major coastal developments.

Farmers are extremely worried about the future of rich farming land in the region, particularly soils known as vertisols.
Vertisols have a high clay content, they swell when wet, are subject to compaction and go rock hard when they dry out.
Farmers say the construction of new roads, pipelines and other infrastructure could have a severe impact on their country.
Scientist with the Centre for Mine Rehabilitation at the University of Queensland, Usha Pallai-McGarry, says not a lot of work has been done on the impact of CSG development on these types of soil.
However, she says the vertisols may be difficult to rehabilitate and this could take many years beyond the life of the CSG projects.
 They are highly compactible, so in terms of having pipes laid down, you would have to consider those sort of soils (vertisols) sacrificed for the life of the project.

Earlier tests found reportable levels of the banned BTEX chemicals.
Ian Hayllor from the Basin Sustainability Alliance says he wants to know why the results differ.
 We're really concerned that it was found once at high levels or at reasonably high levels - now it's not,  he said.
 The question is why was it found the first time and not the second time?
 Where is this BTEX contamination coming from - is the next test going to be positive, is the next test going to be negative? That's what we don't know.
 I guess more to identify the cause, not just the physical testing, but the whole process behind the testing and in the monitoring behind the field.
 I'm sort of thinking that area may require a more in-depth investigation.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Independent Member for Gladstone in central Queensland Liz Cunningham says the State Government needs to start investing money into the city's infrastructure now that a $15 billion gas project is going ahead.
The BG Group has approved the project to pipe coal seam gas from the Surat Basin to a new facility at Curtis Island near Gladstone.
 Ms Cunningham says while she welcomes the opportunities for the region, she wants the Government to act sooner rather than later.
 Infrastructure like the hospital, road infrastructure, the police station in Gladstone is at capacity,  she said.
 The water police need a home because there's going to be a significant increase in port traffic.
 They're working out of what I would describe as less than ideal circumstances.
 They need their own home to properly provide services on the water.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Farmers and environment groups have sounded a warning about the impacts of a $15 billion gas mining project set to go ahead in Gladstone in central Queensland.
British gas giant BG Group announced yesterday it had funding for the project, which will convert coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export, generating thousands of jobs and millions in royalties.
 Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke approved the controversial project less than a fortnight ago, with more than 1,000 conditions on its go-ahead.
But issues surrounding the project's sustainability remain.
A recent Queensland Government report says the proposed gas plant will produce more than 60,000 tonnes of salt per year.
Environmentalists and farmers say the high saline levels could destroy the farming industry and in the long term, damage the precious underground water supplies from the Great Artesian Basin.
Ian Haylorr is a farmer in the Darling Downs and says the BG Group has an exploration lease for coal seam gas on part of his farm.
He also chairs the Basin Sustainability Alliance.
Mr Haylorr says while the project does have potential benefits, many unknowns remain about the long-term effects of the industry on water systems.
 It is a new industry. It has the potential to create a lot of wealth and jobs for Australia,  he said.
 But we are just concerned that there is not enough scientific research into the long-term impacts of this industry on the grain water systems - the Great Artesian Basin - which is already fully allocated to other users.
 We are seeing impacts already or potential impacts. There are existing bores where water levels are declining.
 We are seeing gas leaks coming through to the surface. We are seeing changing water quality in bores and we don't know for sure whether the gas industry is causing these or not, but there is a lot more activity or a lot more problems being identified in the last year or two, when the gas exploration activity increases. 
Belinda Robinson is the chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, which represents the oil and gas industry. She says the project is good news for Queensland industry.
 Plenty of places around world do extract and use coal seam gas for energy production, but Australia and Queensland is now firmly on the international innovation map as being the world's first destination to use it for a liquefied natural gas industry,  she said.
 In terms of decisions taken, there is nothing now that stands between this project being on the drawing board and this project being constructed. The intention is for first gas to be produced in 2014. 
The project is set to increase Queensland's exports by 10 per cent - boosting the coffers for both the Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh.
 This is a tremendously exciting project for Queensland and for Australia. It will deliver a huge boost to the Queensland economy, but also to the Australian economy,  Mr Swan said.
The project is also expected to deliver a jobs boon for the region.
 Money being invested in regional Queensland, jobs being secured. If you are interested in working for this industry, start reading the papers, because the job ads are going to be there,  Ms Bligh said.
Peter Corones was Gladstone's mayor for 14 years and now promotes the region.
 It's fantastic news, it is great news. It is testimony of Gladstone's dynamism in the bigger picture,  he said.
But he acknowledges the potential impacts on healthcare and essential service provision, which have suffered in the north-west of Western Australia during periods of mining booms.
 Those issues are very important and are critical to get the balance right and the words I use are: industry brings about those impacts,  he said.
 It must mitigate and compensate and that is not just the industry. In fact, state and federal governments, realising that this is a small population for the size of the industries that are being facilitated, it is only logical to understand that the population could not bear that sort of impact. 
Despite a federal mining tax and a carbon trading scheme in the pipeline, it would appear investor confidence in Australian mining has not been dampened.
The Queensland gas boom now looks set to continue, with a proposed Santos-led project also given federal environmental approval.
The projects will take total export volumes from Queensland to the same size as the massive Gorgon project in Western Australia.
"
ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Queensland's resources sector says the announcement of $15 billion for a liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone is the first of four possible projects of that size in the state.
The British company BG Group says work is starting this week on its Curtis Island facility, which will be shipping cooled and compressed LNG overseas from 2014.
 Michael Roche, from the Queensland Resources Council, says it's the birth of a new industry for the state and a new export pillar.
 What we have seen is a series of announcements, we've seen investments by some major companies into coal seam gas operations, we've seen state government regulatory approvals, recently we saw federal government regulatory approvals.
 None of that counted for anything without a private sector company putting money on the table. 
BG Group says its plant will need 5000 workers in the construction phase and 1000 permanent workers.
Mr Roche says a lot of the jobs will be for highly skilled people.
 We rapidly need to develop a line of petroleum engineers, for example, there's a lot of opportunities in the whole area of water management.
 We're certainly opening up those careers in seven high schools throughout the Surat Basin as well as in Gladstone.
 These LNG projects are here for 20 or 30 years at least, so there's careers to be made on the back of this investment. 
Mr Roche says the royalties generated from the exports will be good for funding service delivery in the two regions, Gladstone and the Surat Basin, where the BG Group will operate.
He says three other projects of a similar size are under consideration by company boards.
 Probably Santos and their partners are next in line,  he said.
 We know that Origin Energy and their partner ConocoPhillips, a big global gas player, are getting very serious and are getting close to getting their approvals at least through the state government system. 
Mr Roche says the fourth serious player in the race to get LNG projects off the ground is Shell, which has bought into Arrow Energy.
Meanwhile, scientists concede they are still learning about the impact of coal seam gas extraction on underground aquifers and the country itself.
Farmers are extremely worried about the future of rich farming land in the region, particularly soils known as vertisols.
Vertisols have a high clay content, they swell when wet, are subject to compaction and go rock hard when they dry out.
Farmers say the construction of new roads, pipelines and other infrastructure could have a severe impact on their country.
Scientist with the Centre for Mine Rehabilitation at the University of Queensland, Usha Pallai-McGarry, says not a lot of work has been done on the impact of CSG development on these types of soil.
However, she says the vertisols may be difficult to rehabilitate and this could take many years beyond the life of the CSG projects.
 They are highly compactible, so in terms of having pipes laid down, you would have to consider those sort of soils (vertisols) sacrificed for the life of the project. 
"
AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"BG GROUP'S commitment to a $15 billion liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone in Queensland is expected to be followed within months by Santos forging ahead with similar plans.
After winning environmental approval last month, the British energy company announced yesterday that it would proceed with the project, which includes an LNG plant on Curtis Island, a 540-kilometre underground pipeline network and an expansion of production at gasfields in the Surat Basin in south-west Queensland.
 BG plans for the first LNG exports from the plant, which will have an operating life of 20 years, to begin in 2014. Its construction will create 5000 jobs over the next four years.
 These are long-term projects that will most likely outlast the working lives of us all and will transcend political cycles,  said Catherine Tanna, the boss of BG's Australian business, QGC.
The LNG plant will be the first to use coal-seam gas as a feedstock.
Shortly before the federal election, the government asked BG and Santos to revise their environmental impact statements after Queensland's Co-ordinator-General and local communities raised concerns about the impact of the projects on the great artesian basin in inland Australia.
But last month Environment Minister Tony Burke gave conditional approval to both the BG project and the other LNG project planned for Gladstone by Santos.
BG, the third-largest oil and gas producer in Britain, expects the project to result in it paying $1 billion a year in taxes to the federal government and a further $200 million annually in royalties to the Queensland government. It said the tax bill included provisions for the government's resources tax.
Yesterday, federal Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson said the project opened the door to new export opportunities for Australia.  We are now going to see a flurry of activity following the leadership of BG from other competitors in terms of actually delivering similar projects,  he said.
BG has reached agreements to sell LNG to customers in China, Japan, Singapore and Chile and will also provide gas to markets in eastern Australia.
"
AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"BRITISH resources giant BG Group has committed $15.3 billion to a world's-first coal-seam gas project in southern Queensland -- the first of three projects for the region set to transform not only the energy sector but the state and national economy.
The Queensland Curtis LNG Project is expected to come online in 2014, contributing $32bn to the state's economy over the next decade.
 The project will also bring in a projected $1.3bn in tax revenue every year, including $1bn to the federal government, provided Labor can pass its planned mineral resources rent tax.
Announcing the project in Brisbane yesterday, Wayne Swan said LNG projects were ``about bringing home the bacon''.
``It will provide vital support to jobs, to small business, to future investment and it will do that within a framework of environmental protection and the protection of agricultural production,'' the Acting Prime Minister said.
``It will also bring a very substantial boost to Australian exports.''
BG Group expects to create 5000 temporary jobs during the construction process and nearly 1000 additional jobs to keep the operation going.
The key advantage of coal-seam gas is that it can be loaded on to ships and transported to markets that are not necessarily connected to pipelines, such as Japan, China and South Korea.
Under BG's proposal, gas will initially be extracted from deposits deep beneath the Surat Basin in southern Queensland before being sent to a purpose-built LNG plant at the port city of Gladstone via a 540km underground pipe network.
The Gladstone plant will then remove impurities in the gas and cool it to minus 162C before storing it in cryogenic containers. In its frozen state, LNG is 615 times more compact, is not explosive and cannot burn.
Special double-hulled ships can then transport the gas to an LNG terminal at its destination port, where it can be reheated and delivered -- via local pipelines -- to its end user.
Another advantage is that it leaves the coal seam in place and available for other forms of mining, either through straight extraction or by being burnt off using contentious underground coal gasification.
BG Group is only the leader of the pack, with Adelaide-based competitor Santos receiving its federal government approval at the same time last month.
Another major proposal -- a 50-50 joint venture between Origin and ConocoPhillips -- is awaiting its tick from the Bligh government.
``I think we're now going to see a flurry of activity following the leadership of BG from other competitors in terms of actually delivering similar projects,'' Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said.
But for all its advantages, the industry has also had its share of controversy, with farmers on the Darling Downs forming an unusual alliance with green groups to oppose the projects.
Farmers are concerned that dangerous saline water, which is used to extract the gas from the coal seams, could be returned to local water supplies.
Addressing those concerns, BG Group executive vice-president Catherine Tanna said the water would be treated ``to quite a pure quality'' before being returned to farms and communities.
``We have not been deaf or blind to the fears some hold about our potential impact,'' said Ms Tanna, who is a Gladstone native.
Environmentalists have also raised the alarm. Queensland

Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters called for a moratorium on the carbon-intensive industry.
Mr Ferguson hit back at Ms Waters yesterday, saying LNG could produce the same amount of energy as coal with about 35per cent lower carbon dioxide emissions. ``This is not just good for Australia,'' he said. ``When you think about a place such as China, the export of our gas can have a huge contribution in reducing global CO2 emissions.
``I say to people like senator-elect Waters, you can't have your cake and eat it. You can't say we have to confront our need to reduce CO2 emissions and then be opposed to transition clean energy opportunities such as gas.''
Ms Tanna said the plant would use the world's second-least carbon intensive LNG technology, and was inferior only to technology used in the Arctic circle, where the climate was more accommodating. Concerns have also been raised for the safety of protected species, such as turtles, in the waters around Gladstone.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"BG Group's announcement it will spend $US15 billion ($15.2bn) on the nation's second-biggest single resource investment -- and the biggest ever on the east coast -- will hearten shareholders at its coal-seam gas rivals Santos and Origin.
The decision puts BG at the head of the race to export Queensland's vast coal-seam gas resources. It also puts the British gas giant in a better negotiating position in any consolidation talks between four projects planning to send liquefied natural gas from Gladstone to Asia.
 But the speed of the decision -- after Tony Burke's condition-laden federal environmental approval, and the lack of any surprises in cost estimates -- is the best indication yet that the east coast's gas will be opened to export markets. This is despite legitimate concerns over CSG-to-LNG's environmental effects and continued wrangling over the tax regimes under which the massive projects will operate.
It took Frank Chapman and the BG board just a week after Burke's decision to sign off on the company's biggest investment to date, at a Friday board meeting in London. Chapman had flown into Australia in late June to nail down a tax deal with Kevin Rudd that was thwarted when he was ousted by Julia Gillard.
There was industry speculation that Chapman was about to gain clearance from former environment minister Peter Garrett and then be able to announce a final investment decision on the Queensland Curtis LNG project.
More than four months later, had BG still not been able to sign off on its plans almost immediately after Burke's conditional approval, serious doubts about the sector's ability to get started at viable prices would have crept into Australian investors' minds.
BG and Santos remain the two best-placed projects to drive the consolidation that Resources Minister Martin Ferguson says will come as surely ``as night follows day''.
The next eight weeks will see crucial positioning on this front.
Santos says it is on track for its final investment decision on a first train by the end of the year, leaving open the possibility for a partner to participate on a second. And Conoco Phillips boss Jim Mulva, who half-owns the APLNG project with Origin, says he plans to have two trains (production plants) worth of gas sold in that time.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND'S gas boom was officially launched yesterday with BG Group committing $US15 billion to build a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant at Curtis Island near Gladstone.
BG became the first company to put its money on the table and place in train plans to export LNG to a number of countries including Chile, China, Japan and Singapore.
 Work begins this week on construction of the plant, which will take four years to build and involve the creation of more than 5000 jobs.
``This is a very significant milestone for the Australian economy,'' Acting Prime Minister Wayne Swan said yesterday at a press conference in Brisbane with Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and BG executive vice president, Catherine Tanna.
The project involves building a gas plant at Gladstone, a 450km underground pipeline network and expanding production in gas fields in the Surat Basin around Chinchilla in southwest Queensland.
It is estimated the project will increase gross state product by up to $32 billion between 2010 and 2021 and will add nearly 10 per cent, or about $4 billion a year, to the value of Queensland's annual exports.
It is understood that BG competitor Santos will make a decision on proceeding with its own LNG plant at Gladstone in the next four to six weeks.
Mr Ferguson said while Coal Seam Gas and LNG were not new industries, the financial commitment by BG Group was the first move toward exporting gas offshore.
``This is about bringing home the bacon to Queensland. It is about creating jobs on the ground and is a great boost for regional Queensland and Australia,'' he said.
Ms Tanna said the 5000 jobs would be created in construction alone and from 2014 nearly 1000 additional jobs would be created in operations.
``Critically, this project - and the new industry it spawns - will provide a sustainable future for many regional Queensland towns and communities which, without this sort of development, may continue to decline,'' she said, adding that water used during the extraction process would be treated ``to quite a pure quality'' and returned to farms and communities.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton disagreed, last night describing the project as ``a catastrophe for rural Queensland'' because of its implications for the underground water system.
``Yes, there are 1500 conditions in place but they have been given these approvals and are now required to prove them rather than the other way around,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"YESTERDAY'S announcement that British energy company BG will go ahead with its $15 billion liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone is the opening of a new chapter in Queensland's economic history.
Queensland and natural resources have gone hand in glove almost since separation 150 years ago. From the initial discoveries of gold and coal to later finds of other semi-precious minerals, natural resources have kept our state prosperous, and allowed Queensland to remain decentralised and geographically diverse. In fact, without the natural resources sector, Queensland - indeed Australia - would have sunk beneath the waves like so many other economies during the recent global financial crisis, with the social impact on regional and rural Queensland especially devastating.
 Instead, we can thank the extractive industries for an enviable economic record shared across the regions. And with this latest investment secure, we can expect thousands of jobs - mostly in central Queensland - and a $32 billion injection into the Queensland economy over the next decade. As the first LNG project based on coal seam gas, Queensland is also something of a global technological pioneer, and will rival Western Australia as the nation's gas-producing hub.
Of course no project as significant as this can emerge without scepticism or vigorous scrutiny. In a democracy of competing interests - including the economic - that is both healthy and necessary.
For one, there will be some who condemn the project as a return to Queensland's ``farm and quarry'' mentality. Where just a few years ago former premier Peter Beattie made a conscious pitch to broaden our economic base to include biotechnology and become the so-called ``Smart State'' - a sobriquet since ignored by successor Anna Bligh - this Government's embrace of LNG might be interpreted as a soft economic option that relies on environmental exploitation. Concerns have also been raised by farmers, with thousands of holes to be drilled for water to be pumped from the seam enabling gas to rise to the surface.
And, quite rightly, environmentalists have demanded to know what, if any, ecological impact LNG extraction will have on central Queensland and, in particular, the water table. It is a pertinent, indeed essential, question.
The state and federal governments have assured the public they have placed the proper scrutiny and restrictions on the project.
Queensland imposed 1200 conditions, and the final tick for BG - coming just a week ago - was given only after Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke imposed more than 300 conditions of his own.
In fact, developers in Australia today must jump more, and higher, environmental and safety hurdles than at any other point in our history. This is just the start of a huge new energy boom, with a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total also gaining approval, and the Government cannot allow the high level of scrutiny to wane.
If managed properly the gas projects will provide enormous benefits for Queensland, but the revenues must be used wisely and weighed carefully against any environmental dangers.
"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE resources sector last night welcomed the news BG Group will spend $15.25 billion on its Gladstone LNG plant, hailing the move as an evolution of coal seam gas from a mining by-product to a multibillion-dollar export industry.
Rick Wilkinson, the Brisbane-based head of LNG for Santos, which is expected to announce final plans to build its own plant at Gladstone by December, said it was another major boost for the industry.
 ``It builds confidence in the industry and clearly there is a momentum behind a major industry for Queensland,'' Mr Wilkinson said.
Merrill Lynch analyst James Bullen estimated that the cost of the Santos project, with two production units, may be as high as $20 billion.
Korea Gas Corp, the world's biggest buyer of LNG, said earlier this month it was involved in talks to acquire a 15 per cent stake in Santos's Gladstone project.
Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche described the rise of the state's coal seam gas industry over the past 15 years as ``a phenomenal achievement''.
``Queensland has never seen a financial investment and technology uptake of the magnitude surrounding the birth of this new export pillar for Australia's future,'' Mr Roche said.
``A coal seam gas-based export industry has moved literally from pipedream to economic reality in less than a decade, but with all the built-in safeguards that the community expects.''
BG executive vice president Catherine Tanna said the project approvals included about 1500 conditions and the requirement for more than 800 production licences, safety certificates and other environmental permits ranging from pipelines to land access to gas tenements.
While BG did not break down the costs of adhering to the various conditions, analysts have put the expenses at more than $20 million.
BG and Santos both won federal approval for their Queensland LNG projects last week and must now comply with about 1500 state and federal conditions. ``We wouldn't be here today unless we thought we could deliver the project based on those conditions,'' Ms Tanna said.
BG has agreements to sell LNG to customers in China, Japan, Singapore and Chile and will also provide gas to markets in eastern Australia. The project will have an operating life of at least 20 years and will create more than 5000 construction jobs over the next four years.
BG will begin with two processing units that will have a combined capacity of 8.5 million metric tonnes of LNG a year, and according to Ms Tanna ``there is significant potential to expand''.
The project is expected to produce a third of Australia's LNG in the first stage.
Mr Roche said it would generate enormous benefits for Australia and Queensland.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"ANALYSIS
The pace of progress in Queensland's coal seam gas sector is astonishing.
 Only a few years ago, the idea of liquefied natural gas being shipped from the east coast of Australia seemed fanciful.
While BG started notionally behind Santos in the Queensland LNG race after BG's 2008 acquisition of Queensland Gas Co, the British group rapidly overtook its smaller rival.
BG's ability to secure rapidly real LNG sales contracts has been the key to its pace. BG has been able to underpin the sales volumes promised from Queensland with volumes from its international portfolio, putting to bed any buyer concerns about the yet-to-be-proven coal seam gas-to-LNG process.
So where does yesterday's decision leave the two local companies competing with BG in Queensland's LNG sector? Santos has long held that the first two projects up and running will hold a major advantage over the other proposed developments. While shareholders would dearly love to see one more customer signed up by the company, even without that Santos feels capable of sanctioning its Gladstone LNG project by year's end.
Origin's Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with ConocoPhillips is less clear. They have recently talked up their ability to have APLNG ready for a final investment decision this year, but it is impossible to see how the pair could follow through without signing up some customers in a hurry.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The development of a new, lucrative liquefied natural gas export industry on Australia's east coast is almost assured following BG Group's commitment to build a pioneering $US15 billion project.
The British energy giant delivered a final investment decision yesterday, approving its Curtis liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, which will use coal seam gas from the state's Surat and Bowen basins to produce LNG, primarily for sale to energy-hungry Asian markets.
 It is the first of at least four similar developments planned for the port of Gladstone to be given a formal go-ahead. The total proposed investment in the area is estimated at more than $50 billion.
Speaking from BG's Queensland office, executive vice-president Australia Catherine Tanna said the project would rank as the single biggest undertaking in the Â£40 billion company's history.
 Three years ago, when BG Group set up in Australia, we had an idea,  Ms Tanna said.  Today, we have a project.
 Over the next four years we will build the world's first liquefied natural gas plant to use coal seam gas as a feedstock and in doing so we will create a new industry for Queensland. 
It will involve building an initial two-train plant at Gladstone capable of producing 8.5 million tonnes of LNG a year and a 540-kilometre underground pipeline network.
The project is expected to create 5000 new jobs during construction and 1000 new jobs once operational in 2014. It is expected to increase economic activity in Queensland by $32 billion over the next decade.
Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association chief executive Belinda Robinson hailed the approval, saying the economic and employment benefits from the project would be  profound .
But she said the development of the Queensland LNG industry would be just as significant from an environmental perspective.
 When Australian LNG is used in place of coal to generate electricity in customer countries, up to nine tonnes of greenhouse gases are avoided for every tonne produced in the production, liquefaction and export process,  Ms Robinson said.
BG's final investment decision on the project came just over a week after federal Environment Minister Tony Burke gave conditional approval to the project and Santos's $16 billion Gladstone LNG project.
In reaching his decision, Mr Burke said the companies must adhere to more than 300 conditions, including rigorous monitoring of the Great Artesian Basin, one of the world's largest underground water sources.
He also said there had been no evidence either project had issues with cancer-causing chemicals that were recently detected in eight coal seam gas wells owned by Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips in Queensland.
Santos is expected to make a final investment decision on Gladstone LNG before the end of the year. A company spokesman yesterday welcomed BG's decision as  a vote of confidence in the industry .
Origin and ConocoPhillips also maintain they will be in a position to make a decision on their $35 billion Asia-Pacific LNG project by the end of next month, however, analysts expect delays because the partners have not yet identified customers.
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson, who was in Queensland yesterday, said BG was  the leader of the pack  and it was now for its competitors to respond. He expected consolidation between the various players in the Queensland LNG sector would occur over time.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Santos tried to put a positive spin on BG Group's decision to approve its $US15 billion Queensland project yesterday, calling it a vote of confidence in the entire coal-seam gas to liquefied natural gas sector.
But for many investors, the BG approval is also likely to serve as a reminder of the agonisingly slow pace of Santos's negotiations with Korea Gas. Kogas has been sitting on the paperwork for a major LNG purchase agreement for Santos's Gladstone LNG project for what feels like an eternity. The agreement would see Kogas commit to buying the bulk of the remaining uncontracted cargoes out of the first two LNG trains â€“ or processing lines â€“ at GLNG, providing enough certainty for Santos to pursue the mega $15 billion-plus project.
 In addition, the deal would allow Kogas to purchase a 15 per cent equity stake in GLNG, including 10 per cent from Santos. Assuming it was carried out at similar terms to Total's recent purchase of a stake in GLNG, Kogas would be looking at about $650 million for the deal.
(A $1 billion or so equity raising is also likely to be needed for Santos to fund a two-train project.)
Funnily enough â€“ and this is where the tease kicks in for Santos â€“ Kogas has been busily locking in finance that suggests a deal must not be far away. Most recently, the company raised $US500 million in US dollar-denominated bonds to fund  mid- and long-term overseas development projects .
Of course, Santos has seen such signs of promise before. In September, Kogas raised Sfr300 million ($312.3 million) through two bond tranches, piquing hopes of the deal being done soon. As far as causes of the continued delay goes, Kogas would seem to be running out of excuses for not signing. The federal government approval of the GLNG environmental impact statement was received over a week ago., and industry feedback suggests none of the 300 conditions attached to the approval are likely to have an unexpectedly material impact on how GLNG or any of the proposed Queensland projects operate. Nitpickers may have also queried the ability of the currently defined reserve base at GLNG to support a two-train, 7.2 million tonne a year development, but Santos should have eased those concerns with last week's announcement that it could pipe gas from its existing Cooper Basin operations at negligible impact to the project's economics.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"It may be Spring Racing Carnival but that hasn't stopped the rumour mill from churning, with Pacific Equity Partners' Griffin's Foods and the coal seam gas sector two of the hottest topics.
While PEP is sticking to its guns that the biscuit and snack food company which it acquired from French food behemoth Danone Asia Pte Ltd in April 2006 isn't going anywhere for at least a year, there's a sense that it is still likely to join the increasingly strong queue of fiscal 2011 exits.
 This may be just the wishful thinking of some investment bankers but there's still a strong feeling that PEP is moving towards running a process.
Griffin's is viewed as a highly attractive asset with a potential price-tag of up to $1 billion. A logical buyer in the private equity space is Blackstone which owns United Biscuits, while Goodman Fielder has been previously pointed to as a potential trade acquirer.
Elsewhere, talk suggests a number of companies are having a close look at the smaller end of the coal seam gas sector.
BG Group and Santos both need more gas now that they have gone through the final investment decision stage (or are about to) and are on the prowl. With that in mind, it is understood Bow Energy is already firmly on the radar of one of the majors.
Arrow Energy offshoot Dart Energy announced a friendly scrip-based merger with smaller partner Apollo Gas in September. Dart's Australian assets also include stakes in Bow Energy and Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd.
Molopo Australia, Icon Energy and WestSide Corporation are also expected to garner interest to a lesser extent. Finally, it's worth noting that QR National's Lance Hockridge and Deb O'Toole have finished the Asian third of the institutional investor roadshow for the $6 billion float.
There's been some encouraging signs coming out of the region with Credit Suisse having successfully priced the Hong Kong initial public offering of AIA Group. The deal size was $US17.8 billion (pre-shoe)/ $US20.5 billion (post-shoe) and the stock finished its first day of trade up 17 per cent.
Hockridge and O'Toole reached Frankfurt on Friday and will be in London and Edinburgh next week.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2010,4,"Farmers in southwest Queensland are preparing to do battle with miners keen to explore their land for gas and coal.
A decision on Sunday by the BG Group to commit $15 billion to a liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone is expected to spark a  gas rush  in the Surat Basin, west of Brisbane.
 The BG proposal includes a 450km underground pipeline network and expanding production in gas fields in the Surat Basin around Chinchilla.
Lee McNicholl, who farms cattle and grain to the west at Dulacca, doesn't want a bar of it.
 There's no sound science to underpin most of the provisions that the government has approved for BG,  Mr McNicholl said.
 There are just a whole lot of unknown unknowns, and the government's adopted the attitude that if there's a major stuff-up, well, we'll fix it up when it happens.
 That's totally unacceptable. 
Mr McNicholl said he would lock the farm gates against explorers and many farmers shared his sentiments.
 I'm gearing up to fight, I've had a gutful,  he said.
Local farmers were on Tuesday organising resistance to the miners as the pace of exploration heats up.
 I haven't had any trouble yet, but I know it's only a matter of time,  Mr McNicholl said.
He said land values had already plummeted as mining was given precedence over agriculture.
 There's a real reluctance of people to invest in agriculture in Queensland, particularly in the Surat Basin, at the moment,  he said.
 In Queensland, agriculture is being relegated to a very poor second to mining.
 All the security is being given to the mining industry, and no security is being given to agriculture. 
He said recent auctions of farmland had received no bids, while others had sold at well below expectations.
 There's country out from Wandoan just next to a mine, normally $1250 (an acre), back to $1100. 
An estimated 40,000 coal seam gas wells will be drilled in the Surat Basin, Friends of the Earth estimates.
The Queensland government has announced a series of community information sessions to explain how the new Land Access Code relates to conduct and compensation, dispute resolution and contract compliance between landowners and resource companies.
Information sessions will be held in Dalby, Roma, Quilpie, Longreach, Emerald, Moranbah, Townsville, Mount Isa and Mareeba from November 15 to 26.
 The new laws will ensure landholders have greater certainty about their rights when approached about access to their land by petroleum, gas, geothermal or greenhouse gas companies,  Acting Mines and Energy Minister Geoff Wilson said.
 They also ensure landholders will be fairly compensated for the impact of activities undertaken by resource companies on their land, and that companies must take steps to minimise impacts on the existing land use and business operations.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A company investing $15 billion in a Queensland gas project says its construction workforce will peak near 3,000 in Gladstone in the state's central region next year.
The Federal Government approved two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects last month and the UK-based BG Group announced on the weekend that it would start work on its $15 billion project this week.
 Mark Todd from QGC, a subsidiary of BG Group, says there will be a total of 5,000 construction jobs over the next four years across central Queensland to the Surat Basin.
Mr Todd says prospective workers have been interested in working on the project since it was announced in 2008, but Sunday's announcement that it will go ahead has sparked a flurry of activity.
 Most of the demand will be for skilled workers across a range of positions - things like carpenters, welders, electricians, steel fixers, riggers, boilermakers and other trades,  he said.
 In fact, we received 16 enquiries at our office in Gladstone in the first hour of opening after the announcement on Sunday. 
Meanwhile, a Gladstone real estate agent says first home buyers could be priced out of the local market because of the LNG industry.
Real estate agent Jock Gaughan says there has been a lot of interest since Sunday.
 Anything like this is going to be good for the town - it's certainly going to bring a lot of income and a lot of money into the area,  he said.
 I think the only downside is there'll be a lot of young people who might not be able to afford houses over the next couple of years.
 I think anybody who is looking at buying houses needs to do it now rather than leave it for a year or two.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,4,"Approval will stimulate region
Acting Prime Minister Wayne Swan met with the Federal Resources Minister and Queensland Gas Company Managing Director Catherine Tanna, to confirm BG Group's financial approval for QGC's Liquefied Natural Gas project on Sunday.
 The announcement made in Brisbane's CBD will change the Darling Downs forever.
The project involves laying a 540 kilometre underground pipeline to pump gas from the gasfields near Chinchilla to Gladstone where it will be exported.
The world's first liquefied natural gas plant to use coal seam gas as a feedstock will be built at Gladstone.
As of yesterday, the project will generate 5000 jobs in between the Surat Basin and Gladstone during the establishment phase and when the first LNG exports are scheduled from 2014, QGC anticipates there will be 1000 ongoing jobs.
The $15 billion commitment was the single biggest investment in the United Kingdom-based company's history.
Ms Tanna said the new industry created by the LNG project would provide a sustainable future for many regional Queensland towns and communities, which without this sort of development, may continue to decline.
Responding to what Mr Swan called â€œa very big job generator for Australiaâ€?, Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown welcomed the boom to the region, provided the industry ticks all the boxes.
â€œCouncil certainly expected the announcement, but when the Federal approval came through on Friday with the extra conditions, it wasn't â€˜in the bag' because of the extra financial commitment,â€? Cr Brown said.
â€œThose 1200 State conditions were very appropriate. Whether there should be more or less is a matter of contention, but if the company believes it can fulfil those 1500 regulations then we have protected what our community expects to be protected.â€?
Despite Mr Swan describing the protection of the environment and agricultural land as sacrosanct and calling the Environmental Impact Statement â€œa rigorous processâ€?, Cr Brown, other landholders and activists argued that it did not fully protect the Great Artesian Basin.
Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton said the Queensland public was victim to a â€œsmoke and mirrors deceptionâ€?.
â€œThe Federal and State Governments have imposed a large number of conditions on the project but they have allowed the project to go ahead without obliging the company to show how they will meet these conditions,â€? Mr Hutton said.
But Cr Brown doesn't see the final approval as the end of the road.
He believed the region deserved its fair share of the pie being sliced up.
â€œThe big elephant in the room is the Federal Government, who will collect one billion dollars annually and the State Government is gaining $300 million,â€?Cr Brown said.
â€œAll we're after is a small proportion to come back to the regions and that can be in any form of infrastructure, soft or hard, to address the impact now as it happens, not in arrears as a reaction.
â€œWe have a strong and vibrant agriculture sector and lifestyle already, and we are getting a mining sector imposed on us, therefore the impact on our infrastructure must be shared between state, federal and the companies. It's not all done and dusted and we will be monitoring it very closely.â€?

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"THE ink had barely dried on an agreement by British-owned BG Group to pump more than $15 billion into Australia's new coal-seam gas industry when the phones started ringing in businesses in Chinchilla.
Currently home to about 6000 people, the rural community 300km west of Brisbane is at the centre of Queensland's first coal-seam methane to liquefied natural gas industry following confirmation the oil and gas giant's project will proceed.
 Real estate agent Bruce Booth said the green light was good news for the town. ``It's sure to kick things along,'' he said.
The Queensland Curtis LNG project will sink 6000 gas wells across the Surat Basin, then pipe the gas 540km to a processing plant off Gladstone.
Pipe has been arriving in the town this week, and jobs are being filled, including 100 administration staff based in Chinchilla, and four work camps of 650 workers each to construct the project across the western Darling Downs.
Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown oversees the previously agricultural region, which is rapidly becoming an industrial centre. ``It will certainly change the outcomes of our community: some people will see it as a negative, but I truly believe the majority will see it as a positive.''
Mr Brown said a commitment from BG Group that 1000 of the expected 5000 workers would live and work in the western Darling Downs area was extremely positive for its future.
At the other end of operations in Gladstone, former mayor Peter Corones asserted the city of 60,000 had the industrial know-how and infrastructure to benefit from the project.
Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters sounded a note of caution about the expected increase in shipping from the LNG projects and warned of the risk of more ship groundings and spills.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"ENERGY: Inpex has called tenders for the offshore gas platform of the $US20 billion-plus ($20.2bn-plus) Ichthys liquefied natural gas project it is planning at Darwin.
The Japanese company yesterday brushed off speculation it was suffering delays to its timetable, reiterating a fourth-quarter 2011 final investment decision target.
 First production is targeted for late 2016.
``The release of invitations to tender demonstrates our commitment to delivering our flagship Ichthys project and confirms we are moving forward towards a final investment decision as scheduled,'' Inpex Australia president Seiya Ito said.
Inpex is planning to produce 8.4 million tonnes of LNG a year by piping gas from the Browse Basin off Western Australia 820km to an onshore plant.
Inpex shifted its plant from Western Australia to Darwin because it was unable to get state approval quickly.
The semi-submersible gas platform that has gone out to tender will be one of the biggest in the world. It will remove water and up to 100,000 barrels a day of condensate (a light, high-value oil) from the gas.
Mr Ito said some of the world's leading engineering and construction companies had qualified for the tender, but Inpex would not say who they were.
Inpex plans to invite tenders for the 820km pipeline before the end of the year. It will also invite tenders for the offshore work, including a floating production, storage and offloading ship that will treat and store condensate.
The process for the Darwin plant will start next year.
Mr Ito said no one at the company was underestimating the challenges of developing a project the size of Ichthys. ``Nor should we underestimate the opportunities the project holds for the Northern Territory and Australian economies.''
The project is 24 per cent owned by French energy major Total, which has taken a stake in the Santos-operated Gladstone LNG project.
Total has indicated it may take a larger stake in Ichthys.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE coal seam gas industry is facing a rural revolt with farmers yesterday threatening to risk arrest and lock their gates to drilling companies.
A massive expansion of the industry was ignited on the weekend when BG Group-owned Queensland Gas gave the go-ahead for a $15 billion liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone that will be fuelled by coal seam gas from the Surat Basin. Santos, Origin and Shell are all trying to firm up their own massive LNG projects.
 But farmers from Dalby to west of Miles, as well as activists and the Tara blockies, are refusing to bow to the companies which will drill thousands of wells on farmland over the next 20 years.
Lee McNicol, who farms at Dulacca, west of Miles, said the region was going to be turned into a pin cushion of gas wells.
``There will be long-term environmental effect and short-term farming effect,'' Mr McNicol said.
He said he was prepared to refuse the companies entry to his property and face arrest.
``I certainly am and I'm looking forward to it,'' he said.
Mr McNicol has underground coal gasification tenements over his property and CSG is moving closer, adding to concerns about the effects on groundwater.
``I'm concerned about sustainable agriculture,'' he said.
Graham Back, a quietly spoken organic farmer from west of Dalby, also has vowed to lock his gates.
``I'm not usually a militant person. I would not resort to violence, but I'm not welcoming them on, I'm not rolling out the red carpet,'' Mr Back said.
``I'm frustrated and disappointed. I've been fearing this for years. They will destroy my organic certification.
``I believe in organic farming and I'm not going back to chemicals.''
He said only a small portion of his farm was immediately at threat but his neighbours either had wells or were about to get them and he could expect further exploration and development in the future.
Chinchilla landowner Dane Pratzky said he did not fear being arrested.
``There's no two ways about it. We are prepared to get arrested and, if and when we are released, we'll lock them out again,'' he said.
Macalister farmer Geoff Hewitt said there was a great deal of anxiety in the farming community.
He said the companies could work co-operatively with farmers and have minimal impact ``but if they ride roughshod over us the gloves are off''.
Farmers from the Basin Sustainability Alliance will meet on Thursday to discuss their strategy but president Ian Hayllor said a lock-out was not going to achieve anything.
``We have come a long way in six months and we don't want to jeopardise that,'' he said.
North Dulacca farmer Phillip Jays said the only way the CSG companies could get on his land was if they came ``with a bloody big chequebook''.
His concern was the depletion of acquifers through the CSG extraction process.
``We've had a drought for 10 years. Are we going to create another one?'' he said.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said farmers were facing possible irreversible damage to the Great Artesian Basin.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"BG Group's go-ahead for its $US15 billion ($A15.2 billion) Queensland Curtis liquefied natural gas plant off Gladstone boosted the shares of its two big competitors, Santos and Origin Energy yesterday.
And with coal seam gas-to-LNG looking set to become a reality, it also set alight some of the smaller players in CSG, which will fuel the planned Gladstone plants.
 Investor enthusiasm faded somewhat during the day, however, and all the CSG players finished off their highs.
BG's Australian arm QGC managing director Catherine Tanna said the funding commitment was ``the final piece of the puzzle'' for its Gladstone project. Santos, Origin and Royal Dutch Shell are the main players in the three projects competing with BG.
CLSA Asia- Pacific Markets analyst Di Brookman said yesterday Santos was probably not far behind BG in making its own final investment decision.
Santos and its partners are expected to bring in Korea Gas - to provide a final key gas off-take contract - into their consortium. Santos shares closed up 9 at $12.71 after touching $12.79 earlier in the day.
Ms Brookman said BG's development may cost less than the one proposed by Santos, partly because the UK gas giant can negotiate better prices with contractors such as US engineering company Bechtel, which BG uses regularly.
Other contractors include WorleyParsons, which will oversee the gas field facilities and infrastructure development. WorleyParsons shares fell 5c to $22.90 yesterday.
MCJV, a joint venture between McConnell Dowell Constructors and Consolidated Contractors Co will handle the transmission pipeline network from the gas fields to Gladstone.
Origin shares performed relatively poorly yesterday, given ConocoPhillips, its US partner in the Australia Pacific LNG project, last week talked bullishly about it soon signing up customers.
Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood reckons the best Origin may be able to do is commit to a single LNG train development initially. Both BG and Santos will have two production units or ``trains''. Origin shares added 4c to $15.95 after earlier hitting $16.05.
Bow Energy led the smaller players higher, finishing up 5c at $1.21 while WestSide Corp - which announced yesterday that its partner in the Meridian gas project near Moura in central Queensland would exercise an option to farm into its frontier Galilee Basin CSG ground - was up 1.5c to 42c.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Shell's man, Andrew Faulkner, has taken the top job at Arrow to transform it for its new owners, writes Angela Macdonald-Smith.
Andrew Faulkner, the new chief executive at Arrow Energy, is used to being at the forefront of liquefied natural gas developments for Royal Dutch Shell.
 After all, he led the team that took the oil giant's revolutionary floating LNG plan from a conceptual idea to an actual project off Australia's north-west coast.
Now he has another task in front of him of arguably just as much significance: heading up the new, unlisted Arrow, under its joint owners Shell and PetroChina, as it seeks to develop one of the world's first LNG projects fuelled by gas from coal seams.
Shell and PetroChina completed their $3.45 billion takeover of Arrow in August and will use Arrow's extensive coal seam gas reserves in Queensland to feed a multibillion-dollar LNG project on Gladstone's Curtis Island. The partners have also committed to buying the LNG, eliminating any risks around gas marketing.
Faulkner, who joined Shell International straight from Auckland University in 1982, is clearly enthused about his new role:  in a strange way I feel I've been in training for this job for 28 years,  he says,  it's one of those things sometimes you just think it's right .
The New Zealander, a passionate sportsman who has competed in the gruelling Ironman New Zealand race, is relishing the task ahead.
 What greater opportunity could a person have than to join a company that has done so much in such a short period of time, and clearly is a fantastic bunch of people, then to take that company and mould it and turn it onto a new journey that is going to be equally exciting and equally as large, in a location that is not far from New Zealand. 
Faulkner's career with Shell spans assignments in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia and includes a variety of roles, from new business development and project execution through to production and pipeline operations. Before the Arrow assignment brought him to Brisbane he was based in Singapore, responsible for facilitating LNG marketing in the key markets of Japan, South Korea and China.
While there he was also closely involved with another LNG mega-project, the Sakhalin-2 venture in eastern Russia now majority owned by Gazprom where for five years he sat as one of the two Shell representatives on the board of directors.
On top of that was the two-year stint leading Shell's floating LNG (FLNG) program which culminated in a decision last year to start front-end engineering and design work at the Prelude project in the Browse Basin, Western Australia, which could become the world's first FLNG plant.
 It's one of those rare moments in your career where in 10 to 15 years you could look back and say, I was part of something that was a bit of a game-changer in the oil and gas industry,  says Faulkner, a civil engineer by education.
The same could be said of Arrow, although Arrow will not be the first to build an LNG plant based on coal seam gas (CSG), being several steps behind British rival BG Group which has already reached a final investment decision on its $US15 billion project in Queensland.
Faulkner is only pencilling in a final investment decision for 2012 or 2013 on Arrow's project, which will sit alongside BG's and two other plants led by Santos and Origin Energy, also planned for Curtis Island.
But he is adamant Shell's relative late entry into the CSG-LNG scene in Gladstone is no disadvantage for Arrow, particularly since it already has its sales markets tied up.
 It's not a race,  he says.
One of Faulkner's initial challenges will be to integrate the old Arrow with Shell's LNG business in Queensland that was already working on the Gladstone project. While Shell already had executives seconded to Arrow since its 2008 acquisition of 30 per cent of Arrow's CSG acreage, the amalgamation will involve a huge cultural and organisational change.
The focus of the old listed Arrow on acquisitions, new business and growth now needs to change to one concentrating on major project delivery, with the skills and capability to match, Faulkner says.
And while Shell's commitment to its Queensland venture is periodically the topic of some market speculation given the major's multiple competing LNG interests in Australia, Faulkner is adamant he is lacking nothing from Arrow's owners.
 All I can say is I am receiving every support a CEO would ever want from its two parents in terms of pursuing the project,  he says.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"It was lost amid the news of BG Group's Queensland Curtis liquefied natural gas project's final investment decision at the weekend but, in the hours before the $US15 billion project was signed off, BG secured another LNG offtake agreement.
Offtake agreements â€“ this one was with Japanese utility Chubu Electric â€“ are crucial in satisfying LNG developers and their financiers that there will be buyers for the product once the huge investment is complete.
 The Chubu deal made little difference to the strength of QCLNG, with almost all planned production from the project having been snapped up. But for the other Queensland LNG hopefuls, the deal means one less LNG buyer for them to woo.
Santos and its Gladstone LNG project would have been largely unconcerned, given its existing LNG offtake agreements, but Origin Energy's Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with ConocoPhillips is in a different position. The pair are yet to secure a single buyer. That's despite their aim of reaching a final investment decision by December 31. It seems the only ones who believe APLNG can make it to a final investment decision this year are Origin and ConocoPhillips themselves.Origin has also added the caveat that it expects to have the project  ready  for FID by the end of the year, subject to offtake being secured.
The engineering and design studies for the project should be complete but, without firm offtake agreements, APLNG will be all dressed up with nowhere to go.
Certainly the Origin share price suggests the market has little confidence in APLNG going ahead as planned.
Origin shares are still broadly trading today where they were when Origin struck its landmark deal with ConocoPhillips in 2008.
Citigroup notes that based on recent transactions in the coal-seam gas sector, - prices which are down on the highs of 2008 and early 2009 - Origin's share of APLNG should be worth $4.60 to $6.05 a share. Barely any of that is factored into Origin's share price of $15.98, with the upper value potentially lifting Origin towards $20 a share.
The market, it would seem, will only start valuing APLNG when customers start to commit.
Adding to the task in front of APLNG is that it is proposing to produce 9 million tonnes a year of LNG, compared with 7 million tonnes a year from each of QCLNG and GLNG.
That may sound pretty bleak, but there's one fact that Origin certainly hasn't forgotten â€“ and which Origin shareholders should keep in mind. Origin and APLNG has plenty of gas, more than either of the more advanced LNG rivals.
One just needs to look at the situation in Western Australia's LNG industry to realise the difference that a big resource and reserve base can have. Woodside's Pluto-2 expansion can leverage off the $13 billion invested in the project's first stage, but it is Chevron's Wheatstone that now appears to have much of the momentum with customers. The key difference? Chevron and its partners have plenty of gas, while Woodside continues to drill to prove up its reserves.
Similarly, American company Hess does not and will not have its own LNG plant in Western Australia but given it has its foot on one of the most prolific and potentially gas-rich leases in the Carnarvon Basin, it enjoys something of a role as kingmaker in the Woodside versus Chevron battle.
That strong reserve position is particularly important given recent developments in Queensland. The slower than expected upgrade of reserves within GLNG has been well demonstrated by Santos's decision to vend more of its acreage into the venture, as well as its talk of piping gas from its Cooper Basin operations into Queensland. BG has been more tight-lipped but there are anecdotes being whispered in the industry about reserve upgrades not quite matching with expectations.
APLNG is in joint venture on leases with both companies, and selling some of its gas into the rival projects would be a simple, low-risk way of realising more value for assets that the market seems intent to largely ignore.
ConocoPhillips, having seemingly paid over the odds for its share in APLNG, may not like the look of such a deal but, either way, there must be more value in Origin's APLNG stake than the market is willing to recognise.Paul Garvey pgarvey@afr.com.au

PORT MORESBY, Nov 3 AAP - The United States is committed to preventing mineral-rich Papua New Guinea suffering a 'resource curse' linked to a massive ExxonMobil Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says.
 Ms Clinton was in Port Moresby on Wednesday afternoon where she met women's groups, promoted mangrove planting as part of climate change efforts and met with PNG officials during a brief visit as part of her regional tour.
High on the list of bilateral issue was the $16 billion LNG project hyped to double PNG's gross domestic product with at least 30 years of gas sales to Asian buyers once it comes online after 2014.
PNG has failed to turn its numerous mining revenue streams into real development, suffering some of the world's worst social and health indicators, especially so for women.
 The United States stands ready to help translate your country's natural resources into widespread prosperity,  Ms Clinton told reporters.
Many countries like PNG with similar abundance in natural resources suffer the  resources curse  and with the LNG project they are willing to help, she said.
 If not handled right it can end up making a country poorer, instead of richer.
 There are countries that started with the same hopes as PNG, with all the excitement that I know is in this country, because of the resources that were discovered but they weren't handled right,  she said.
Ms Clinton said she was positive PNG was heading in the right direction, especially with the US providing technical training for scientists and engineers and job training.
 We want to help you manage these new revenues wisely,  she said.
Ms Clinton also added that the resource industry also has a responsibility to tackling climate change.
 PNG represents both the promise and the peril, more energy resources but more threat from climate change,  she said.
Ms Clinton commended PNG's efforts to abate climate change and reduce deforest and reiterated a commitment to try and secure $US21 million ($A21.07 million) for Pacific Island nations, like PNG, to tackle climate change.
Empowering PNG women was another central theme of the visit.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"What's new? Woodside released its third-quarter production report last month but, before that, the bigger news event was the announcement of the resignation of chief executive Don Voelte.
Voelte has been the driving force of the company since his appointment in 2004, laying the foundations for Woodside's future in LNG (liquefied natural gas).
 When companies are defined by their key executives, resignations can alter the market's perception of the company's value and future prospects. Voelte's success at Woodside is based on the strategic direction in which he took the company in terms of developing its Australian gas assets. Once the direction was laid out, he then provided his executives with sufficient flexibility to pursue his goals as they deemed fit.
The result is that Voelte's exit from Woodside will not have any adverse effect on the company's forward momentum.
By the time he leaves mid-next year, Pluto will be in production and Pluto's expansion plans should be well advanced. Whoever steps in to replace Voelte will then be able to stamp their mark on Woodside by taking other projects such as Sunrise and Browse through to production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
The outlook
Management did not make any change to its full-year production guidance of 70 million to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE).
The investment case for Woodside is not so much based on its current production but its future production potential. The $12.3 billion Pluto project is at the vanguard of Woodside's LNG-fuelled future.
The initial production train was 94 per cent complete at the end of September. The project has been affected by industrial action, so it is difficult to say it is entirely on schedule.
Indeed, management is now conducting a periodic cost and schedule review of the Pluto project. This will be concluded and announced this month. A delay would seem likely, which would, in turn, push up the project's cost. Even so, we would not expect delays to extend much more than a quarter or so from the previous start-up target of next March.
The bigger issue for Pluto remains the source of gas for the project's expansion to a second production train and beyond. Woodside's exploration program has so far managed to turn up three dusters from six wells. Exploration activity will continue into next year but, as each quarter passes, it is looking increasingly likely the expansion will require third-party gas supplies.
Relying on third-party supplies would be less profitable than plugging into a company-owned resource. Subsequent production trains are, however, far less capital-intensive than the initial train, which includes the foundation infrastructure. Third-party gas is, therefore, a viable alternative and certainly preferable to waiting indefinitely for exploration success, which would drain Woodside's coffers instead of generating positive cash flow.
Price Woodside's stock price has trended down in a fairly volatile fashion so far this year. Momentum has, however, returned to the upside after the stock hit a low of $40.65 in August. The price is battling to break above the 39- and 200-week moving averages. Should Woodside manage to clear these resistance levels, we would expect to see a surge higher, possibly back through $50.
Worth buying? Voelte has done a tremendous job in establishing Woodside's growth potential. His continued presence at Woodside is not a prerequisite of the company achieving that potential and our positive view on the company remains unchanged.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Queensland's coal seam and liquefied natural gas (LNG) industries say they will need more than 9,000 workers for construction next year.
The Federal Government has approved two multi-billion-dollar LNG plants for Gladstone in central Queensland, with coal seam gas being piped from the Surat Basin.
 One of the proponents, UK-based BG Group, began construction this week.
The construction workforce prediction was outlined in a new workforce plan launched in Brisbane this morning.
Construction Skills Queensland (CSQ) is expecting workers to move from current projects in the state's south-east to areas including the Surat Basin and Curtis Island.
CSQ chief executive officer Schimming says the industries' early planning means there will not be a skills shortage.
 We think that because of this forward planning and we are ready to go now with programs, support and initiatives to help these companies build these gas plants,  he said.
 We can manage the flow of skills as and when required for the construction phase.
 They're workers who've already had experience in and across the construction industry.
 They'll be workers who have come from projects that are finishing up in the south-east corner and they'll move with construction firms into those jobs as and when those projects come online. 
Meanwhile, Anglicare says it expects to have to turn people away from its accommodation services as the LNG industry takes hold in the Gladstone region.
Anglicare central Queensland chief executive Philip Shade says climbing property prices will push many people out of the rental market.
 Once this comes in and the rents increase, that can force people out of the private rental market into the social housing rental market, which is already stretched beyond capacity,  he said.
 We are likely to see more people suffering from mortgage stress and rental stress and struggling to find accommodation. 
He says it is heartbreaking for Anglicare staff to be unable to help.
 We would love to be able to assist everybody who comes and knocks on our door and asks for our help,  he said.
 Often we can, but in this situation we cannot.
 We just don't have the housing stock available and unfortunately, it's like everything in life - demand outstrips supply and we're likely to see in the region increasing demand with a fairly static supply. 
He says the community should not rely on the Government to reduce the stresses.
 I suppose if you said, 'Philip can you have a dream', I would love our LNG partners to come and knock on my door and talk to me and say 'Philip, we'd like to put some money into more social housing and we'll tag it LNG social housing - we'd love to work with you',  he said.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"All eyes are now well and truly on the Western Downs, with British powerhouse BG Group committing $15 billion to its world-first Queensland Curtis Liquefied Natural Gas Project.
The announcement, made in Brisbane on Sunday, will see more than 5000 jobs open up across the Western Downs and towards Gladstone, as BG Group's wholly owned Australian subsidiary QGC constructs a 540 kilometre underground pipeline network to transport coal seam gas to a new LNG plant.
 The pipeline will carry coal seam gas from gasfields around Chinchilla to the plant in Gladstone where it will be exported to a number of countries including Chile, China, Japan and Singapore.
The first LNG exports from the plant are scheduled in 2014, when QGC anticipates 1000 ongoing jobs will be created as a result of the project.
â€œThis is a very significant milestone for the Australian economy,â€? Acting Prime Minister Wayne Swan said at the press conference in Brisbane with Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and BG executive vice-president Catherine Tanna.
Ms Tanna said the project would provide great benefit to the local area.
â€œCritically this project â€“ and the new industry it spawns â€“ will provide a sustainable future for many regional Queensland towns and communities which, without this sort of development, may continue to decline,â€? she said.
â€œWe expect about half of the project's total capital outlay over the next four years to be spent with Queensland and Australian firms and for about 80 per cent of operating expenditure over the next 20 years locally.
â€œProject benefits will include treatment of saline water produced with the gas for its re-use in local agriculture, towns and industry in the Surat Basin.â€?
Ms Tanna said the project would firmly cement QGC's position within the region.
â€œWe have a responsibility to maintain â€“ and to improve â€“ the jobs, industry and infrastructure we create because we have become more than just visitors,â€? she said.
â€œWe are determined to co-exist with our neighbours â€“ farmers, townspeople, miners, conservationists, traditional custodians, business and governments.â€?
Western Downs Council Mayor Ray Brown, also in Brisbane for the announcement, said the project offered a new future for the region.
â€œWe will be partnering with BG to deliver on promises of improved infrastructure such as roads and housing,â€? he said.
â€œThere are extremely interesting times ahead with a prospect of great wealth for the region.â€?
However, Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton said the project would put Queensland's environment at serious risk.
Mr Hutton said the Federal and State governments have imposed a large number of conditions on the project but they have allowed the project to go ahead without obliging the company to show how they will meet these conditions.
â€œBritish Gas has been given periods of time in which they are supposed to present accurate modelling of the Great Artesian Basin and they also have to show how they will minimise risk to our underground water systems,â€? he said.
â€œThe point is they don't know how to do these yet and so the Government is making an act of faith that they will work it out.
â€œDo you mean to tell me that, after the company has invested billions of dollars in this project and still can't get their environmental management plan right, that the Government will tell them to pull up stakes?
â€œIt's not going to happen.â€?
QGC said that work on the QCLNG project was expected to start this week.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"SUSTAINABILITY Minister Tony Burke sent ripples through myriad Queensland communities when he announced environmental approval for two resources projects.
He has pushed the go button for the liquefied natural gas projects planned by Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas, a joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total, and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG. Together they will entail investment of $20 billion and create 12,000 jobs.
 The annual combined production of LNG by the two projects will be equivalent to 90 per cent of current Australian LNG exports.
The economic effects will ripple throughout Queensland.
Coal-seam gas will be extracted from the Surat Basin west of Brisbane and piped to the coast for processing into LNG for export from the port of Gladstone. Each project will generate 5000 construction jobs and thousands more once production starts.
They are the first in a queue of mega-projects in what has been described as Queensland's gas rush.
Similar enterprises by Conoco Phillips of the US and Origin Energy are not far behind, and there are plans to pipe gas from South Australia's Cooper Basin to Gladstone. The Conoco venture is a $35bn undertaking.
These projects are massive in their impact. They will make Queensland a serious global player in the LNG export business.
The Queensland Resources Council says the two approved projects will pump out more LNG than the $43bn Gorgon Project in Western Australia.
Australia may eventually become the world leader supplying LNG.
Australia is the sixth-largest producer of LNG, but the two Queensland projects plus Gorgon will make it No 2 globally.
The main action will be in Gladstone, with massive LNG processing plants to be built and $3bn spent on larger port facilities. The source of the gas is the Surat Basin, and regional centres such as Toowoomba and Dalby are going to feel the economic impact.
So will communities between the Surat Basin and Gladstone, as rail links and gas pipelines are built.
It won't be all plain sailing for the proponents. Burke says both projects will have to meet tough standards, with 300 conditions applying to coal-seam gas extraction and further conditions relating to Gladstone harbour.
Gladstone Ports Corporation will have to comply with 50 strict environmental conditions for its western basin dredging project.
The projects will bring new industries to Gladstone and further its evolution as Queensland's industrial muscle town.
Acting Mayor Gail Sellers of Gladstone Regional Council says the region can expect population growth, rising business confidence and ongoing economic prosperity, but she acknowledges the projects will put heavy pressure on the city's infrastructure. Advantages for the city include employment opportunities and global and national investment inflows.
There will be disadvantages.
Local fishermen apparently will lose access to parts of Gladstone harbour and there are fears local employers will have trouble holding employees due to high wages in the resources projects.
The expected rise in house prices and rents will make it harder for locals not earning high wages in the resources sector. Newspaper reports suggest the approval announcement caused investors as far away as Western Australia to inquire about investment properties in Gladstone. The city's residential vacancy rate is below 1 per cent, according to sqmresearch.com.au, and projects of this magnitude will place serious pressure on housing supply.
Environmental concerns at Gladstone include the millions of tonnes dredged and dumped in Gladstone harbour and threats to a dugong sanctuary, dolphins, turtles, fisheries and other marine life.
There are concerns in the areas where the CSG will be extracted about contamination of groundwater and agricultural land. There are fears in the Western Downs region about the impact on local infrastructure as these huge projects invade areas accustomed to grazing cattle.
There are fears food production will be disrupted by networks of bores, pipelines, roads and rail tracks.
But government and business will focus on the new jobs, the investment inflows, the economic multiplier effect on businesses and the opportunities for development of new industrial, commercial and residential property.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"LNG By Kym Agius
BRISBANE, Nov 4 AAP - There are not enough skilled workers to support Queensland's coal seam gas industry's future, a new report says.
 Construction Skills Queensland (CSQ) and Energy Skills Queensland released a report on Thursday into the workforce needs of four coal seam gas projects.
The report says 9200 workers are needed to build the projects, and 18,000 staff will be needed for the long term.
The study found the industry will face significant competition for skilled labour from other mining projects within Australia and internationally.
The report says 40 occupations are in high demand, including welders, pipe fitters, construction workers, electrical and instrumentation.
It also identified low apprentice retention rates and the ageing workforce as major concerns.
Energy Skills Queensland spokesman Glenn Porter said the mining sector will try to lure workers out of regular construction jobs.
 The construction industry is still fairly flat in Queensland, we believe that there is some excess skills that could logically move over,  Mr Porter told AAP.
He said he's confident that they'll make up the numbers by the time construction peaks in 2013.
 There are some concerns, but there will be enough done to ensure the workforce is in place,  he said.
In March this year, the state government invested $10 million in an industry training fund to address the skills shortage.
CSQ also announced on Thursday $5 million for a similar project, as well as a workforce development program office based in Brisbane.
Mr Potter said 2000 people had registered their interest in working in the industry.
 They will be diverted into training,  he said.
Minister for Training Geoff Wilson said the government is working to support the industry.
 Developing a workforce to build the infrastructure needed for the emerging CSG/LNG sector involves the combined efforts of the energy and construction industries, government and training providers,  Mr Wilson said in a statement.
The report canvassed staffing levels for four projects in southeast Queensland by Shell, Origin, Santos and BG Group.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The $30 billion coal-seam gas industry has urged the federal government in high-level confidential discussions to change features of the proposed resource tax regime to avoid giving offshore competitors an unfair advantage.
The government plans to apply to the coal seam gas producers a tax similar to the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax, which now covers offshore oil and gas companies.
 Oil and gas producers Santos, BG Group, Origin and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association â€“ representing the industry â€“ met yesterday in Sydney with the Policy Transition Group to express their problems with the tax.
The Policy Transition Group is headed by Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and former BHP chairman Don Argus and includes senior officials from the Treasury and federal Resources Energy and Tourism department.
The coal seam gas producers argued that they are disadvantaged compared with their offshore counterparts.
Unlike conventional oil and gas projects, where the tax applies once the operations are profitable, the coal seam gas companies say they will be liable to pay state royalties from the moment they start production. The coal seam gas companies say this will create an uneven playing field between the two industries. These producers also say they have a different pattern of development that includes a longer trail of expenditure compared with offshore companies which face steep initial costs.
The industry is pushing for recognition of this as the group makes its final recommendations on the design of the tax. Among the concessions sought is increased deductibility for development costs.
The domestic gas industry is recommending the government introduce a $50 million threshold before the new tax cuts in, similar to that proposed for the minerals resource rent tax.
The industry has warned the government that the tax will result in higher domestic energy costs which will be passed on to consumers.
Electricity prices have risen by up to 40 per cent in some states over the past two years and steeper increases are expected in future.
Companies such as Fortesque Metals Group, Newmont, Verve Energy and Alcoa have argued through a submission to a Senate committee by Western Australia's Domestic Gas Alliance that the federal government should recognise the vital role played by domestic gas supply to Australia's economy and their fears the tax could reduce supply and raise prices.
A Senate committee inquiry examining new taxes including the mining tax will hold hearings ones including with Treasury secretary Ken Henry later this month.
But the coal seam gas industry is set to expand after the federal government gave conditional approval to $30 billion in planned gas projects in Queensland.
Environment Minister Tony Burke gave the projects the go-ahead pending environmental standards being met. The projects by BG Group and Santos are around Chinchilla, Gladstone and Curtis Island, in Queensland.
"
ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Santos says it is analysing the results of a study to see if water from coal seam gas plants can be used to 'top-up' a town's water supply in Queensland's southern inland.
Water strategies manager Shaun Davidge says the company wants to pump treated water from the plants into the aquifers that supply Roma.
 He says Santos is testing the theory on a smaller scale on a property at nearby Wallumbilla, east of Roma.
 The nation's, in fact the world's leading expert on managed aquifer recharge - that's the CSIRO - and they are doing a range of water quality, geochemistry, geochemical tests using the water from our treatment plants, mingling that with samples of the aquifer itself and working through a 14-point risk assessment,  he said.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"MARK COLVIN: The controversial coal seam gas industry took another step forward today with the opening of a new Queensland power plant fed by the gas. The plant on the Darling Downs is Australia's biggest to use combined gas and steam turbines. That creates better efficiency.
Environmentalists have welcomed further moves towards gas but they say concerns about extracting it from coal seams remain unresolved.
 Annie Guest reports from Brisbane.ANNIE GUEST: It has been a public relations roller-coaster for the coal seam gas industry lately - the lows of environmental concerns and a backlash from farmers, then the highs of major project approval and today, the opening of Origin's coal seam gas power plant on the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane.
The Premier Anna Bligh.
ANNA BLIGH: This power station is a significant step in Queensland's transition to a cleaner form of energy. So it's a great outcome for the environment but importantly it also increases reliable electricity supply.
ANNIE GUEST: The plant could power 400,000 homes. It's Australia's biggest combined cycle power station, using both gas and steam turbines. Origin's managing director Grant King says that makes the $780 million plant highly efficient.
GRANT KING: You can now put the gas fuel in and you run a turbine but you then take the waste heat from that turbine and use that waste heat to make steam and then that steam turbine also generates electricity and that lifts the efficiency of the power station from say 30 per cent to around 55 per cent so a much more efficient use of the fuel.
ANNIE GUEST: The gas that powers the plant is extracted from coal seams through hundreds of wells drilled in southern country Queensland. Coal seam gas is already sold to markets around Australia and has been mined for more than a decade.
But the industry is growing rapidly and many rural residents remain concerned about traces of cancer causing chemicals recently found in wells, the interruption to prime farmland, and the effect on the water table. However, Grant King is assuring people about his company's safety checks.
GRANT KING: We are comfortable that the activities of our industry will not cause any contamination to that water and the other issue of concern, of course, is that potentially the dewater in the coal seams could be what we call in communication with other aquifers and I'd say at this moment, to the best of our ability and our modelling, we don't believe that should be an issue but the industry will be monitoring that extremely closely.
ANNIE GUEST: But the executive director of the Conservation Council of Queensland, Toby Hutcheon, is sceptical.
TOBY HUTCHEON: The impacts upon the Darling Downs and on ground water, that's the real elephant in the room right now and that is we still haven't got assurances and guarantees that extracting CSG (coal seam gas) gas from the Darling Downs and from those 40,000-odd wells will actually not impact upon groundwater and farmland in those areas.
ANNIE GUEST: This power station is expected to use less than 3 per cent of the water and emit about half the greenhouse gases of a coal fired power plant. But environmentalists say commissioning new gas fired power stations is not enough. They want more coal fired stations decommissioned. And while work continues on carbon capture and storage technology it's so far unproven and uncommercial.
John Connor is from the research and lobby group, the Climate Institute.
JOHN CONNOR: Well this plant comes into what's really a very confused policy debate on direction on pollution and climate change and energy generally. From our perspective we see a role for gas but it's a role that's actually replacing coal fired power stations that need to be closed down and we need to make sure all new load energy comes from clean energy.
ANNIE GUEST: And what indications are there that this will replace coal fired power stations?
JOHN CONNOR: Well we'll only do that if we get a clear limit and a price on pollution and so that's why the discussions in Canberra with the multi-party Climate Change Committee are so important.
ANNIE GUEST: But closer to Brisbane, at Swanbank, a 30-year-old coal fired power station is scheduled to be decommissioned and replaced with gas in the next few years.
Meanwhile, the latest addition to Australia's national electricity network is not expected to lower prices for consumers. But it will help the Queensland Government fulfil its commitment to source 20 per cent of its electricity from gas by 2020.

NATALIE POYHONEN: While it's predicted construction and operation of the CSG LNG industry will deliver more than 10,000 jobs it will come with big challenges. Local Governments say booms put financial pressure on regional communities as housing and infrastructure costs soar and skills run short.
GREG HALLAM: There are lots of benefits. There's going to be a big boom of almost biblical proportions in areas that have never seen that sort of thing but we're going to see a very high spike in local prices, inflation running fairly strongly in those communities. We just have to put our thinking caps on and think through how we can manage the down sides of this boom.
NATALIE POYHONEN: He says regional centres are often a prime source of workers for the mining sector and local employers simply can't compete.
GREG HALLAM: The sorts of skills that councils have are people that have got plant tickets, people that work on the roads, people that have got technical or engineering backgrounds and even those in the offices those that do payrolls or human resource management or cost clerks they're all wanted in this new industry.
RAY BROWN, WESTERN DOWNS MAYOR: We can't afford to pay the cheque book allowances that these companies are making so our existing organisations in town that have contractors in either earth moving or supply chain networks will also lose staff because they can't afford to pay that either so there's a huge increase in the wage structure that comes across here.
(FOOTAGE OF COUNCIL MEETING)
NATALIE POYHONEN: Ray Brown is Mayor to 30,000 people in the Western Downs. The rise of the gas industry means more money and more people to the region. But he's concerned about the flow on effects.
RAY BROWN: When you start to lose key ambulance officers, paramedics when the police start to lose sergeants and constables to the energy sector you start to ask a few questions. Well how can we actually keep these professionally trained people? We have to replace them. The farming sector is a key one too because if they're taken off into the energy sector who's going to harvest our grains? Who's going to plant our crops?
NATALIE POYHONEN: Urban employers are concerned about the potential for pressure on their workforces too. Keith McIllwain manages a Brisbane based civil construction company.
KEITH McILLWAIN, GENERAL MANAGER, McILLWAIN CIVIL: There will be pressure on my work force to move into that area, there's always been a churn or a bleed into the energy and resources sector and we have to manage that. I think it's important that the existing work force is upskilled, that's certainly part of my work force planning is to ensure that the work force has a continuous learning process but also to encourage new entrants via apprenticeships and schools, doorways to construction programmes so that we open up the window to our industry.
(FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE PLAN LAUNCH MEETING)
NATALIE POYHONEN: The construction industry has moved to put programmes in place to meet the challenges ahead. This week in Brisbane it launched the 'Construction Workforce Plan' in collaboration with energy companies.
BRETT SCHIMMING CONSTRUCTION SKILLS QUEENSLAND: We need to work with those communities, work with those councils and work with small businesses and as I said we've got a team of people who are doing that; to map out and plan how we can also complement this industry because it's not about competing it's about working together and the beauty of the plan we've launched today is we've established what it will look like well in advance of that peak in 2013.
NATALIE POYHONEN: The report recommends training and employment strategies and 'workforce impact statements' to head off any unintended consequences of an increased labour force. The State Government's pledged to balance the needs of communities and companies too.
GEOFF WILSON, TRAINING MINISTER: We're meeting this challenge by putting strict conditions on the employers that firstly they need to focus on employing local people into the jobs that are available but secondly that they also must take account of the knock-on effect in the local community and provide the training and the opportunities for those other workers and to fill those other vacancies that are created.
NATALIE POYHONEN: The training Minister Geoff Wilson says this kind of planning is the key to ensuring everyone benefits from the boom.
GEOFF WILSON: We have an opportunity to do this well because it is a new industry, we are creating a new industry and it will take some years to do that but getting a good start is the best way forward.
NATALIE POYHONEN: And that's what communities like Dalby are hoping for.
RAY BROWN: When I go to the high schools now and address the kids there's talk about 'yeah I want to go and do this or I'll do engineering and commerce and something and I'll come back and I'll get a job in the energy sector. We didn't have that three years ago. Things have changed

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,4,"Dalby house prices not guaranteed
There are no guarantees that the real estate industry in Dalby will remain stable or affordable following the approval of the $15 billion Liquefied Natural Gas plant in Gladstone.
 Some community leaders are concerned for the local real estate industry looking to other boom mining towns in Queensland where both rental and house prices have soared. Member for Condamine Ray Hopper said he was concerned that the price of housing and accommodation may significantly rise.
â€œIt could perhaps become difficult for average Dalby families to afford any major increase in rental and house prices as we have seen in places like Mackay,â€? Mr Hopper said.
Mayor of Western Downs Regional Council Councillor Ray Brown said Dalby was insulated from the effects experienced in other towns, where a lack of supply resulted in unrealistic house and rent prices.
â€œWe have a ready supply of rental properties and properties for sale,â€? Cr Brown said.â€œIn areas where prices have soared, there has been no supply, which resulted in the high prices, which is not the case here.
â€œIf we make our towns liveable with all of the major essential services and infrastructure, the workers will want to live here and be a part of the community.
Local real estate agent, Richard Handley, Principal of Ray White Dalby said the main focus for a stable industry was to ensure any of the new workers don't just stay for three or six months than leave.
â€œWe want them to bring their families here and be part of the community and call Dalby home,â€? Mr Handley said.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,4,"Our say
The Queensland Curtis Liquefied Natural Gas project in Gladstone will be the first plant in the world to be run on coal seam gas.
 With BG Group announcing their $15 billion commitment to the LNG gas Dalby will feel enormous effects, in more ways than one.
Up to 5000 jobs across the Darling Downs and Gladstone area will be generated, with another 1000 up for grabs once exports begin in 2014.
The Surat Basin will be the source of the gas, meaning Dalby will be one of the main regional centre's that will feel the economic impact, as jobs open up on the construction of gas wells and the 380km pipeline to Gladstone.
These jobs will bring economic advantage to the region, but at what cost?
Set to produce 8.5 million tonnes of LNG a year, once the project is completed it will not only make Queensland a serious contender in the LNG export business but potentially put Australia in the forefront of the market, making it the second highest exporter in the world.
But with all economic advantages aside, environmentalists and farmers are demanding to know the ecological and environmental impacts this gas extraction will have, and rightly so.
But as a region, we need to ensure that all the checks and balances of this new and controversial form of mining are consistently carried out, and followed up.
There is just as much to lose as there is to gain. State and federal governments have assured those worried that tough standards and restrictions have been placed on the construction and development.
Some concerns raised include contamination to groundwater and agricultural land, and if so, the extent of these effects.
But it seems this is only the beginning for a region that is no stranger to change.
It is imperative that environmental impacts of this project be considered and carefully weighed too.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND'S coal seam gas boom is set to spark a surge in demand for Brisbane office space of up to 30,000sq m a year, according to a Jones Lang LaSalle report.
Its updated white paper - ``Where to Next for the Queensland Coal Seam Industry?'' - forecasts the CSG boom will indirectly impact across all sectors, providing significant stimulus to office space demand.
 Last week, the Federal Government gave environmental approval, under strict conditions, to British Gas and Santos to build their liquefied natural gas projects at Gladstone for a combined total of $30 billion, and there are others waiting in the wings.
It is expected that 18,000 new jobs will be created directly in the CSG-to-LNG sector over the coming decade and during this time there will also be another 18,000 new jobs created in the remaining mining sector.
The paper said this will flow through to increased growth prospects for white collar employment as demand increases for professional and business services - particularly in the finance and investment, insurance, business services and public administration sectors - to support the rapid growth in the resource sector.
Jones Lang LaSalle Queensland managing director Geoff McIntyre said most of this employment growth was expected to be located in the Brisbane CBD and fringe markets.
``We anticipate that an average of up to 30,000sq m of additional space could be generated each year over the next decade as production comes on stream, cumulatively creating demand of around 180,000sq m over the period to 2019,'' he said.
``This implies a long-term increase from the LNG investment cycle equivalent to around 6 per cent of the total current office stock in the combined Brisbane CBD and fringe markets.
``The bottom line is that even if the sector creates half the demand we estimate, it will have significant impacts on the Brisbane office market.''
Mr McIntyre said with the fringe being a relatively small market of 1.1 million sq m and with no space currently under construction in this market, a surge in demand could see vacancy tighten quickly beyond 2012 if there were no significant new projects.
``It should also be recognised that our demand estimates take into account space absorbed through the construction phase that will not be permanent, instead being taken up as project space,'' he said.
``As initial construction phases come to an end, many occupiers will pick up other work and roll staff on to new projects, although ultimately we consider that around a third to half of the space will eventually be given back to the market.''

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke is set to delay announcing the outcome of a strategic assessment of the impact of a proposed gas hub in the Kimberley, even though Woodside began geotechnicalâ€‚work at the proposed site yesterday.
Woodside's decision to start engineering and environmental studies of the Browse Liquefied Natural Gas Precinct has provoked anger from traditional owners of the James Price Point area. The company and the West Australian government are under fire from the Kimberley Land Council and the traditional owners after Premier Colin Barnett announced in September an intention to compulsorily acquire the land around the proposed site.
 The state government, Woodside and the KLC last year reached an in-principle agreement worth $1.6Â billion over the site, 60 kilometres north of Broome, but negotiations on a final agreement have been delayed by divisions within the native title claim group over whether or not the project should proceed.
A final investment decision by Woodside and its joint-venture partners is due by mid-2012.
Mr Barnett has indicated the project will not proceed if there is further delay.
But this week the Premier said he expected there would be an agreement with traditional owners over the Browse LNG Precinct despite the commencement of the issue of compulsory acquisition notices.
The proposed LNG site also requires a strategic environmental assessment, which is due for completion early this month.
However, it is understood that Mr Burke will delay any announcement to enable him time to visit the area.
A Woodside spokesman said yesterday the company had begun geotechnical work at James Price Point that day as part of its ongoing engineering and environmental studies of the Browse LNG Precinct.
 The study involves conducting cone penetrometer tests, which measure soil density,  the Woodside spokesman said.
 A cone penetrometer test involves spearing a probe into the soil to assess soil type and density.
 The studies program is important because it will provide technical information to contribute to the Browse LNG Precinct design and contribute to the assessment of any potential environmental impacts. 
The spokesman said Woodside had conducted Aboriginal heritage surveys of the area and had a heritage management plan in place should the study uncover any heritage sites.
But Anthony Watson, a member of the Jabirr Jabirr people who have a native title claim over the area, said the work showed the company was not dealing in good faith with Aboriginal people.
 We knew they had an intention to do this work but we did expect they would have come to us and consulted and got our approval before they went ahead with it,  Mr Watson said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"US filmmaker Josh Fox has a cautionary tale for the growing obsession with coal-seam gas.
Fox's documentary GasLand reports how lax environmental regulations have unleashed a modern-day goldrush across the US that has polluted underground water supplies and poisoned the air with a cocktail of toxic chemicals that companies have not been forced to disclose.
 There is footage of residents setting fire to water from their kitchen taps, and of drinking water supplies that turn to plastic when heated with a blowtorch.
GasLand has received widespread critical acclaim, including the Lennon Ono Grant for Peace, but sparked furious denials by big US gas corporations.
Fox arrives on Monday to promote the documentary's local release, aware of controversy over the rollout of coal-seam gas exploration and development in southeast Queensland and NSW.
Fox told The Weekend Australian his documentary contained many lessons for Australia, particularly in relation to the possible impacts of gas production on land use, air and water quality.
Rosemary Nankivell, who is leading a campaign against gas production on the Liverpool Plains in NSW, said there were particular concerns about the preservation of agricultural landand avoiding the contamination of ground water and lowering of the water table.
Coal-seam gas is a boom industry in southeast Queensland, where Environment Minister Tony Burke says he has imposed more than 300 strict conditions each on the Santos and Queensland Gas Company projects to help protect groundwater-dependent species and minimise other environmental impacts.
A spokesman for Mr Burke said that unlike in the US, the industry would be forced to disclose all of the individual chemicals used inthe process to liberate gas using a process known as hydraulic fracturing.
GasLand explains how 596 chemicals and millions of litres of water are used to recover gas from shale seams, posing a risk to the health of residents who live nearby.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"CONDITIONAL approval for the two coal seam methane-based liquefied natural gas export developments in Queensland makes it even more urgent for the Gillard government to respond to its own assessment of resource sector employment needs.
This is the view of Michael Roche, chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council.
 If the LNG projects are approved, he points out, the developers will need to find 10,000 construction phase workers and 2000 full-time operational positions.
The skills issue for the resources sector was underlined in October by job vacancy figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing the industry needed a record 6200 people in May, more than at any time during the boom of the past decade. Analysts say the report shows the industry has all but recovered from the uncertainty of 2008-09 thanks to improved economic activity in north Asia and strong demand for energy and mineral products from China and India.
The bureau says the industry's workforce reached 161,500 people in May, close to the record 163,800 achieved in November 2008, a recovery of 23,300 jobs in a year after the impact of the global financial crisis.
Roche says that, together, the proposed Santos and Queensland GLNG developments (at Gladstone) are bigger than the much-heralded Gorgon gas project in Western Australia.
The foreshadowed surge in workers required by the Gorgon joint venture was the trigger for the Rudd government setting up a taskforce into the national employment needs of the resources sector as a whole, chaired by Gary Gray, then a parliamentary secretary and now Special Minister of State.
The report by Gray's committee was delivered to the federal government before Julia Gillard called the election. It found that Australia would need to fill 45,000 construction phase jobs, mostly in the WA and Queensland export gas sectors, as well as 3200 operational jobs in LNG production. New mining developments would require an extra 61,500 workers by 2015.
It identified shortfalls in skills requirements of proposed resource developments of 36,000 tradespeople, 1700 engineers and 3000 geoscientists by the middle of this decade.
One of the challenges for resources companieswould be covering the departure of employees to other sectors along with retirements. This is expected to require 16,000 new workers in the next five years.
During the election, Roche says, both sides of politics ignored the Gray committee findings and how the resource sectors skills needs could be met. He argues resources companies need certainty and clarity on when, where and how the federal government proposes to lead and to engage with industry and other stakeholders to deliver a growing workforce.
The next federal election in 2013 will be too late to provide policy solutions to this problem.
A survey of Queensland Resources Council's member companies, including 77 in mining and energy production, during the election campaign revealed that skills shortages and associated workplace relations issues were high on the list of resource sector managers' concerns, along with rising input costs, infrastructure availability, problems in raising capital following the global financial crisis and regulatory uncertainty.

ASK Jean Bradley what she thinks about Gladstone's future and she answers with the wisdom of age, ``You can't stop progress''.
Mrs Bradley turned 90 on Wednesday and celebrated with a ferry trip from Gladstone to Curtis Island, until recent"
COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE best place to see the early impact of Gladstone's looming Liquefied Natural Gas boom is down at the Gladstone Marina.
It has become a breeding ground for vehicle ferries.
 The Moreton Venture, which used to run to Moreton Island, has relocated to Gladstone. So too, the big orange Seawind I, late of New Zealand. They join Curtis Ferry Services' existing two-ferry fleet.
The flotilla of smaller working vessels is also growing quickly. Among those leading the charge is Adam Balkin who, at just 26, is definitely one of the earlier beneficiaries of Gladstone's newest industry.
A trained coxswain, Mr Balkin launched his company AB Marine Services in 2008 mainly to support environmental companies and university research. But his timing could not have been worse; the global financial crisis struck within a month.
It ended up taking him three months to get the finance for his first boat, the 10m Harry John.
``In the meantime, another competitor brought a boat into the market and I missed a little bit of the market early on,'' he said.
But then the gas companies showed up, first in the form of men in suits but now as workers in high visibility vests.
``I've caught up now,'' Mr Balkin said.
Today, he owns four boats and manages another six and has a workforce of six, which he's going to have to add to soon. He's also about to buy his fifth boat, another 10m launch.
``It's going to be a big
jump, but it's a calculated risk,'' Mr Balkin said of his latest investment of about $200,000.
He's naturally happy about the new growth, but he says it will be important for the big companies to ``keep spending with the local businesses, to spread it around''.
He said the newcomers have so far ``been pretty good'' with the local service providers.
``All of them are very helpful, particularly on the safety side of things.''
And what about the future?
``Well, it's going to be interesting times for the next 10 years anyway,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"TEN years ago Anna Bligh and her Labor Government under Peter Beattie were told they would be mad to rely on coal seam gas as a power source.
But yesterday, Ms Bligh was able to flick the switch on Origin Energy's $1 billion new coal seam gas fired power station near Dalby, allowing the Premier to point to a new economic era for the once dying towns of the southwest.
 The station will power about 400,000 homes and produce about half the CO2 of a coal-fired equivalent. Ms Bligh said it won't be the last of it's type.
``What this means for the people of the southwest is that this is part of a transformation of their economy,'' Ms Bligh said.
``It's emerging as an energy powerhouse of the national market.''
``I expect more companies to make investment decisions like this one.''
The coal seam gas powering the station is also being used for several planned LNG projects at Gladstone and Ms Bligh yesterday announced Origin's own $35 billion LNG scheme would receive its state approvals imminently, adding it to the $15 billion scheme approved last week by Queensland Gas.
Despite farmers threatening to lock their gates and go to jail rather than allow CSG companies on their land, Ms Bligh said she believed the issues could be worked out.
``There are hurdles and legitimate concerns but I'm confident we can resolve them,'' she said.
The new 630 megawatt power station will meet about two years of demand growth in Queensland.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Approval of a $15 billion project has the city cooking with gas, writes Mark Ludlow.
It began as a trickle, but by the middle of next year almost 10,000 workers are expected to descend on the central Queensland city of Gladstone to help bring the burgeoning $50Â billion liquefied natural gas industry to life.
 Although there has already been preliminary drilling in the south-west gas fields 400 kilometres away, the business end of the LNG industry will start next year.
The approval of BG Group's $15 billion QCLNG project last week is expected to be the first of a handful of projects that will make the Port of Gladstone the export hub for the state's newest industry.
Gladstone may be derided as one of the dreary, mid-sized regional cities in the state, but it wears its label as an industrial city with pride. Standing on the main street, it is clear to see why it's embraced the LNG industry. To the west, the city's power station and its three huge power stacks tower over everything else. To the east is the port, where coal berths load the state's most famous export from the Bowen Basin. To the south is Queensland Alumina's refinery, with its piles of red mud â€“ the waste from the conversion process that turns bauxite into alumina.
Just off the mainland, in the northern section of the harbour, is Curtis Island.
The south-west tip of the island, which is mostly national park, will be home to the processing plants for the LNG industry.
It will be here where the coal seam gas will be piped, and then frozen at -162 degrees celsius and transported to customers throughout Asia.
Of the 10,000 workers, including engineers, construction workers and drillers, expected to build the pipeline and processing plants, a few thousand are expected to live in construction camps on Curtis Island.
QCLNG's project alone will use 5000 workers during construction, of whom 3000 are expected to be in Gladstone and half of them on Curtis Island. Locals will be ferried to the island, while the rest will be in construction camps â€“ or accommodation villages as they are being spruiked.
The good news for potential workers is it will be a  wet  camp (alcohol will be allowed) and the company is looking at measures to  manage mosquitoes and biting insects , according to the environmental impact statement.
Gladstone Ports Corporation chief executive Leo Zussino, who is overseeing the dredging of the harbour to accommodate the new LNG industry, says surveys show 87 per cent of locals support the impending invasion of LNG workers.
 The fact is Gladstone over the next two years is going to be the powerhouse of the eastern seaboard,  he says.  There's nothing compared with what's going on here.
 By April next year we're going to be a very busy little place, especially if Santos's project gets going, as well as Wiggins Island Coal Terminal. 
A recent report by the industry body Energy Skills Queensland predicts 9200 workers will be needed to build the LNG projects and 18,000 will be needed over the longer term.
There are hopes many locals who now fly in and out of Western Australia will return.  We're definitely hoping some of these highly skilled workers will come home,  says ESQ chief executive Glenn Porter.  We're not expecting skills shortages because we have been planning for this for a while. 
And unlike coal workers, who are forced to travel out west and live in  dongas  in small towns such as Nebo, Moranbah and Dysart, at least Gladstone is on the coast and only a short drive from surf beaches. While there may be a lack of after-work activities in Gladstone, a town with only a handful of pubs for entertainment - Zussino reckons locals have other things on their minds.
 We are just country boys. But the problem is we have too much bloody work to do, which is why we're working after dark,  he laughs.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A National action group formed in the Hunter Valley at the weekend says its first priority is to seek a moratorium on new coal seam gas and coal mining developments.
Representatives from Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales met in the township of Broke where the local community's fighting a gas exploration project.
 AGL Energy currently has 10 test wells in the area.
Hunter Valley Protection Alliance spokesman John Thompson says those attending the meeting expressed similar concerns about the threat to water supplies, agriculture and their lifestyles.
 We have actually nominated our initial committee, representatives from the states,  he said.
 That committee is charged with building the action strategy that we will exercise over the next several months to press the case so that the broader public becomes aware but to make the Governments aware that this is not going away, its not something they can sweep under the carpet.  
Mr Thompson says the alliance will target Federal and State politicians.
 This is rising from individual communities desperately fighting their causes and trying to get the politicians to pay attention,  he said.
 All these communities will continue to fight their individual causes but we will roll that up into a National movement where all these communities are coming together and saying that this isn't an issue for one or two or three communities, this is a National issue.

The Gladstone region's population is expected to jump from 60,000 to more than 100,000 over the next 20 years.
 Councillor Craig Butler says roads will need to be upgraded to cope with an increase in industrial traffic and satellite towns should be considered in infrastructure planning.
 The population projections show that both Calliope and the Boyne-Tannum areas are projected to grow more quickly than the Gladstone city area,  he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The next few months will be critical in determining whether the long-awaited consolidation of the Queensland liquefied natural gas sector will take place, as rival ventures assess their multibillion- dollar investment decisions, according to Origin Energy managing director Grant King.
While stopping short of predicting that deals will be done, Mr King said companies involved in the LNG sector will no doubt rationally examine opportunities over the coming period before they get too locked into their individual projectsplans.
 Even after final investment decisions have been made, scope still exists for some consolidationfor a short while, Mr King told The Australian Financial Review. In any case, The total number of LNG trains for which the ventures are seeking development approval on Curtis Island is  probably more than the capacity that will be built , he said, foreshadowing more intense discussions on possible deals over the next few months.
Origin's own $35 billion coal seam gas-based LNG venture with ConocoPhillips, Australia Pacific LNG, has been targeting a final investment decision for an initial two-train project at the end of 2010 but has yet to announce any sales contracts with customers, raising doubts in the market as to whether the timetable will be met. British rival BG gave the go-ahead for its $US15 billion-plus Queensland Curtis LNG venture in Gladstone a week ago, while Santos's FID on its GLNG project is due later this year.
A fourth project by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina is following a later timetable, targeting a go-ahead in 2012 or 2013. All three ventures have some or all of their LNG offtake already committed, while BG chief executive Frank Chapman said last week that BG is already marketing LNG from a possible expansion project.
Between them, the four world-scale CSG-LNG ventures are seeking development approval for up to 15 LNG production trains on Curtis Island in Gladstone, representing a huge volume of capacity compared with the six trains currently in production across the whole country.
 The industry will permit more capacity in aggregate than it's likely to use, and that will be something that I'm sure people will contemplate as they think about any discussions they might have around consolidation, but it won't be the only factor,  Mr King said.
The ambitious growth plans are sparking mounting concerns about shortages of skilled labour and constraints on construction and engineering services that will spread beyond the gas sector to other parts of the economy.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"ARROW BRISBANE, Nov 9 AAP - Arrow Energy says cancer-causing chemicals have been found in three of its coal seam gas wells in central Queensland.
Routine tests at the Moranbah gas project, west of Mackay, have detected traces of benzene in three of 60 fluid samples taken, the company said.
 Arrow has ordered independent tests to verify the results but says it's unlikely the chemicals have spread to water bores.
 There is no registered water bores within five kilometres of the three wells,  the company said in a statement.
The company said it would test bores closest to the area as a precaution and had notified the state government and local councils about the chemical find.
Benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene (BTEX) can be naturally occurring and can also be found in a range of oil-based products including lubricating oil, diesel and petrol.
It is used by some companies in the coal seam gas industry to help fracture rock seams and to extract gas, but that process may soon be outlawed in Queensland.
The government on October 5 proposed new laws banning the use of BTEX in the hydraulic fracturing process. The legislation is currently before parliament.
Arrow insists it does not use BTEX in it the fraccing fluids (which are pumped into a well under high pressure).
 More research will be conducted to determine if the benzene is naturally occurring, or introduced by other means,  the company said.
The scare comes just three weeks after BTEX was found in bore water at Australia Pacific LNG's coal seam gas project in the Surat Basin, in southwest Queensland.
The chemicals were later found to be at safe levels.
And in mid-July, the Queensland government suspended Cougar Energy's underground coal gasification project near Kingaroy, in the state's southeast, after underground water was contaminated with benzene and toluene.

BRISBANE, Nov 9 AAP - The Queensland government has granted conditional approval for a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project that could reap $15 billion for the state in its first five years.
 Australia Pacific LNG has been granted approval, subject to 600 conditions, to progressively develop a gas field between Injune and Millmerran over 30 years.
A 450km transmission pipeline to Gladstone and an LNG facility on Curtis Island will also be built.
Premier Anna Bligh made the announcement on Tuesday but said the joint venture between Origin and ConocoPhillips would still need to demonstrate it could meet strict environmental requirements.
 The company must prepare a coal seam gas water-management plan and a ground-water monitoring strategy before it will get its final environmental tick,  Ms Bligh told reporters.
 So it's approval - subject to them proving up that technology as they develop the resource. 
She said the industry was an important one, giving Queensland a new export industry but the environmental risks had to be properly managed.
Social conditions also attached include the construction of hundreds of houses in Gladstone and in the southwest and Western Downs areas.
The project will still need federal government approval before it can go ahead.
Ms Bligh said there was no reason why that approval should not be granted and the project could start construction in 2011.
 This is a massive project,  she said.
 It is a project that will bring 6000 jobs to Gladstone, central Queensland and the southwest of our state.
 It represents up to $35 billion of investment in coming years. 
Australia Pacific LNG project director Page Maxson said two trains (processing facilities) were planned for the first five years, with an investment pricetag of around $15 billion.
And there were plans to operate four trains in the future, which would push investment into the Queensland economy to $35 billion, he said.
The industry has come under scrutiny recently with cancer causing chemicals found in gas wells in two projects, including Australia Pacific's LNG's coal seam gas project in the Surat Basin.
The chemicals were later found to be at safe levels but the source has not yet been located.
On Monday, Arrow Energy found benzene in three of its coal seam gas wells in central Queensland.

BRISBANE, Nov 9 AAP - Premier Anna Bligh has defended environmental safeguards for gas projects after a carcinogen was found in three coal seam gas wells in central Queensland.
 Routine tests at Arrow Energy's Moranbah gas project, west of Mackay, have detected traces of benzene in three of 60 fluid samples taken, the company said on Tuesday.
Arrow has ordered independent tests to verify the results but said it was unlikely the chemical had spread to water bores.
 There is no registered water bores within five kilometres of the three wells,  the company said in a statement.
Arrow will test bores closest to the area as a precaution and has notified the state government and local councils about the chemical find.
Work on the project has not been suspended, the company said.
Benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene (BTEX) can be naturally occurring and can be found in a range of oil-based products including lubricating oil, diesel and petrol.
Arrow's vice president of exploration Tony Knight said the company would find alternatives if BTEX compounds were found in any of the grease or lubricant products it used.
He said independent test results were due within two weeks and described the levels of benzene detected in the three samples as  minute , at two parts per billion.
The scare comes just three weeks after BTEX compounds were found in bore water at Australia Pacific LNG's coal seam gas project in the Surat Basin, in southwest Queensland.
The chemicals were later found to be at safe levels.
And in mid-July, the Queensland government suspended Cougar Energy's underground coal gasification project near Kingaroy, in the state's southeast, after underground water was contaminated with benzene and toluene.
The premier on Tuesday said there was no evidence of any environmental harm or impacts on ground water or landholder bores on or near the Arrow site.
She said the fact the company had notified authorities of the test results showed environmental safeguards were working.
 The fact that Arrow Energy has reported traces of this chemical is a testament to the rigour of our environmental monitoring process,  she told reporters.
Ms Bligh said there were always risks to the environment and to workers in new industries.
 And what we do is put in place strict regimes and regulations that manage those risks so that we can see the economy move forward,  she said.
 ... I think we need to manage these risks but if we walk away from an industry that offers Queensland and our regional areas the best prospect of growth and prosperity that they've seen for decades, then we will be, in my view, reneging in our responsibilities. 
She said any company that failed environmental conditions would not be allowed to operate.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) said there were escalating concerns about water contamination from mining activities, including coal seam gas projects.
 We believe that federally, this is becoming a national issue that needs to be investigated far more than is currently the case,  the NFF's Denita Wawn told AAP.
She said safeguarding the health of ground water supplies and the nation's aquifers was paramount.
 We don't believe there's significant science to date that actually ensures we're not having a detrimental impact on our groundwater in this country, with coal seam (gas) and mining generally. 
She urged governments to ensure mining companies were subject to external monitoring regimes, alongside self-monitoring requirements.

Another consortium, Australia Pacific, has been given conditional approval to pipe coal seam gas to Gladstone in central Queensland, the third in recent weeks.
 Friends of the Earth spokeswoman Kristy Walters says the State Government should slow down.
 It's crazy, there should be a moratorium placed on any further coal seam gas projects so that we can actually understand what the environmental impacts are,  she said.
 They're going about it the wrong way.
 They're saying we'll just give approval to these projects without fully understanding what the environmental impacts are, let alone the health impacts. 
Rural advocates have joined environmentalists in calling for a pause in new gas projects in Queensland.
They are worried about chemical damage to the Great Artesian Basin.
AgForce spokesman Wayne Newton says it will be hard to stop the industry when it hits full speed.
 We've got actually grave concerns about the speed of development,  he said.
 There's sort of a gold rush mentality about the whole industry at the moment.
 We're seeing increasingly issues being raised that neither the Government nor the coal seam gas industry itself can answer. 
However, backers of the latest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to get the go-ahead say the community can be confident about environmental standards.
Australia Pacific spokesman Page Maxson says there are 600 environmental conditions.

 We've called for more science into the impacts, particularly on our underground water ... we haven't got that yet and I don't believe we've got the confidence of the general public as well as the farming community on this issue. 
The latest project to get state approval would take coal seam gas from the Walloon fields, which stretch from Injune to Millmerran, and take it along a 450-kilometre underground pipe to Curtis Island off Gladstone, where it'll be cooled, compressed and then exported.
The Origin Energy/ConocoPhillips joint venture is the third project of this nature to reach a level of regulatory approval, although only one, put forward by BG Group, has had capital committed to it.
The development that will be needed at Curtis Island to accommodate the processing facilities and shipping is worrying the environmental group WWF.
 The approval today may have gone through the EIS process but it's not an isolated development, this is the third cab off the rank,  said WWF marine species manager Lydia Gibson.
 We are deeply concerned that it's death by a thousand cuts for some of the threatened marine wildlife. 
She says a massive amount of dredging will occur and that will destroy breeding and feeding grounds imporant for turtles, dugongs and Australia's only native dolphin, the snubfin dolphin.

 There's growing world demand for gas, which is cleaner than coal and cheaper than oil.
But the sudden expansion of coal seam gas extraction in Queensland has pitted mining companies against farming communities, which are concerned about the impact this mining activity could have on underground aquifers.
There's been similar concerns in the US, which were recently documented in the prize-winning film Gasland, shown for the first time to an Australian audience in Brisbane last night.
Peter McCutcheon reports.

PETER MCCUTCHEON: What some see as a groundbreaking expose, the gas and petroleum industry see as thinly disguised propaganda.
ROSS DUNN, AUSTRALIAN PETROLEUM PRODUCERS AND EXPLORATION ASSOCIATION (APPEA): It lacks the hard evidence based research that you need to qualify for a documentary.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: And the controversy has come to Australia, with the launch of the documentary Gasland in Brisbane.
The film is being shown at a critical time, with the recent approval of coal seam gas projects in Queensland, and a concerted campaign from environmentalists and farming groups to halt the industry's expansion.
JOSH FOX: There has been a steady stream of emails and Facebook entreaties and people screaming 'Please bring the film here! We're suffering, we're in trouble!'
WAYNE NEWTON, AGFORCE: As we've seen in the US experience, this seeking of dollars, this absolute necessity to raise money by state treasuries will sometimes over-ride good environmental practice.

PETER MCCUTCHEON: Gasland tells the story of how the Bush administration's deregulation of environmental laws in 2005 led to a rapid expansion of shale gas drilling across the United States.
And the result has been wide-spread pollution of water supplies in many rural communities.

PETER MCCUTCHEON: Josh Fox blames a drilling process known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking.
JOSH FOX (from Gasland): It blasts a mixture of water and chemicals 8,000 feet into the ground. The fracking itself is like a mini-earth quake. The intense pressure breaks apart the rock and frees up the gas.
(Big boom)
ROSS DUNN: It's important to know that it has absolutely no relevance to the production and regulation of coal seam gas in Australia.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: Ross Dunn is a spokesman for the industry body the Australian Petroleum Producers and Exploration Association.
He says the natural gas industry in Australia is very different to that of the US.
The gas extracted from the coal seam, not shale, fracking is not used as widely and the industry is subject to some of the toughest environmental conditions in the world.
ROSS DUNN: In Australia the industry is very transparent. We have a a lot of government regulation, a lot of environmental regulation. We have many processes which show that the industry is operating sustainably.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: Indeed, strict environmental conditions forced the shutting down of a pilot project earlier this year to produce gas under the ground by setting coal seams on fire.
This process - known as underground coal gasifiction - was believed repsonsible for the leaking of benzene into ground bores near Kingaroy.
STEPHEN ROBERTSON, QUEENSLAND MINES AND ENERGY MINISTER (August 2010): If this technology cannot be operated safely, then it has no future in Queensland.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: But another coal technology - extracting gas from the coal seam - has passed a number of environmental hurdles.
Last month the Federal Government approved two coal seams gas projects in Queensland, and Britain's BG groups announced it would expanding coal seam gas operations and build a 540 kilometre pipeline from the Surat Basin to the port of Gladstone.
CATHERINE TANNA, BG GROUP (October 31): We estimate that the project will increase economic activity in Queensland by 32 billion Australian dollars.
MARTIN FERGUSON, RESOURCES MINISTER (October 31): It is a new industry for Australia in terms of export opportunities. It is a first.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: And today the Queensland Premier announced a joint venture between Origin Energy and Conoco Philips had met the state's environmental conditions.
ANNA BLIGH, QUEENSLAND PREMIER: And with our third company now into the approval phase, this new industry is really gaining momentum.
(Calf moos)
PETER MCCUTCHEON: But many farmers whose land lies on top of these gas reserves are unimpressed.
The extraction of gas from the coal seam brings with it left-over salty water - and there concerns about the long term effect is will have on the Great Artesian Basin.
There has also been several cases of toxic hydrocarbons found in coal seam gas wells - although these ponds were isolated from aquifers and water streams.
WAYNE NEWTOWN: We have a whole new industry that is going to enter the scene and be allowed to extract a huge amount of water - could be up to 350,000 megalitres a year - from the Great Artesian Basin. And they just have open licence to do this.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: Wayne Newton is a grain grower on Queensland's Darling Downs and the grains spokesman for Queensland's peak agriculture lobby group Agforce.
He's seen the Gasland documentary, and believes it has some relevance to an Australian audience.
WAYNE NEWTOWN: I think the real point of similarity is the conflict of interest that occurs within government.
These governments have huge conflicts with them being the single largest beneficiary of the revenue that's going to come from this industry.
ROSS DUNN: There is no other industry- I don't think any other industry in Australia is regulated to the extent that the coal seam gas industry is regulated.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: It was a sell out session for the documentary's Australian premier and the follow up Q and A session was sympathetic to the filmmaker.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can the film tour regionally? Becuase I know Palace doesn't have distribution areas in the West. Can you take the film out so people...
JOSH FOX: I think it's happening.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: In fact Josh Fox says he'll be taking his camera with him.
(to Josh Fox) So will we see Gasland Australia ?
JOSH FOX: I think so. I think so. I mean at least a segment of the next part of this, whether that's a full length feature film which is a sequel, or it's a shorter follow up. Yeah, absolutely.
PETER MCCUTCHEON: The are nearly 4,000 coal seam gas wells across rural Queensland at the moment. With the potential for this to increase nearly tenfold, the industry acknowledges it needs to do more work to bring rural communities on board.
(to Ross Dunn) Who do think is winning the PR at the moment?
ROSS DUNN: Well the industry... the industry has a lot of work to do and we know that.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"ARROW Energy has found traces of dangerous chemicals in three of its Queensland coal seam gas wells.
The company, owned by multinational energy giant Shell, advised various government departments and landowners of its discovery yesterday afternoon.
 It comes only three weeks after the state's emerging liquefied natural gas industry was rocked by news that cancer-causing agents - benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, or BTEX - were detected in eight Origin Energy exploration wells.
Subsequent analysis of samples, taken from water bores at Miles, 300km west of Brisbane, had not identified unsafe levels of any of the chemicals, Origin said.
Preliminary results from Arrow's monitoring tests detected minute traces of benzene in three of 60 fluid samples taken from three wells in the northern Bowen Basin in Central Queensland.
As a precaution, Arrow will now test water from bores close to the wells but said there were no registered water bores within 5km of the affected wells and that coal seam water was not used for feedstock.
Other independent testing will be done to determine if the benzene it found was naturally occurring or introduced by another means.
Arrow claimed it had not used chemicals containing BTEX in the liquids used to fracture its coal seams.
Shell and Origin are two of the four players racing to develop an LNG hub at Gladstone, feeding off Queensland's vast coal seam gas reserves.
But they are running into headwinds from community groups concerned about the environmental impacts of the projects.
Farmers at Felton have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience against Ambre Energy's $3.5 billion mining proposal, although the unrest has not held back the industry.
BG Group has now given financial approval for its $15 billion LNG project, while mining magnate Gina Rinehart began work on her $6.7 billion coal mine at Alpha yesterday.
Ms Rinehart's company, Hancock Coal, has started a trial to test the suitability of the coal and will make a final decision on the project, including a 480km rail line, next year.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"$3.3bn surprise selldown ; Trigger for oil and gas shakeup
Royal Dutch Shell is willing to sell its remaining interest in Woodside Petroleum after offloading a $3.3 billion stake in the operator of the North-West Shelf Â­liquefied natural gas project.
 Australia's largest independent oil and gas producer has been put into play after Shell took advantage of the recent rally in Woodside shares and the strong Australian dollar to sell a 10 per cent stake in the company. Shell cut its holding to 24 per cent in the largest block sale of shares to date, eclipsing the Future Fund's $2.4 billion selldown of Â­Telstra last year.
Shell had harboured ambitions to acquire Woodside but its $10 billion takeover bid in 2001 was rejected by then treasurer Peter Costello on national interest concerns.
But Shell's willingness to consider  bona fide takeover  offers in effect opens the way for a bid which may test Labor's view on ownership of Woodside and its prized oil and gas assets.
BHP Billiton has been a longÂ­rumoured suitor for Woodside and could be in a position to move following the blocking of its $US40 billion bid for Potash Corp of Saskatchewan by Canadian authorities last week.
BHP is believed to have previously been attracted to the Woodside business, but has been historically deterred by Shell's controlling stake in the company.
The sale could lead to a major overhang in Woodside stock, given Shell's preparedness to sell at $42.23 a share, an 8 per cent discount to Woodside's closing price of $45.86.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the Shell selldown was overall a positive for Woodside, as it was a  clear signal  that Shell was ultimately a seller of its remaining stake.
 We have always seen Shell's 34.3 per cent stake in Woodside as a deterrent to any corporate interest in Woodside as a takeÂ­over bid for the company would effectively require Shell's agreement to achieve,  Mr Hirjee said.
He said BHP, the UK's BG Group and other international oil companies were likely to be interested in Woodside.
Shell said in a statement that while Woodside had been an important part of its Australian portfolio, it planned to increasingly manage its Australian investments directly.
Shell said it would escrow its remaining Woodside shares for one year, but would sell stakes of 3 per cent or more to  strategic  third parties that agree to abide by the same restrictions. It also said it could sell its stake earlier to  a bona fide takeover offer for Woodside .
Shell, which used UBS to manage the sale and Rothschilds as its independent adviser, is believed to have long been eyeing an exit from Woodside.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said the sale was consistent with Shell's global strategy to simplify the company's structure.
 Now we know the answer we have all been asking for ages, which is, is Shell a seller? And the answer is yes,  she said.
 I think they made it quite clear . . . that unfortunately Woodside has become less relevant for Shell. 
Shell earlier this year acquired coal-seam gas company Arrow Energy in partnership with Â­PetroChina, with the companies planning to process Arrow's gas through an LNG facility near Gladstone in Queensland.
The company is also building a revolutionary floating LNG vessel to develop the Prelude gas field off northern WA, and has a stake in the Gorgon LNG project being built in north-west WA.
Shell acquired its Woodside stake as part of its blocked $10 billion takeover offer in 2001. The offer, which was pitched at $14.80 a share, was rejected by Mr Costello over concerns that Shell's other gas projects in the region may have undermined the priority given to the development of the North-West Shelf.
Shell has since had representation on the Woodside board, and while the firms have had differences of opinions over the Browse joint venture off northern WA, relations between them are believed to be harmonious.
Woodside is the operator of the North-West Shelf LNG project, which has been dubbed the largest resources project in Australia. Woodside, Shell, BHP, BP, Chevron and Japan Australia LNG each hold 16.7 per cent stakes in the project, which contributes 1 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product and spins off more than $1 billion a year in government royalties.
The Shell sale comes at a particularly tumultuous time in Woodside's history. Chief executive Don Voelte last month said he would retire in the coming year, while Woodside's hard-nosed but highly respected chief financial officer, Mark Chatterji, is heading back to the United States at the end of the year.
At an operational level, the $13 billion first stage of Woodside's key growth item, the Pluto liquefied natural gas project near Karratha, is expected to result in its schedule and budget blowing out for a second time.
Plans to double Pluto's capacity have been hindered by Woodside's inability to find sufficient gas, while its next two growth projects, Browse and the Sunrise LNG project in the Timor Sea, each face key hurdles.
Browse has long been mired by disunity among Woodside and its joint venture partners, which include both BHP and Shell, over how to develop the project. The federal government late last year ordered the partners to work towards Woodside's preferred option of a stand-alone LNG plant at James Price Point, north of Broome, but some Aboriginal groups have objected.
Sunrise, meanwhile, is surrounded by even more uncertainty with the East Timor government refusing to endorse Woodside's plans to exploit the field, which sits in joint Australian and East Timorese waters, via a floating LNG vessel.
Pengana Capital portfolio manager Tim Schroeders was more reserved about the possibility of an approach from BHP.
 I've always been less than optimistic about the prospects of [Woodside] being knocked off, and I don't think that's going to change a lot. I believe the regulatory hurdles are greater than most people think,  he said
 I'd put little probability on BHP stepping up, for instance. Plenty of people believe it and I'm sure BHP would like more of the North-West Shelf, don't get me wrong, but I don't think Woodside is a have-to-have, and the rest of the asset base is more problematic than the North-West Shelf.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Queensland's $50 billion coal seam gas industry has been rocked for the second time in three weeks after cancer-causing chemicals were detected at Arrow Energy's coal seam gas wells.
Arrow Energy, a venture between Shell and PetroChina, said yesterday it had detected traces of the cancer-causing agent benzene in samples taken from its Moranbah coal seam gas project in the Bowen Basin in central Queensland.
 Arrow's announcement follows a similar revelation by Origin Energy in October. Origin halted exploration drilling at one of its projects near Miles, 300 kilometres west of Brisbane, after cancer-causing agents known as BTEX were detected in Â­surface water during routine testing.
Arrow has advised the government and landholders that monitoring tests detected minute traces of benzene in three of 60 fluid samples taken in the northern Bowen Basin.
The preliminary results relate to two wells in the area of Moranbah and one well in an adjoining exploration tenement. While there are no registered water bores within five kilometres of the three wells, Arrow will test water from bores closest to the area as a precaution.
The company has briefed local environmental departments and its Moranbah joint venture partner, AGL Energy. BTEX is an acronym for the group of chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene.

* Total enterprise value

Is the smart money getting out of Woodside Petroleum? There are few stocks that divide opinions in the market more than the Perth-based liquefied natural gas group.
 Woodside's detractors argue the stock is overpriced, running on the hope of a BHP Billiton takeover and the assumption that its hyped Pluto project and others perform exactly to plan.
On the other hand, its supporters reckon there's no better exposure to LNG growth, especially in the Asian region.
Royal Dutch Shell's move yesterday to pare its holding suggests it agrees with the Woodside bears.
After hanging around on the register for years, Shell looked opportunistic yesterday in its decision to flog 78.34 million shares at $42.23 â€“ representing almost 30 per cent of its stake â€“ at a steepish 7.9 per cent discount to the last close.
The Woodside share price has rallied to its highest point since May, helped by renewed market speculation that BHP will turn to the gas group after the Canadians rejected its bid for PotashCorp.
That the Australian dollar is at a record high makes the case for a Shell sale even more attractive.
Throw in the fact that Shell also has other LNG options now â€“ including Gladstone, which is awaiting the final investment decision before Santos hits the button on a substantial equity raising â€“ and there's no reason for the group to delay trimming its shareholding.
And that's before even getting into the issues surrounding Woodside's Sunrise project (Timor is upset that the gas won't be processed onshore) or Browse (which is still running into difficulty with traditional landowners).
Shell's statement late yesterday made it very clear the company had turned its focus elsewhere and that it was a seller of its remaining stake â€“ even with the rump of its holding in escrow for the next 12 months.
It also appears to have given up hope of converting its shares into holdings at the asset level.
As for why it didn't offload more stock yesterday through UBS, it's unlikely more could have been sold in this market without a punitive discount.
As it is, the $3.3 billion line of stock was the largest block trade executed in this market, ahead of the Future Fund's sell-down on Telstra last year.
However, Shell's decision to sell stock to institutional investors is interesting in itself.
Presumably if the option had been there to sell to a strategic buyer like a BHP Billiton or an offshore player, it would have been considered.
Arguably, the stock remains too expensive for BHP at the moment.
On total enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Woodside's implied value is above most of its international peers, with the exception of BP (see graphic).
Valuation aside, BHP has also had its hands full with PotashCorp, and before that Rio Tinto. Quite possibly, BHP will eventually turn back to Woodside, but clearly, it's not ready to do that quite yet.
Offshore strategic buyers are thin on the ground as well. It is considered unlikely that the government will wave through any acquisition by a foreign owner â€“ particularly a nationalised one â€“ which limits that option as well.
Shell isn't the only party not hanging out for a strategic buyer or project completion.
About two months ago, outgoing chief Don Voelte sold 10Â per cent of his holding.
At the time, the company said proceeds of the sale would manage tax liabilities arising from the vesting of stock.
That is undoubtedly true, but it still isn't a great look, particularly now Shell has followed suit.
For Woodside chairman Michael Chaney, who is still facing some shareholders who remain unhappy about how Woodside went about its capital raising last year after so firmly playing down the prospect, it's going to be an interesting challenge to make sure this company delivers on the projects.
The next 12 to 18 months is crunch time for Woodside.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"GAS SYDNEY, Nov 10 AAP - NSW Greens upper house MP Cate Faehrmann has called for a moratorium on coal seam gas exploration in the state at a protest against the industry in Sydney.
Ms Faehrmann's call comes after a contamination scare on Tuesday in which a cancer-causing agent was found in three coal seam gas wells in central Queensland.
  I have been overwhelmed by the amount of communities that are going to be affected by mining proposals on the books right now,  she told protesters gathered outside the NSW State library on Wednesday.
 (We need) a full and immediate moratorium on this industry until we know the full social, environmental and economic impact of this industry. 
More than 60 protesters gathered outside the library on Macquarie Street, waving banners reading  No fracking (sic) way  and chanting slogans as other speeches were made by NSW Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon and environmentalist Jack Mundey.
The technique used by some gas companies known as  fraccing , or hydraulic fracturing, forces gas to the surface for use as energy.
But environmental groups are concerned about the potential for the process to allow toxic rock to contaminate water supplies.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"ENERGY PERTH, Nov 10 AAP - Australia is poised to overtake Norway to become the third largest gas producer among OECD nations by 2035, driven mainly by the booming liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector.
The International Energy Agency's annual World Energy Outlook report forecasts Australian gas production ranking third among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries towards the end of the projection period, which is 2035.
 By this stage, Australia's gas output will only be surpassed by the US and Canada, according to the report released overnight in London.
Australia's gas output was expected to eclipse Malaysia's by 2020 and Indonesia's by 2025.
The two nations are currently the biggest gas producers in the Asia Pacific region and major LNG exporters.
Graeme Bethune, chief executive of of Adelaide-based energy advisory and research firm Energy Quest, said Australian gas production was set to more than triple over the projection period.
It would be driven mainly by LNG export projects fed by coal seam gas in Queensland, he said.
Dr Bethune is the convenor of the Australian Institute of Energy's National Conference to be held in Adelaide next week, where the report will be presented.
He said Australian gas production was projected to grow at an average rate of 4.2 per cent per annum until 2035, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the world.
However, Australian coal production would barely grow, increasing by a mere 0.6 per cent per annum, while oil production was expected to fall, Dr Bethune said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Central Queensland welfare groups are concerned about the social and infrastructure impact of the emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry.
The State Government yesterday announced conditional approval of the Australia Pacific LNG project and two other gas projects already have the go-ahead.
 A final decision from the Federal Government on whether the Australia Pacific project will go ahead is expected by Christmas.
Up to 15,000 people will be needed to construct a series of LNG projects if they all proceed.
Welfare workers say that presents great economic and employment opportunities, but Salvation Army spokesman Captain Jeffrey Bush says there will also be added pressure on roads, health and housing.
 It's almost impossible to get a rental in Gladstone at the moment and if we're not set up enough, we could lose some of those because there isn't enough accommodation here,  he said.
Lifeline spokeswoman Mandy Jones says industry and all levels of government need to chip in.
 Everybody needs to accept a fair share of responsibility,  she said.
 We can't rely on people driving that one-and-a-half-hours to Rockhampton or Bundaberg to access services. 
Australia Pacific LNG has been ordered to provide housing for permanent staff once the project comes online.
Queensland Shelter's Andrian Pisarski says that is a welcome step, but more needs to be done to address housing affordability.
 One of the things that could happen is that those companies may just rent that housing off the market rather than adding to the supply of housing in the town,  he said.
 We want to make sure that when they're providing that housing they're actually adding to the overall supply not just taking up existing housing. 
He says with rental prices already too high, a more coordinated approach is needed to address the housing affordability issue.
 Perhaps we need some kind of summit to bring the resource companies together to bring all of the councils, to bring all of the housing interests together and to bring State Government and Federal Government interests together, so that we can really sit down and really work out a long-term plan,  he said.
Gladstone acting mayor Gail Sellers says the State Government's approval of another gas project has come sooner than expected.
Councillor Sellers says she is also concerned about the cumulative impact on the region's social infrastructure, including roads.
 Things like the four 'laning' of the highway from Boyne roundabout into Gladstone, we're going to need that overpass at the Kin Kora roundabout, we're going to need the crossroads at the Calliope crossroads,  she said.

 The State Government yesterday conditionally approved a third project to pipe gas to Gladstone in central Queensland and Premier Anna Bligh says the environmental risks are being managed.
But Basin Sustainability Alliance spokesman Ian Hayllor says artesian resources should be protected in the same way as the Lake Eyre Basin is to be protected under Queensland's Wild Rivers laws.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"THE Bligh government has approved the biggest coal-seam gas project to date in Queensland, despite a fresh contamination scare over wells in the state's booming production fields.
Arrow Energy reported that it had found traces of benzene in well water associated with its coal-seam gas operation at Moranbah, west of Mackay.
 The amounts were well within allowable limits, but it is the second occasion in the past few weeks when poisons known as the BTEX group -- benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes -- have been found in water associated with coal-seam mining operations in Queensland.
It came as Queensland's coal-seam gas industry was kicked along yesterday with the Australia Pacific LNG project being approved by the Queensland government.
The proposed $35 billion project still needs federal government approval. More importantly, it also needs customers before the two companies can definitely commit to the project.
The British-owned BG Group has committed to going ahead with a $15bn liquefied natural gas project. The South Australia-based Santos has received approval from the state and federal governments for a similar-sized project, but has not yet made a final investment decision.
The Australia Pacific LNG project is potentially larger than these two.
Coal-seam methane is extracted from the earth by pumping out water, which leads to gas automatically being pumped out of the ground.
But there is still no scientific consensus on whether BTEX occurs naturally in coal seams found well below the earth's surface or if it has been introduced into these operations through other means. One theory is that the BTEX could have leaked from mining machinery. Three weeks ago, the Australia Pacific LNG project, a joint venture between Australian company Origin and the multinational ConocoPhillips, announced it had found BTEX materials in some of its operations in western Queensland. The company is still investigating how the BTEX got there.
Project director Page Maxson said yesterday the company ``wants to be sure'' of final results before they were released. ``It could be 10 days, it could be a few weeks,'' he said. ``But we would rather get it right.''
Farmers have been strongly critical of what they say is undue haste from the government in approving the industry when its effect on farming environments is still unknown.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"ABOUT $50 billion worth of investment is poised to flood into Queensland after the State Government gave a conditional go-ahead for a third liquid natural gas project in Gladstone.
A day after a toxic chemical scare at a coal seam gas operation near Moranbah, Origin Energy's joint venture with Conoco/Phillips - called APLNG - was approved, sparking a potential $35 billion investment to bring Surat Basin gas to Curtis Island for processing and export.
 It follows the approvals for two other projects led by Santos and Queensland Gas.
If all three go ahead, a temporary city of up to 10,000 construction workers will spring up on Curtis Island to build the processing facilities and a potential 18,000 jobs will be created.
APLNG's project will add about $2 billion to the Queensland economy, but businesses warned that a wages breakout and jobs crisis was looming and Gladstone officials also warned the city was unable to cope and would need hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure.
The industry also must find a way to deal with an estimated 10 million tonnes of salt that will be a by-product of the gas extraction and is likely to be mostly tipped into landfill.
The Queensland Conservation Council warned that not enough was known to protect the environment from the huge scale of the three developments.
And while economists said the projects would provide a massive injection of wealth to the economy, there were still questions about where the full workforce of up to 18,000 will come from.
Although the Government and industry are investing in new labour and improving skills, Gladstone businesses fear a drain on the existing workforce and a wages breakout.
``People will go for the dollars and you can't blame them,'' Chamber of Commerce president Lance Harding said. ``Obviously it's going to end in a price war and the real fear is staff retention.''
Premier Anna Bligh said the projects represented a ``massive jump'' in the state's economic prosperity.
She said the companies would go through a rigorous process to ensure safety.
Gladstone's acting mayor Gail Sellers and independent MP Liz Cunningham said immediate action was needed to help the city.
Ms Cunningham said if the government didn't invest in critical health and road infrastructure now, it would be ``too late'' for the town that she says ``will never be the same''.
``This infrastructure can't cope at the moment, let alone when you inject thousands of people into the town,'' she said.
Infrastructure and Planning Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said the co-ordinator general's EIS process would detect and mitigate potential impacts on infrastructure like affordable housing, family support, community and health facilities.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"COULD Origin Energy and its US partner ConocoPhillips be a chance of making a final investment decision on their Queensland coal seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas project?
Yesterday's environmental nod from the Queensland Government was expected, given that both the proposed BG and Santos plants had been approved, although with a swag of conditions.
 And given the recent Federal Government go-ahead, Canberra's green light should be a formality.
But Origin and Conoco still have a seemingly large hurdle to jump. They are yet to announce any LNG sales contracts from their proposed Australia Pacific LNG plant on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour.
This has recently led many analysts to discount any possibility that they will be able to make an early decision to proceed with what would be Gladstone's third massive LNG development.
Citigroup analysts recently suggested Origin and Conoco might at best have to settle for a single-processing plant (or train) start-up for APLNG, rather than the two-train project they had been targeting.
Origin shares fell 25c to $26.19.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"A glowing prospect
One of the few alternatives left for BHP Billiton is to take over Woodside Petroleum. This could be a bonus for investors as the oil and gas giant, especially after yesterday's sell-off, is an attractive investment in its own right. The company is the world's third- largest producer of liquefied natural gas and has an advantage over the new coal seam gas to LNG facilities being developed in Queensland. The company's North West Shelf cost $30billion to build but has a replacement value of around $50billion. Obviously, for BHP it would be
 cheaper to take over Woodside than attempting to build a competitor. What adds spice is that Shell Energy yesterday reduced its shareholding in Woodside by 10per cent, from 34.27per cent to 24.27per cent. The company reported an excellent 2010 half-year result with net profit after tax at $US813million, up 26per cent on the previous half. Woodside is appropriate for conservative investors.
Beware the rush
It is party time for investors overweight in soaring gold and resource stocks, but it cannot last. When stockmarkets are driven by inflationary expectations rather
than company results it is time for caution. China, and other trade surplus nations, are switching out of the falling US dollar and into commodities and gold. Also, the world's economic giants are letting the value of their currencies fall to make their exports cheaper. The US is now pumping out another $US600billion dollars but China's yuan is tied to the US dollar! This is causing economic problems in other Asian nations and in Australia the rising dollar is distorting our economy. Are we facing a repeat of the 1930s currency race to the bottom? Perhaps we base metal and gold bugs should take some profits?

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Another week, another chemical scare. Queensland's coal-seam gas industry may be trumpeting the dawn of a new era of $50 billion in liquefied natural gas investment, but behind the headlines there is concern over a second toxin scare in less than a month.
Arrow Energy, a venture between Shell and PetroChina, said on Monday it had detected small traces of the cancer-causing agent benzene in samples taken from its Moranbah coal-seam gas project in the Bowen Basin in central Queensland.
 Arrow's scare followed a similar revelation by Origin Energy in October after traces of the cancer-causing agents benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) were found in surface-water testing in its wells near Miles, 300 kilometres west of Brisbane. forcing the company to halt work at the wells as a result.
The Queensland government so far seems relaxed about the toxin discoveries. The state yesterday approved Origin's $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project, despite calls for a moratorium on new CSG projects.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has defended the tight environmental safeguards in place as sufficient to protect areas surrounding coal-seam gas sites.
But calls are growing louder from landowners and farmers, including the National Farmers Federation, for a more thorough assessment of the ongoing effect on ground-water supplies.
Grahame Baker, a senior adviser at Brisbane-based consultancy Resource and Land Management Services, says while cancer concerns may prove unfounded, more testing was needed.
 As you slowly mature coals, you would normally expect to get trace amounts of benzene in the parts per billion range. But what we don't know is the source â€“ has it been contaminated due to drilling, is it an accident or is it natural phenomena? You couldn't yet say either way.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Queensland's $50 billion liquefied natural gas industry received its second major boost in a little over a week after Origin Energy and joint venture partner ConocoPhillips received state environmental approval from the Queensland governmenfor a $35 billion project.
Origin and Conoco, which each hold a 50 per cent stake in the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) project, won the go-ahead despite announcing a toxin scare on eight exploration wells during drilling at the project last month.
 The companies are now waiting on federal approval for the project, expected by year's end.
The state approval follows a commitment last month from a rival LNG developer, the UK's BG Group, to build its own $US15 billion project in the state, the first of four Queensland projects to start construction.
Earlier in October federal Environment Minister Tony Burke gave conditional approval to BG's project and a third rival facility, Santos's $16 billion Gladstone LNG project, to proceed. A fourth LNG project, being developed by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina, is also in the planning stages.
Origin says approval has been granted for the development of the gas field over a 30-year period along with a 450 kilometre transmission pipeline and an LNG facility on Â­Curtis Island.
While the company has largely caught up on its two rivals in terms of scheduling, it said there was no battle to be the first project across the line.
 There's not a race,  said APLNG project director Page Maxson.
 It's not a matter of competing for a prize as to who gets there first. It's much more important that we execute the project correctly. 
In October, Origin announced trace levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as BTEX had been detected in eight exploration wells at the project, renewing calls from environmental groups for a moratorium on the industry.
APLNG said it met with 6000 stakeholders, including landowners and non-government organisations, during an 18-month period with 36 formal submissions received from government agencies and the public.
APLNG has been lagging behind the rival coal seam gas to LNG projects proposed in Gladstone in terms of LNG marketing with no agreements yet announced on customers. The delay in signing up Â­customers has raised serious doubts over APLNG's target for reaching a final investment decision on building its first two gas processing trains by the end of 2010.
The companies are holding talks with potential buyers in Asia over LNG sales.  We are in active dialogue with customers and there is interest in our project,  Mr Maxson said.
 We are confident we will have the project in order and ready for a final investment decision by year-end.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"A RAPID increase in gas production in Australia could threaten billions of dollars in liquefied natural gas projects for companies yet to secure offtake agreements for their product.
The annual World Energy Outlook released by the International Energy Agency shows Australia is positioned to increase gas production by 4.2 per cent a year out to 2035. At that point it will overtake Norway and trail only the US and Canada as the biggest gas producer in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 Graeme Bethune, convener of the Australian Institute of Energy's national conference in Adelaide next week, where the IEA paper will be presented, said LNG proponents in Australia would have more trouble advancing projects the longer they waited.
 The projects that are in construction now and have supply contracted have an advantage because others still have to go out into this market and sell it,  he said.
 That market is going to present a significant increase in production, like about 60 million tonnes a year by the end of the decade, which will triple where we are now. 
The forecast could be taken into account as the market speculates on suitors for Woodside Petroleum in light of Shell's sale of 10 per cent of the company and its plans to offload its remaining 24.27 per cent stake.
Woodside has already had to bat away criticism that some of its projects, such as its Browse or Sunrise joint venture projects, will struggle to meet timelines and may never make it into production.
Woodside's chief Don Voelte claims it has an oversupply of Asian customers wanting its 50 per cent share of the 12 million tonnes of LNG from Browse.
The IEA report says that by 2020 Australia will produce more gas than Malaysia and by 2025 will overtake gas production out of Indonesia.
While gas production is expected to grow quickly â€” delivering more than 5000 petajoules by 2035 â€” Australia's coal production will stay relatively stagnant, growing at 0.6 per cent a year.
Nobuo Tanaka, IEA executive director, said government support for renewables would increase from $US57 billion in 2009 to $US205 billion by 2035, under the agency's New Policies Scenario.

â€œBrendan Ostwald came to Nudgee, and he was offering scholarships for diesel-fitting and earthmoving. I've had an interest in big machinery ever since I was a kid. They pay for our TAFE and we get a trade out of it,â€? Todd said.
â€œIn Brisbane it might have been pretty hard to get a job, but there's plenty of work out here â€“ we've always got jobs starting. New jobs are coming up from the CSG industry. More people are coming; it's a good thing.â€?
Todd's boss, Brendan Ostwald, has grown his company from one employee, 20 years ago, to a 400-strong team today.
â€œWe've been involved with the CSG industry since its beginnings,â€? he said.
â€œWe currently contract to all four major players, QGC being our largest customer in that field.â€?
Mr Ostwald is proud to have nurtured and grown his team by providing a number of bursaries annually to students from Brisbane's Nudgee College and Dalby's Our Lady of the Southern Cross school.
Every three years, he rewards top trainees with a trip to an international construction expo in Las Vegas.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"THE Queensland government has signed off on environmental approvals for a $35 billion coal seam gas project, despite a warning from its own experts that the risk to groundwater could not be quantified.
Queensland Co-ordinator-General Graeme Newton approved the Origin and ConocoPhillips Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project this week, but warned that groundwater levels across its southern Queensland development were expected to drop 15m on average.
 The energy giants expected all existing water bores in the Walloon Coal Measures to ``in effect, be lost or significantly affected, and will have to be made good''.
The approval, which follows confirmation that BG Group will proceed with its $15bn CSG to LNG project, underlines the government's eagerness for the new industry to create up to 10,000 jobs and to boost the state's bottom line by 4 per cent.
During the gas-extraction process, wells are drilled 300m to 600m below ground, pushing briny water and gas to the surface because of the pressure gradient. The gas will be transported to Gladstone, where it will be converted to liquid form.
During the 30-year APLNG project, more than 1000 gigalitres of water will be extracted, the equivalent of the capacity of two Sydney Harbours.
Chairman of the Basin Sustainability Alliance, Dalby landholder Ian Hayllor, said the resources of the Great Artesian Basin should be protected. ``It is just crazy to allow an industry to go ahead when we do not understand the full long-term impacts that it will have,'' he said.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the industry would be ``monitored strictly'' and needed to demonstrate its activities were having no effect on the groundwater aquifers.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WOODSIDE is one of Australia's most recognised global companies. It is Australia's leading independent oil and gas explorer, developer and producer, and invests heavily in responsible and sustainable development.
Woodside is also one of the world's leading producers of liquefied natural gas, helping meet the demands for cleaner energy from Japan, China, Korea and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Woodside is a very active member of the West Australian community, but also supports community programs around Australia.
 Each year Woodside provides financial and in-kind support to a wide range of community groups. This support includes Woodside stand-alone funding, as well as on an equity basis through joint ventures in which they participate.
``We formalised our social community and investment programs back in 1999,'' Jo Ferry, Woodside manager for community affairs, said.
``The London Benchmark Group report gives you great clarity on where you are investing money and time into the community. We were surprised at how much we were investing into the arts sector coupled with our science and education commitments.
``The report has helped give us clarity and put together a strategic plan to re-align and refocus our interests between social investment and business strategy.''
Woodside's social investment activities focus on health and well-being. There are three categories to Woodside's social investment program: Living Energy, focusing on personal health and well-being; Natural Energy, focusing on environmental health and well-being; and Creative energy, which concentrates on community health and well-being. In 2010, 34 different organisations received financial support from Woodside under the three divisions.
In Living Energy, Surf Live Saving Australia, Global Corporate Challenge, Telethon Speech & Hearing, and Australian Rotary Health were the beneficiaries.
In Natural Energy, the Western Australian Museum, Conservation Volunteers Australia, Marine Discovery West, Great Gardens and Recfishwest received support. And finally in the Creative Energy section, the University of Western Australia Business School, West Australian Ballet, Ngala, WA Aboriginal Dance Company, Western Australian Youth Orchestra and the Art Gallery of Western Australia were among a plethora of organisations benefiting from Woodside's generosity.
``Not only is the community an important stakeholder, but so are our employees,'' Ferry said. ``We surveyed our staff and one of the most common areas of interest was Surf Living Saving Australia. Our employees were concerned about sun protection, skin cancer and saving lives down the beach, so we became involved. We have a three-tiered model for our community investment at a national, state and local level. We have a strong fit with each community program that we support.''
The LBG states that Woodside's 2009 calendar year social investment program contribution was $9.2 million (inclusive of management costs), an increase of more than $1.3m to the 2008 total. The 2010 figure has yet to be calculated.
One of the big projects Woodside has invested in heavily is the Western Australia Museum.
Since 1998, Woodside and the museum have collaborated to investigate and document the marine biodiversity of the waters of northwestern Western Australia and to contribute to its conservation. Specific work has occurred in the Pilbara and the Kimberley, areas of great significance from a natural heritage and industrial usage point of view.
The WA Museum's and Woodside's mutual interest in and commitment to environmental protection provided a foundation for the collaboration.
Initiated in the UN Year of the Ocean (1998), the Woodside and WA Museum collaboration has so far documented more than 6700 marine species from the waters of northwestern Australia and described more than 290 species new to science. It has also recorded major range extensions of many known species and made the first significant collections of many species previously never or rarely studied. In addition, more than 90 scientists from 25 countries, 19 international museums, 42 universities, 16 Australian government agencies, 19 industry and private partners, film and documentary makers, local communities and stakeholders have been involved in our collaboration projects.
The Woodside Collection is a unique, perpetual reference to the biodiversity of the Indo-West Pacific region and is accessible to a worldwide audience through the interactive, educational and cultural resource at http://wamuseum.com.au/dampier/[http://wamuseum.com.au/dampier/]
The Woodside Collection (Dampier Archipelago and Kimberley) establishes the museum as the key tropical marine biodiversity repository in Australia, as well as a key regional biodiversity repository in a global context.
The research has direct relevance to West Australian government management agencies such as the Department of Environment and Conservation, Environmental Protection Authority, Department of Planning, Department of Transport and Department of Fisheries.
``Woodside are proud to be active members of investing back into the community,'' Ferry said. ``We are very flexible with our investments and with what community organisations that we work with. We believe that our investments contribute to a better Australia overall, and Woodside will continue to invest in a better Australia.''

ANZ gives mob what it has been baying for
From P34
So the ANZ has given the mob what it has been baying for. Presumably it hopes it might even win applause by adding only 14 points to the Reserve Bank's official rate rise compared with the CBA's 20 points.
That was the second and much more clear-cut reality that the ANZ took its eight days to bow to. The reality that the cost of raising the money for its lending has risen by more than the RBA official rate rises.
The end product is that the ANZ's variable rate at 7.8 per cent will be just one point lower than the CBA's 7.81 per cent.
Depending how you look it, that's a difference that's not worth worrying about, in the sense of upending all your banking.
But it is still real money - about 75 a week on a $300,000 loan. And for most people that would mean having to earn at least $1.05, every week, before tax.
The rate chosen by ANZ leaves an interesting question for the two  other guys , because they start from different positions.
Westpac did its CBA a year ago, almost doubling an official rate rise, so that its pre-change core rate was the highest at 7.51 per cent.
If it fully followed the CBA, it would go back to being easily the highest at 7.91 per cent but would, therefore, also have preserved its margins best.
Or it could limit its rise to something closer to the official increase, winning some plaudits, yet finish around where the CBA is.
Earlier this year, NAB chose a competitive marketing tool: to promise to hike only by the official changes.
So it had the lowest rate at 7.24 per cent and would still be lower than Westpac's pre-change rate if it did so again.
Trust me. NAB will ditch that promise.
The only question is what it dresses it up with, ANZ-style.
The other changes announced by ANZ yesterday were temporary and purely marketing exercises. It's trying to lure its own and other bank customers into three-year, fixed-term loans.
So it's offering a cut-price three-year fixed rate - and to cut charges for borrowers switching into the fixed-rate loan. This is not unlike the low-rate lures the banks offer for balance switches on credit cards.
What might persuade the other banks to follow the ANZ into dumping exit fees is the combination of the benefit of feeding the mob and the new ASIC rules.
Dumping exit fees can be made costless to the bank - either by reintroducing loan establishment charges or absorbing it in the overall interest margin. Especially if ASIC is going to make it all too hard.
The devil in the ASIC guidance is in the detail, specifically not allowing the bank to recover loss of profits from an early loan termination and marketing costs.
ANZ CEO Mike Smith has probably never heard of Joh.
But the urbane Englishman might just have become Joh II.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"THE chairman of Eastern Star Gas and a former Nationals party leader, John Anderson, has rejected claims he is betraying farmers in northern NSW by heading a company that proposes to run a gas pipeline through their land.
The company is planning to extract coal-seam gas from below the artesian basin near Narrabri, and pipe it to a proposed power station at Wellington.
 Mr Anderson said that  far from seeing it as a betrayal of farmers' interests, I see it as ... being in their interests .
 Australia is running out of oil. I do not see any other option than gas as an energy source for things like farming as an interim step. 
But he acknowledged concerns about the way farmers may have been treated by project managers engaged to study the feasibility of the pipeline. He told yesterday's annual general meeting the company would investigate and take action against any inappropriate behaviour.
The Sydney meeting was overshadowed by a rally outside of farmers who oppose the proposed pipeline route because they say it could cause erosion of a fragile floodplain. They want the pipe to run along travelling stock routes instead.
The group, the Mullaley Gas Pipeline Accord, accuse Eastern Star's consultants, CNC Project Management, of using unethical tactics to gain agreement from individual landholders for easements over their lands.
An accord spokesman, James Bishop, said CNC had harassed farmers with late-night phone calls and lied about talks with other farmers.  Farmers say they are being threatened and told that their neighbours are co-operating when they are not,  he said.
CNC referred questions to an Eastern Star spokesman, who said:  We urge anyone with specific details to contact us immediately and we will pursue it with our contractors.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The strong Australian dollar has inflated the cost of liquefied natural gas developments for overseas groups, writes Paul Garvey.
The stronger Australian dollar that sweetened the proceeds from Royal Dutch Shell's sale of Woodside shares is also stinging Shell and the other foreign companies looking to invest in the nation's liquefied natural gas sector.
 Some $200 billion in new LNG investments is either under way or earmarked for development in Australia in the coming years, but the strong $A has added an estimated $20 billion to the price tag. The impost comes at a particularly sensitive time for Australia's energy sector, with several major projects closing in on final investment decisions.
The currency movement will also provide additional incentive for foreign energy companies to outsource as much associated work as possible overseas, and potentially crimp the economics of proposed developments.
For companies reporting their earnings in $A â€“ such as Santos and Origin Energy â€“ the recent currency movements have made the US dollar-denominated components of their LNG developments 20 per cent cheaper. Their foreign project partners and companies such as Woodside, which now reports its earnings in $US, may not be so lucky.
The $A has appreciated by almost 20 per cent since the end of May. The move helped Shell realise a better price in $US for the 78.3 million Woodside shares it sold for $3.3 billion on Monday, with the 10.8 per cent gain in Woodside shares since May translating into a 38 per cent increase in $US terms.
The favourable movement for Shell on the Woodside transaction looks set to be more than offset once the company begins rolling out its portfolio of new LNG investments.
Shell is involved in five proposed LNG projects in Australia, with Deutsche Bank estimating its total share of capital expenditure across those projects at over $32 billion.
Around half the capital expenditure linked to LNG projects is expected to be incurred in Australia, primarily through labour costs, meaning the 20 per cent increase in the $A translates into roughly a 10 per cent increase in overall project costs for foreign companies.
Australia's LNG landscape is dominated by companies that report their earnings in $US, including Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Woodside.
The currency headwind faced by those companies comes on top of already increasing cost pressures due to tight labour markets.
Woodside's $13 billion Pluto LNG project under construction in north-west Western Australia has already suffered a $1 billion cost blowout, and the company is set to again increase the budget this month.
Even before the $A movement, LNG companies were taking steps to minimise exposure to Australia's hot labour market. Woodside has started developing LNG projects in modules overseas before assembling the infrastructure on site, and the approach is being adapted by other LNG companies.
The Cascade LNG technology earmarked for use in Queensland's coal seam gas projects is being adapted to modular form for the first time.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said the modular approach would reduce project costs by taking advantage of lower overseas labour costs.
 If the unemployment level was higher in the country I'm sure there'd be some issues [over modular developments], but the labour market is actually stretched,  Ms Brookman said.
 If it couldn't be done this way it probably couldn't be done at all because the capex costs would be significantly higher.

BRISBANE, Nov 12 AAP - A coal mine has been approved for Queensland's Surat Basin which is already home to an expanding coal seam gas (CSG) industry.
 Infrastructure and Planning Minister Stirling Hinchliffe announced on Friday an independent Coordinator-General has given the proposed $3 billion Wandoan Coal project conditional approval.
The Xstrata Coal joint project is proposing an open-cut coal mine, a coal handling and preparation plant and support facilities in the Surat Basin, west of the town of Wandoan in the state's southwest.
The Surat Basin is already home to the burgeoning CSG industry.
Three CSG projects have been approved in the Surat and Bowen basins in recent weeks despite water contamination scares including traces of benzene found in central Queensland gas wells on Tuesday.
The Wandoan coal mine is expected to produce thermal coal for export markets and possibly domestic markets for more than 30 years.
Mr Hinchliffe says the approval follows nearly three years of environmental assessment.
The project requires federal government environmental assessment and approval.
 The Wandoan Coal project, and associated infrastructure and exploration initiatives, would open up the basin as the next major new export region for Queensland,  Mr Hinchliffe said.
He said construction of the mine and facilities could begin at the end of 2011 and exports forecast to begin as early as 2014.
A proposed railway between Wandoan and Moura to link with other railway lines to port facilities at Gladstone is expected to transport the coal.
The Coordinator-General is currently undertaking a separate environmental assessment for the rail project.

 Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu and Nationals Leader Peter Ryan campaigned in the rural seat of Ripon in central Victoria on Friday, held by the ALP's Agriculture and Small Business Minister Joe Helper by a margin of 4.3 per cent.
The town of Avoca, northeast of Melbourne, was the stage for the opposition's promise to connect an initial 12 towns to the state's natural gas pipelines if the coalition wins government on November 27.
Ripon is considered to be one of Labor's most vulnerable seats.
Consumers will have to pay connection costs of up to $1000 to tap into the proposed network but Mr Baillieu said residents could save between $600 and $1200 a year.
He said the government's natural gas rollout plan had come to an end and the coalition's plan would encourage business and residents to regional communities.
 The rollout of natural gas means a boost for those towns, they have an opportunity to grow,  Mr Baillieu told reporters in Avoca.
 It's a boost for the residents of those towns who are relieved of the difficulties and the high prices of power or wood or other supplies of energy. 
Labor has connected 34 towns to natural gas at a cost of $70 million since coming to power but Premier John Brumby said the program stopped because the government had connected all the towns it could.
 Some of them were simply geographically impossible to do,  he told reporters in Melbourne.
 We've done all the ones that can be sensibly achieved. 
But Mr Baillieu said Avoca was only about 7km from the closest pipeline.

 Bow is now in a strong position to fund ongoing exploration and appraisal activities, production pilots, field infrastructure and pipeline approvals as well as completion of Bow's 30 MW (megawatt) Blackwater power project (in Queensland),  Mr De Stefani said.
He said the activities aimed at delivering commercial gas flows and early cash flow from electricity sales.
The company also sought to achieve gas reserves of 6,200 petajoules in the 3P or `proved plus probable plus possible' category and 1,250PJ in the 2P or `proved plus probable' category by the end of 2011 across its Bowen Basin CSG fields.
 Concurrently, Bow will continue with plans for the development of its reserves, targeting both domestic gas and export LNG markets,  Mr De Stefani said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Coalition will spend $100-million connecting regional towns to natural gas if it is elected later this month.
The money will come from the $1 billion regional growth fund.
 Nationals' Leader Peter Ryan says regional councils would have to bid for the money.
He says the availablity of natural gas is necessary to the economic prosperity of regional Victoria.
 We intend, through this $100 million fund, to ensure that so many more of these communities are able to have access to it,  he said.
 Because from both a residential and commercial point of view, it is an absolute necessity,  he said.
Mr Ryan says country towns need natural gas to help encourage business growth.
 The basic problem is a lot of our communities don't have natural gas because they don't have enough business to demand its presence. On the other hand, they can't grow business because they don't have natural gas.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Oil company Shell could establish the world's first floating liquefied natural gas processing plant off Western Australia's north west coast after receiving Federal Government approval for the project.
The Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke has granted Shell approval for its Prelude Project, 475 kilometres north of Broome.
 Shell's Prelude project vice president, Bruce Steenson, says the innovative technology is cheaper and greener than processing gas onshore.
 We put the LNG facilities over the field offshore, we don't have to put any compression or pipelines or dredging or onshore facilities that would be part of a traditional LNG development,  he said.
 That means not only can we develop these smaller fields but it's a lower overall environmental impact. 
 This is the next step in offshore development and particularly LNG development. It does mean that we can go to the more remote places to produce gas that we previously couldn't do. 
Greens Senator Scott Ludlam says he is concerned about the risks to marine life and greenhouse gas emissions.
 There's nothing clean and green about dumping 2.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air every year in an age of climate change,  he said.
 We expect that the companies will just try and get away with what they can but for the Environment minister to be wondering around the state talking about strict conditions when you actually get to the nuts and bolts there's some hazy promises, there's no existent conditions. 
The project is at the engineering and design phase and Shell will make a final investment decision next year.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"LAETITIA LEMKE, PRESENTER: Environmentalists say a plan by the Japanese liquid natural gas giant, Inpex, to blast a shipping channel through Darwin Harbour could be devastating for one of Australia's most threatened dolphins, the Snubfin. The company says it needs to blast a rock outcrop out of the shipping channel it wants to use, but it will monitor for dolphins before setting off any charges. Green groups say that's inadequate and they want the company to consider an alternative shipping route. Jane Bardon reports.
JIM SMITH, SEA DARWIN: Snubfin dolphins are very shy animals. They have a smile on their face, they're lovely animals and yet we know virtually nothing about them. And they're uniquely Australian animals, what's more, and that's something very special.
 JANE BARDON, REPORTER: Jim Smith's eco-tourism business is still small, but he thinks Darwin Harbour's rich biodiversity offers potential to grow. The Australian snubfin dolphins here are a species identified just five years ago. They've only been photographed in Darwin - these snubfins were filmed off Broome. Indo-Pacific humpback and coastal bottlenose dolphins are also regularly seen near Darwin city. But Jim Smith is worried the dolphins will be scared away or killed if the gas company Inpex blasts out a shipping channel in Darwin Harbour.
JIM SMITH: Well, clearly if it's close enough it could kill them in terms of the blasting. I would imagine that you'll see that the animals will leave this place.
JANE BARDON: Inpex says it needs to blast away the Walker Shoal rock outcrop because it's blocking the shipping route to its planned gas plant. The company wants to set off 300 kilograms of explosives, three times a day, for up to 14 months. Its draft Environmental Impact Statement says there's a  medium risk  blasting could kill dolphins 470 metres away, and injure them within a kilometre and a quarter. Environmentalists say Inpex has based its estimates on outdated science.
STUART BLANCH, DIRECTOR NT ENVIRONMENT CENTRE: Inpex's use of a 37-year-old study blasting monkeys and sheep and dogs held underwater to look at the impact on dolphins is a complete joke. For a $20 billion project I think it's a complete embarrassment.
JANE BARDON: Rob McCauley has spent much of his career researching the effects of noise and explosions on marine animals. He says Inpex has underestimated the kill zone.
ROB MCCAULEY, CENTRE FOR MARINE SCIENCE CURTIN UNIVERSITY: With a safety factor of two for the Walker Shoal explosives you would expect that animals beyond perhaps two kilometres are out of the lethal zone and that somewhere within that two kilometres animals will be killed outright.
JANE BARDON: Rob McCauley says any deaths will be grisly.
ROB MCCAULEY: The lung spaces in dolphins will collapse under the initial pressure and then if you get a negative pressure immediately following then they literally explode if the pressure difference is big enough.
JANE BARDON: Inpex says it will try to prevent injuries by having people on boats looking out for marines animals before explosives are detonated. Rob McCauley says monitoring above the water won't be enough to see whether there are dolphins within two kilometres.
ROB MCCAULEY: The best way that they can do it, there are commercial fish finders which are sector scanning sonars, there are some quite good varieties of those around. They could deploy perhaps one or two of those on chase vessels and they could actually scan the entire area for large fauna, and that would include things like crocodiles, sea turtles, dolphins.
JANE BARDON: Green groups say Inpex should use another shipping route.
STUART BLANCH: Inpex needs to either look at moving north of Walker Shoal or moving south of Walker Shoal.
JANE BARDON: Inpex says it can't go south of Walker Shoal because the wreck of the Heritage Listed Navy refuelling ship, the Kelat, is in the way. Shipwreck historian Tom Lewis has dived the Kelat. He says it's not as important as the wrecks of warships attacked in Japanese air raids in 1942 on which hundreds died.
TOM LEWIS, AUTHOR 'WRECKS IN DARWIN WATER': Kelat's a different wreck, she was basically only a coal hulk and that's all she was and she was sunk in non-significant circumstances, so I suppose just raise what we can, a few significant items and leave it at that.
JANE BARDON: Marine archaeologist Silvano Jung says the Kelat was sunk in Australia's equivalent of Pearl Harbour and must be preserved. He says Inpex's assessment that going North of Walker Shoal would take its gas boats too close to East Arm Wharf are questionable.
SILVANO JUNG, MARINE ARCHAEOLOGIST: There's still a 500 metre gap between Walker Shoal and the new East Arm wharf and I think that that should be enough room to get a ship through.
JANE BARDON: Green groups are also worried because Inpex has conceded it's possible sediment from dredging its shipping channel could damage seagrass on which dugongs feed. The environmentalists say they don't want to stop the project going ahead, but they want the Northern Territory and Federal governments to make sure the company minimises damage. They're concerned that the Territory Government has refused to let its own marine scientists talk publicly about the environmental impacts, while talking up economic windfalls.
STUART BLANCH: I'm hearing Delia Lawrie, Paul Henderson, welcoming Inpex, saying when it goes ahead it's going to be fantastic. It's going to pop up our economy for four decades. I think senior ministers are pre-empting the decision and I think they're making it harder for the community to have confidence in Karl Hampton and his agency to oversee an impartial, objective EIS response.
KARL HAMPTON, NORTHERN TERRITORY ENVIRONMENT MINISTER: There are some issues there that Inpex now needs to go away and address through their supplementary process. So my main objective is to make sure that they do go through the highest levels of environmental assessment. That's really important and I have been listening to the concerns and certainly in terms of the wildlife, the issues in the harbour and certainly in terms of the greenhouse emissions of the project.
JANE BARDON: No-one from Inpex wanted to be interviewed.
STUART BLANCH: Inpex tell us they're not a bottom feeder company. That they're concerned about being good corporate citizens in Darwin, we say to them, okay, fix up your plan, don't make us go to court, we can lock this up in court for a long time if we have to.
JANE BARDON: Tour operator Jim Smith wants the Territory Government to take control of Darwin harbour. He says it's not good enough to just react to each new development application from companies like Inpex. Instead it should draw up a plan for the harbour's industrial growth and environmental protection.
JIM SMITH: It would be great to get some vision equivalent to Inpex and beyond Inpex for the harbour so that this place keeps its natural values to the best of our ability and still meets the economic requirements of our society.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"ETHICAL and responsible investment funds were being warned that the coal seam gas industry was no longer considered a safe bet because of its environmental threats.
Research firm for the ethical and charitable investment funds CAER said people now had to be aware of the risks around CSG and underground coal gasification.
 The company provides research for firms like Ausbil Dexia, Australian Ethical Investment, Macquarie Sustainable Agricultural Fund, World Vision Australia and Dalton Nicol Reid, which then use it as a base for their investment decisions.
``Coal seam gas has gone from a lay down misere to something that has to be actively monitored at the moment,'' CAER's Duncan Patterson said.
``One of the key areas of risk is the lack of knowledge in this country about subterranean water.
``That's the kind of stuff we don't know about. No one knows about what happens to water underground.''
The underground water has raised significant concerns in the Surat Basin where farmers and environmentalists fear crucial aquifers will be depleted by the CSG extraction.
Mr Patterson said CSG was not as high risk as coal or oil but underground coal gasification had much bigger issues.
``UCG is at the higher end with the evidence we have seen from Cougar Energy (at Kingaroy) and the ability of the Government to shut the operation down,'' he said.
``CSG is a watching brief but it's not the high end just yet and as an investor you would have to look at the enthusiastic support it gets from the Queensland Government.
``We are drawing our clients' attention to the risk.''
Traditionally a lot of investors have favoured investment in gas because it has lower greenhouse gas emissions.
``I would not want to say the responsible investment community sees it as a good thing because that's not the case,'' he said.
Australian Ethical Investment's executive director James Thier said CSG could still fit into a green investment fund but there were more issues arising as the industry grew.
``Funds are looking at it with greater scrutiny,'' he said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"BOW Energy, originally spun out of Arrow Energy as a traditional oil and gas explorer, was off to market yesterday seeking to raise $78 million.
Most of that, interestingly, given Bow's history, will go to coal seam gas exploration and development - and in Bow's eyes hopefully position it to take a part in Queensland's multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas boom.
 Bow said it expected to raise $48 million, through an institutional placement, led by Merrill Lynch and Wilson HTM - though the placement is not underwritten.
It will raise up to another $30 million through an offer to existing shareholders.
The shares are being offered at $1.15 each, a 11.5 per cent discount to their close on Wednesday.
Bow - which was recently bought by Shell and PetroChina as a basis for their Queensland coal seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas ambitions - said the funds would be applied to CSG exploration, production pilot wells and the group's 30MW power station being built at Blackwater.
Bow, which originally was due to be the Bow and Arrow conventional oil and gas arm, but turned to CSG as it became flavour of the decade, sees the power station as one way to ``monetise'' some of its CSG.
Arrow took a similar and highly successful route to cash flow early in its development.
But supplying one of the big LNG players is the prize.
And to that end, Bow is investigating a pipeline from its northern-most CSG area, around Norwich Park, to Blackwater. A 275km pipeline is then planned to extend into Gladstone.
For the time being, however, Bow - as Arrow did - plans to prove up as much gas as it can, to complete the power station and therefore give itself a steady cash flow, as well as to seek domestic gas contracts.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The formal end to the G20 Summit in Seoul today will allow Korea's politicians to get back to the task of running the country.
For oil and gas play Santos, there will be plenty of crossed fingers that the end of the G20 may finally see the Korean government sign off on the company's multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas supply deal.
 Santos has been waiting for months for the deal with state-owned giant Korea Gas to be approved by the Korean government. The deal would provide certainty to both the first and second LNG trains, or processing lines, Santos is planning to build at its Gladstone LNG project.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman believes the finish of G20 may be just the trigger the Koreans need to end Santos' inordinate wait. Brookman yesterday pointed out that the 2008 APEC summit was the event of choice as John Howard and his Chinese counterpart witnessed a deal between Woodside's Browse LNG project and PetroChina, saying the stage couldn't be better for Kogas to come on board. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan are on hand in Seoul if Santos chief David Knox wants someone for the photo opportunity this weekend - although that seems like wishful thinking.
Signing up Kogas should be one of the last pieces of the GLNG puzzle before Santos and its partners can approve the project. An equity raising shouldn't be too far behind and on that note, Brookman believes Santos will only need to raise about $1 billion. That's well short of the $2 billion or so some others have been tipping.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"THE Coalition has promised to extend the state's natural gas network to a dozen regional towns if it wins government on November 27.
Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu yesterday visited Avoca in central Victoria to outline a $100 million plan that he says is crucial for country towns.
  The rollout of natural gas means a boost for those towns; they have the opportunity to grow and it's a boost for residents who are relieved of the difficulties and high prices of power or wood,  Mr Baillieu said.  Natural gas is a boon for every town in Victoria when it arrives. 
Gas companies have been reluctant to hook up smaller towns to the network because it is not financially viable.
Under the opposition's scheme, the money would be used as a  circuit breaker  to pick up these connection costs.
Mr Baillieu said there would be a one-off cost to residents, ranging from a few hundred dollars up to $1000, to hook up to the system.
He said this far outweighed the expensive monthly cost of bottled natural gas.
Towns mooted for the scheme are Maldon, Marong and Huntly (all near Bendigo), Orbost, Lakes Entrance, Invermay, Heathcote, Warburton, Bannockburn and Terang. The opposition plans to have the towns hooked up by 2014.
Avoca, population 1000, is in the marginal seat of Ripon, held by Agriculture Minister Joe Helper by 4.4 per cent, and the pipeline that feeds the main system is just seven kilometres from town.
Local Hayden Pilgrim has been campaigning for gas in Avoca for years and said the town was caught in a Catch 22: industry would not come to the town without the pipe, while gas had not been hooked up because there was no industry.
Regional and Rural Development Minister Jacinta Allan savaged the plan, saying it was too costly â€” Labor has connected 34 towns at $70 million â€” and that the plan did not compel gas companies to hook up.  Why is it costing Mr Baillieu $100 million to connect 12 towns, none of which he can guarantee will actually get it? 
Mr Baillieu's pledge came as Premier John Brumby announced another 100 renewable energy sector jobs had been created in Portland, with Keppel Prince signing a contract to make the wind towers for the $1 billion Macarthur wind farm.
The Premier also said a report completed by Carbon Market Economics showed Victoria would benefit from $9 billion in renewable energy investment and the creation of about 650 jobs each year until 2016.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"AMERICAN theatre director Josh Fox didn't set out to make a film, much less star in one. But when he received a letter offering him $100,000 in exchange for allowing some natural gas wells to be sunk on his farm in a pristine river valley in Pennsylvania, he decided to ask around.
What he discovered was shocking â€” and, he insists, of more than passing relevance to Australians as we embark on a future in which natural gas is touted as a  clean  alternative to oil and coal.
 Fox found there are more than 500,000 natural gas wells across the US, many tapped using a process called hydraulic fracturing, or  fracking . In this, a mix of highly toxic chemicals and water is pumped hundreds of metres underground, forcing the rock to crack, and releasing the natural gas trapped in it.
The problem is, about a third of the liquid stays below ground, and in many of the sites Fox visits in his documentary, it has leached into water supplies, as has the gas itself. People can't drink the water that comes out of their taps any more â€” and in some cases they can set it alight.
 This is a huge issue because once you've contaminated an aquifer you can't go back,  says Fox, who will host a Q&A session after his film is screened at Carlton's Cinema Nova tonight.
In America, the natural gas industry was granted an exemption from normal environmental controls by the Bush administration in 2005. Halliburton, the oil company of which Dick Cheney was chairman before becoming Bush's vice-president, is at the forefront of gas exploration.
Most people Fox visits in his rather rough and ready film live in remote areas, and rely on bore or creek water. But the area near his home that the industry wants to tap is something else: it's the primary catchment for the greater New York area, supplying water to about 16 million people.
 Fighting against this is a personal thing, but it's also something where you look around and you have this immense concern for all these different places,  he says.
That extends to Australia, too. According to the Greens, the coal-seam gas industry, as it is called here, is likely to drill up to 40,000 wells in Queensland alone by 2030, with each well occupying at least a hectare of prime agricultural land. Though the fracking technique used here differs slightly from that covered in Fox's film, the Greens say there are still risks.
In May, the Victorian government approved gas exploration in the Bay of Islands Coastal Park in the state's south-west.
All of which makes Gasland a film of  direct relevance for Australia as we are faced with the consequences of a coal-seam gas rush,  says Adam Bandt, the Greens federal MP for Melbourne, who will appear with Fox tonight.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"LNG: The federal government has given Royal Dutch Shell environmental approval to build its $10 billion Prelude floating liquefied natural gas project off Western Australia.
The decision follows four delays that have stretched the approvals process by six months. The floating LNG plant is expected to be the world's first, and if successful will open up smaller gasfields further offshore to development.
 ``Our floating LNG technology reduces the project cost and environmental footprint,'' Shell Australia chairman Ann Pickard said. ``It removes the need for offshore compression platforms, long pipelines to shore, nearshore works such as dredging and jetty construction and onshore development such as building roads, laydown areas and accommodation facilities.''
Environment Minister Tony Burke said the project had been approved until 2045 with conditions, including the development of a greenhouse gas abatement strategy. Development approval is expected next year with first production targeted for 2016. The 480m-long floating LNG ship is expected to cost about $US5bn.
The completed project will produce 3.6 million tonnes a year of LNG and 1.3 million tonnes of condensate, a light crude oil.
Shell and Woodside also plan to use floating LNG to develop the Sunrise project in the Timor Sea.
However, this will need the approval of East Timor, which is pushing for the Greater Sunrise gasfields to be developed through an onshore LNG plant there.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"The miracle survival of his son infused Richard Cottee with the resolve to succeed on Queensland's coal-seam gas fields
GAS tycoon Richard Cottee was famous for his mobile phone ring tone to the tune of ``Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas''.
 Now he's changed it to ``Please release me, let me go, for I don't love you any more''.
It's Cottee's way of saying goodbye to his beloved Queensland and the mining minnow QGC, which he turned into a $5.3 billion colossus.
The sagacious former lawyer walked away with $28.2 million when BG (British Gas) swallowed QGC (Queensland Gas Company) in a deal done on a single handshake with Frank Chapman, the British BG chief.
Perhaps Cottee's ring tone should be a song from Exile on Main Street. Chapman insists they parted as friends but makes it clear he didn't want Cottee working in the coal-seam gas industry in Queensland.
Cottee says he is living in exile in Melbourne
``I found Frank to be unusually honest and he remains a true friend and that is why I was willing to accede to his request on my initial exile from Queensland,'' Cottee says. ``What goes around, comes around.''
I met Cottee at Rockpool restaurant at the Crown Casino in Melbourne. He arrived with his trademark swagger, complete with the impish grin and bellowing laugh.
Now he is the chief executive of Nexus Energy, a Melbourne-based listed oil and gas company.
Its operations are focused on the Gippsland Basin, offshore Victoria, and the Browse Basin, offshore Western Australia.
``I had an enormous sense of loss leaving Queensland,'' he says. ``But the last thing I wanted was an undignified or acrimonious parting.
``At first they tried to talk me into staying. But it was time to go.
``It was emotionally hard to do what I did.
``I had a dream and I had to cash it in because it was the right thing to do for the shareholders.''
He says QGC was broke when he became CEO but gas had taken off in the US and he knew it had a bright future.
``Fifteen per cent of US gas demand was coming from CSG (coal-seam methane),'' he says.
``It was pretty clear to me there were substantial quantities to be had here.
``The real hurdle was finding access to markets.''
Cottee describes the gas business as intellectual bungy-jumping and says he was ``bored s---less'' after he left Queensland.
``I hate the status quo,'' he says.
Cottee believes a personal tragedy in 2000 gave him enormous strength to succeed.
His son, Lachlan, was two when he was found ``dead'' at the bottom of the family swimming pool at Brookfield, in Brisbane's west.
The toddler was partly revived, then hovered between life and death for three weeks.
He had suffered a stroke and required months of physio.

An inflammatory expose warns of the dangers of natural gas mining, writes SANDRA HALL.
 GASLAND
Directed by Josh Fox
Rated PG, 104 minutes
Rating: 4/5
In parts of the US, there are people who can light the water flowing from their kitchen taps - and it's not just a flicker. In one demonstration, a hapless householder has to leap back as a flame shoots up, singeing the hairs on his arm.
GasLand is an angry film but its director, Josh Fox, is far from being a tub-thumper. He has set out to systematically investigate methods used in the US for producing natural gas - a supposedly pure form of energy - and the evidence he has unearthed is devastating.
Fox ranges from upstate New York to Louisiana before heading west to Texas, Wyoming and Colorado. And as he goes, he gathers accounts by farmers and householders of the damage done to their land, livestock and the health of their families by the effects of natural gas mining.
He starts by declaring his own interest. In the spring of 2008, he received a letter from a natural gas company offering him $US100,000 ($98,770) for the right to drill on his sylvan stretch of land in upstate New York. His family has owned the land - and the house on it - for as long as he can remember and he wants to know exactly what he'll be paying for this ostensible windfall, so he takes his camera and goes on the road.
His first stop is the neighbouring town of Dimock in a previously idyllic part of Pennsylvania now studded with gas wells and the news is not good. It's here that residents have discovered an alarming new meaning for the term  fire water .
The cause of their misery, Fox explains, is hydraulic fracturing, the system used to free the gas from rock far beneath the Earth's surface. Miners pump in great volumes of sand and water at intense pressure but the mixture is also spiked with a cocktail of chemicals, which include methane and, it seems, it seeps into the aquifers that feed the area's water wells. It's a story we hear again and again as Fox travels through  gasland , parts of the country that sit on top of the Marcellus Shale, a massive natural gas deposit, affecting at least 25 US states.
Fox is young, with glasses and an inquiring expression and he greets each new revelation with wonder rather than indignation. Clearly, he can't believe his luck when the flammable water gives him the chance to illuminate his argument with some real fireworks. But he leaves most of the talking to those living with the gas wells in their backyards - and they need little encouragement.
Farmers sadly show him dying horses and cattle. A neurologist tells him about the increase she has seen in diseases of the human nervous system. A farmer fears he might have to walk off the holding his family has worked for generations. And in a sequence laced with gallows humour, Fox finds a woman who's been keeping the corpses of a selection of poisoned woodland animals in her freezer for months in the hope of finding someone interested enough to arrange autopsies.
Some property owners are suing the gas companies. Others initially accepted compensation on condition they remain silent but years of having to depend on bought water while worrying about the long-term effects of the contamination have prompted them to speak out.
Litigation, however, is complicated. Thanks to a decision by the Bush administration, the natural gas industry is exempt from having to conform to regulations laid down by the Safe Drinking Water Act and other environmental legislation. Last year, however, a group of Democratic congressmen introduced a bill aimed at repealing the exemption.
And Fox punctuates his narrative with footage from sittings of a US congressional committee considering the bill. As a result, we watch some very uncomfortable gas company bosses being ordered to recite the long list of toxic chemicals that are used in releasing the gas from its subterranean home.
But it's not just the water that's affected. There have been gas blowouts and explosions and there are fears of air pollution caused by waste water brought back to the surface and left awaiting disposal in big open pits.
The natural gas industry has been outraged by the film, calling it sensationalist propaganda. It argues, too, that the use of hydraulic fracturing is not new: it's been going on for some 60 years with no confirmed cases of contamination.
But as the film shows, confirmation is difficult. The companies have been countering landowners' complaints by asserting that they have no proof because they didn't have their water tested before the arrival of the gas wells. And the current boom in natural gas has bumped up the drilling to a scale far beyond the point at which past experience can be definitive.
The film is a powerful alarm - and an evocative one.
Fox takes his banjo with him on his travels through the plains, forests and mountains that sit atop the Marcellus Shale and the banjo's plangent tones, so redolent of rural parts of the US, wistfully underline just what's at stake.
Fox is now in Australia promoting the film and local campaigners, keen to point out the potential dangers of coal-seam gas mining, must be delighted to see him.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"A dozen Victorian country towns will be able to connect to piped natural gas under a $100 million state opposition election promise.
Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu on Friday announced a policy under which the government would offer councils access to a $100 million fund to connect towns to existing nearby pipelines.
 Mr Baillieu produced a list of 12 towns he said would be connected to gas under the scheme. They included Avoca in western Victoria, in the Labor-held marginal seat of Ripon in which he made the announcement.
Accessibility to gas would provide cheaper energy for households and businesses.
 The rollout of natural gas means a boost for these towns,  Mr Baillieu said.
Money from the fund would be distributed to councils after they tendered for access to the fund.
Asked how he could guarantee that towns such as Avoca would win in a tender process, the Opposition Leader said he could  assure  the dozen towns they would receive funding.
Meanwhile, Premier John Brumby has promised to scrap the state-owned forestry company VicForests and pursue a Tasmanian-style  accord  to manage native forest logging.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Royal Dutch Shell has won a long-awaited environmental approval for a revolutionary $10 billion floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project off Western Australia, adding momentum to the surging gas export industry.
Canberra's clearance for the Prelude project in the Browse Basin follows Environment Minister Tony Burke's approvals last month for two coal seam gas-based LNG projects in Queensland, worth about $40 billion.
 The tick was also given by the Queensland government this past week for a $35 billion venture by Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips.
The Prelude project may be the world's first floating LNG plant when it starts in 2016. Shell is due to give the final approval in the first half of next year.
The same Shell technology will be used at Woodside Petroleum's Sunrise venture in the Timor Sea, while the Bonaparte LNG venture between GDF Suez and Santos, and Thailand's PTTEP are also mulling floating plants off Australia's north-west coast.
The approval for Prelude comes with what Mr Burke described as strict conditions, including requirements for Shell to develop a detailed oil spill contingency plan and a strategy on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 This is a large-scale project that is using world-first technology,  Mr Burke said.  We can't risk getting it wrong. 
But he stopped short of forcing Shell to commit to specific carbon reduction measures or offsets, an issue that twice held up environmental consent for the venture earlier this year.
Shell started initial engineering work last year on Prelude and signed a contract in March with a French-Korean consortium for a special LNG processing ship.
Gas from the fields will be super-cooled to a liquid on board the vessel, which measures about 480 metres long by 75 metres wide, before being transferred at sea to special LNG carriers.
Shell Australia chairwoman Ann Pickard described the approval as  an important milestone .
The company has signed a contract to sell some LNG from the 3.6 million tonnes per year project to Japan's Osaka Gas, although Citigroup energy analyst Mark Greenwood said most of the rest was likely to go to Korea Gas.
Ms Pickard said that using the floating technology cut the project's cost and environmental impact as it removed the need for offshore compression platforms, long pipelines and onshore plants.
Because the Prelude ship will be built in South Korea, the project will also escape the severe squeeze on labour and construction capacity that is expected in Australia from the massive surge of investment in onshore LNG, as well as in iron ore and other resources.
Woodside is still to complete its Pluto plant in WA, Chevron is building its massive Gorgon LNG project while BG has started work on its Queensland plant.
Other LNG projects due to reach final investment decisions over the next year include plants by Santos and Origin Energy in Queensland.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"He is dubbed  the father of Woodside Petroleum  and he says Australia should act to ensure that the oil and gas company remains independent, as speculation about foreign interests continues to swirl.
Geoff Donaldson, the 97-year-old responsible for setting the company on its path from a penny stock to a $33Â billion force in Australia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry, said it was important for Woodside and its substantial gas assets to remain in Australian hands.
  I wouldn't want to see Woodside taken over by anyone, I want it to remain as Woodside,  Mr Donaldson told the Weekend AFR on Friday, noting that Australia's LNG industry had already become dominated by overseas oil and gas majors.
The $3.3Â billion sale on Monday night of a 10Â per cent stake in Woodside by Royal Dutch Shell at $42.23 a share, reducing the oil giant's stake to 24Â per cent, sparked a frenzy of speculation about who might be interested in acquiring Woodside.
It also revived memories of the extraordinary decision by then-treasurer Peter Costello in 2001 to block Shell's bid for Woodside on  national interest  grounds.
Mr Donaldson supported the 2001 decision, and said he expected the government to take a similar approach to any other international bids for Woodside.
His role in the formation of Woodside is legendary. A stockbroker at the time, Mr Donaldson, together with accountant Rees Withers, formed Woodside in 1954 to hunt for oil in Victoria, and became the company's chairman soon after listing. By 1962, with the company down to its last 70Â pounds, Mr Donaldson and Woodside pegged vast swaths of Western Australia's North-West Shelf.
At first, Woodside relied on funding from Mr Donaldson's own pocket and, as the company advanced, on the support of major international oil companies. As the influence and interest of the majors grew, Mr Donaldson prevented the company from being squeezed out by its bigger rivals.
He retired from the company in 1985, a year after the Woodside-Â­operated North-West Shelf project produced its first gas. His contribution to Woodside was recognised last year when the company's first LNG ship was named after him.
Mr Donaldson said he wasn't surprised to see Shell starting to exit Woodside.  As far as I'm concerned, Shell has always wanted to own its own things. It doesn't like to own parts of things,  he said.
His comments add to the chorus against a Woodside takeover, despite investors and analysts being divided over whether an offer will emerge. WA Premier Colin Barnett â€“ a vocal opponent to Shell's 2001 bid for Woodside when he was the state's energy minister â€“ has already called for the company to remain independent.
Whether or not there will ever be a bid to oppose has been the subject of much conjecture. While the $3.3Â billion of stock was snapped up by domestic and overseas institutional investors on Monday night, the company's shares have struggled to build on Shell's sale price despite the bid speculation. By Friday, the stock had closed at $43.08, still well below the $45.86 price before Shell's sale was announced.
Some investors believe that Shell must have sounded out third-party interest in the stake before deciding to sell â€“ an indication that no interest was forthcoming â€“ although the Weekend AFR understands Shell did not take such steps.
There is also conjecture over whether BHP Billiton, which has failed in three major deal attempts under chief executive Marius Koppers, would be interested in Woodside. While the upsides in the Woodside portfolio are substantial, so too are the potential headaches linked with their development. BHP Billiton, which runs its petroleum arm from Houston, Texas, is also known to be focusing on the Gulf of Mexico, where the BP oil spill has affected asset values.
Whatever happens, Mr Donaldson will be watching closely. He called chief executive Don Voelte  a good bloke , but said he understood why Mr Voelte was retiring.
 Don Voelte's done a good job, but I think it's time,  Mr Donaldson said.  After seven years in a job like that, it's time you got a bit of new blood.

Emergency Services Minister Steve Whan has defended exploratory drilling planned for the innerwest suburb of St Peters planned for the next few months.
  I think it is important to make the point that we are talking here about an energy source that could contribute to lowering the carbon footprint of people in the area,  Mr Whan told journalists in Sydney on Sunday.
Premier Kristina Keneally says her government has approved exploratory drilling at St Peters but no operation currently exists to mine gas in Sydney.
 It needs to be very clearly understood that an exploration approval is not an approval for mining,  Ms Keneally told journalists at the same press conference.
 If there was an application for such mining to occur, it would, of course, go through statutory processes which would, of course, involve community consultation. 
Macquarie Energy was given approval for the exploratory drilling that is due to begin in the next few months.

BRISBANE, Nov 14 AAP - Australian Greens leader Bob Brown has called for a moratorium on CSG (coal seam gas) mining before drilling starts in Sydney to allow for more environmental impact studies.
 Speaking to reporters in Brisbane on Sunday, Senator Brown said gas companies, which have done billion dollar mining deals with the Queensland government, need to be reined in and their mining practices scrutinised.
He said the inner Sydney suburb St Peters, near Mascot airport, could be heavily populated with CSG mining drill sites.
 The people of Sydney need to know the prospect of Queensland is for 40,000 drill holes in the Darling Downs,  Senator Brown said.
 We need to hear from the premier of NSW and the (Sydney) lord mayor how many drill holes are needed to extract gas from under Sydney and where are they going to be placed?
 Let's have some common sense into the marauding industry that blinkered politicians are ticking off because they don't understand the consequences that will be happening in the Darling Downs. 
Queensland Greens senator elect Larissa Waters said there are major concerns regarding the disposal of waste and water from mining CSG.
 The (Queensland) state government has taken some steps to ban the use of most toxic chemicals used in CSG extraction, but there's still huge questions marks about what else (chemicals) is being used by these companies and huge questions marks over the ground water and farm land climate change impacts.
 Yet our government, both state and federal, have charged ahead and given this industry a big tick despite these valid concerns.

 If we are serious about action on climate change we must address greenhouse emissions from power generation,  Mr Knox told a conference in Adelaide on Monday.
 Natural gas can play a major role in cutting carbon emissions, he told the Australian Institute of Energy National Conference.
 However, natural gas will not fulfil its full potential in cutting carbon emissions and providing energy security in the current policy environment,  Mr Knox said.
People recognise coal is high emissions, and renewables are getting political and financial assistance, he said.
 But gas, the only fuel that provides a baseload alternative to coal, using proven technology, is not getting any assistance at all.
 I am not advocating for special handouts, just good sensible policy that recognises we need to put a price on carbon if we are going to address the problem of climate change. 
Mr Knox said Australia's potential in the global LNG business was truly significant, and its impact on the global market was expanding.
 Right now we produce 20 million tonnes out of total world production of almost 250 million tonnes,  he said.
 But a third of all additional projected production by 2025 from projects sanctioned or proposed could come from Australia. 
He said not all the proposed projects will go ahead.

 But Ms Bligh insists her government is working to achieve the right balance.
 The places where the gas mining will take place and the coal, are places where it is suitable to explore these resources,  she told reporters on Monday.
 These are not in remote, pristine river systems like Cape York or the Gulf.
 So we want to get the balance right - economic opportunities for prosperity wherever it is appropriate and good strong environmental legislation.

 I certainly hope that Bob Brown will be backing the Queensland government when Tony Abbott's efforts to overturn the Wild Rivers legislation comes before the parliament.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"CLOVER Moore's City of Sydney council has denied any knowledge of a plan to drill an exploratory coal-seam gas well in the inner city and refutes claims the testing is linked to its sustainable energy plans.
The Greens yesterday demanded a moratorium on coal-seam gas mining as it was revealed that the NSW state government had granted permission for gas miner Macquarie Energy to begin drilling a test well in the suburb of St Peters, 5km from the CBD, in the City of Sydney local government area.
 The well is to be drilled within the Alexandria Landfill site in an industrial precinct of St Peters owned by the private company Dial-a-Dump Industries.
In an environmental review document lodged with the NSW Department of Industry and Investment, Macquarie Energy said it was ``seeking to establish a partnership with the City of Sydney'' as part of the council's tri-generation facility plans.
Ms Moore wants to install a network of more than 100 tri-generation turbines that could power 70 per cent of Sydney's electricity needs by 2030.
Trigeneration units are locally installed gas-fired plants that generate electricity for buildings and then capture the exhaust to heat and cool them.
In documents filed with the Australian Securities Exchange, Macquarie Energy, owned by Apollo Gas, has identified the trigeneration power plants as a major commercial market for any gas reserves identified during the St Peters coal-seam gas exploration.
But although the City of Sydney said the company had made ``inquiries about gas supplies'', it claimed to have been unaware of imminent plans to drill an exploratory well in St Peters.
``The City of Sydney has no relationship with Macquarie Energy,'' the council said in a statement yesterday.

``Sound and fury's not good enough, this is hurting people,'' he said yesterday. ``We want the Opposition to join the Greens to enable this legislation to go through before Christmas.''
The Greens also accused the state and federal governments of being blinded by money to allow the development of coal seam gas and coal mining.
While both major parties are unlikely to support regulating the banks, the proposed laws will further fuel the debate about interest rate rip-offs amid swelling bank profits.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"Ban on drilling urged
COAL seam gas exploration is occurring in NSW despite limited government understanding of the potential water quality effects of a controversial mining technique and with little or no involvement of the state's environmental regulators, the Greens say.
 The claims follow a  call for papers  through State Parliament that revealed recent internal emails of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water.
Senior staff wrote they did not know how many exploration licences had been issued or how many pollution incidents had occurred because  we are not involved and this [is] managed by [the Department of Industry and Investment] .
It is despite concerns overseas and in Queensland about the process of  fracking , in which a mixture of water, sand and chemicals is pumped deep underground to shatter rock and force coal seam gas to the surface, where it can be refined into natural gas for fuel.
Environment groups say fracking should be banned from around water sources, but the industry has insisted the practice is safe.
Documents tabled to Parliament include emails between the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water North West branch director Joshua Gilroy and the department's environment protection and regulation group co-ordinator and strategy manager Alison Cochrane.
They discussed the need to compile a file about coal seam gas exploration following media reports about industry activity.
Mr Gilroy wrote that the department  won't know  about total pollution incidents because it was not involved in the exploration licences.
He suggested staff check with Industry and Investment  to be certain exactly what chemicals are being used  in fracking.
 The majority of activity is under exploration licences across NSW, [the department] has very limited experience and involvement,  Mr Gilroy wrote in an email on September 28.
Older documents show Lucas Energy was given approval by the Primary Industries Department (now part of Industry and Investment) to conduct drilling, testing and  fracture stimulation  of five coal seam methane exploration wells in its exploration area in the Gloucester Basin.
The approval was given in line with a set of conditions, most of which were set out in a  review of environmental factors  report the company itself wrote.
AGL has since bought the Gloucester Basin assets.
Green MLC Cate Faehrmann said she had written to Premier Kristina Keneally outlining concerns the regulation of exploration licences appeared to be  deeply flawed  and that approvals lacked transparency.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"THE state government does not conduct any environmental assessment of exploration drilling for gas into coal seams despite increasing concern about its impact on aquifers and water supplies.
Documents tabled last week in Parliament show the government has little understanding of the possible environmental impact of coal seam gas exploration wells that are being drilled.
 The Sun-Herald disclosed at the weekend that the government has approved plans by an exploration company to drill a well searching for gas in St Peters. Neither Marrickville Council nor City of Sydney council had been advised of the plans.
Exploration drilling is being carried out for gas trapped in coal seams from the far north of NSW, around Casino, to around Gunnedah in the north-west, Singleton in the Hunter Valley and around Camden, south-west of Sydney. Coal gas methane is already extracted already at a number of sites on the southern coalfields around Appin, and at West Cliff, north of Wollongong.
Environmental concerns centre on the need to inject water and special chemicals, so-called fracking fluids, under pressure into many of the wells to force gas to the surface.
Among the tabled documents, an email by senior officials within the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water makes it clear the department has no knowledge of what is occurring, since it has no say in exploration activities.
 The majority of sites that use fracking currently are operating under exploration licences regulated solely by [Department of Industry and Investment] , which had no environmental or scientific expertise, the departmental officer noted.
Information obtained from one exploration company, Metgasco, detailing which chemicals would be injected into an exploration well was obtained by the government. The well was approved within days, with no assessment of the proposed injection process.
 These papers show the government has been nothing short of negligent in protecting the environment from this highly controversial and highly unregulated industry,  said a Greens MLC, Kate Faehrmann.
 I am alarmed at the lack of regulatory oversight in NSW that is allowing the burgeoning coal seam gas industry to run rampant throughout this state. 
Ms Faehrmann has written to the government calling for a moratorium on coal seam exploration drilling and extraction.
 The government must set tight environmental safeguards on the industry before projects are allowed to continue,  she said.
Metgasco told the government its drilling would have little effect on aquifers since all wells are encased in cemented steel casing  so there is no perceivable impact to ground water [as] a result of the fracture treatment .
The Premier, Kristina Keneally, said the approved drilling in St Peters by Macquarie Energy is only for an exploration well, and if production wells were to be drilled, the public would be consulted.
The mayor of Marrickville, Councillor Fiona Byrne, said:  I am very disappointed that approval for test drilling appears to have been granted without any kind of engagement with the local community ... I am extremely concerned about the lack of transparency.

Total LNG shipments into the nascent Middle East market, a region that only started imports last year through Kuwait, could rival imports into the closely watched Chinese market by the end of the decade, yet the opportunity is at risk of being missed, said Dr Fesharaki, a former energy adviser to the Prime Minister of Iran, and now chairman of consultancy FACTS Global Energy.
 Australian LNG ventures should be courting the various emerging Middle Eastern buyers, who are looking increasingly seriously at potential gas import sources to avoid burning crude oil for power generation, Dr Fesharaki said. Despite Qatar being the world's dominant LNG exporter, its Middle Eastern neighbours were keen to import from a variety of suppliers and geographical regions, he added.
 As they become long-term buyers they have to focus on projects they know,  said Dr Fesharaki, who expects Middle Eastern nations to start discussions on Australian supplies in the next year or two.  This gives an opening to Australian exporters. 
Dr Fesharaki expects Middle Eastern interests also to seek equity in Australian LNG projects.
Dubai is set to start importing LNG next year, followed by Bahrain in 2013, then Sharjah and Saudi Arabia, according to FACTS. Towards the end of the decade Saudi Arabia alone could be importing 10 to 20Â million tonnes per year, he said.
Dr Fesharaki will today present his outlook for Australian and world LNG markets at the Australian Institute of Energy conference in Adelaide, while Santos chief executive David Knox and Caltex Australia boss Julian Segal will also address the congress.

BRISBANE, Nov 16 AAP - The Queensland government has dismissed opposition calls to establish an independent watchdog to oversee the state's burgeoning coal seam gas (CSG) industry.
 The opposition wants a new statutory authority to oversee land and water regulations for CSG projects in the Surat and Bowen basins in southwest and cental Queensland.
Three new multimillion dollar CSG projects have been approved in Queensland in recent weeks, despite two recent contamination scares at existing CSG sites in the state.
The Greens say an alarming pattern is emerging and want a moratorium imposed on exploration licences for CSG mining projects until water supply and other risks are properly assessed.
Opposition mines spokesman Jeff Seeney said the CSG industry must be properly managed and called for the establishment of an independent Gasfields Land and Water Authority.
 The Gasfields Land and Water Authority should be a statutory authority with powers enshrined in legislation and a structure that ensures its independence from government and it should be empowered to make recommendations directly to the parliament,  Mr Seeney said.
 We need a gas fields, land and water commission that's made up of people who understand the Surat Basin, who understand the land and water issues. 
But Queensland Resources Minister Stephen Robertson said there were adequate safeguards in place to ensure mining companies don't harm farmland and water supplies.
 Legislation has been introduced to enable the independent Queensland Water Commission to monitor, model and advise on potential groundwater impacts,  Mr Robertson said.
He said the government was fulfilling an election promise to deliver thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment through the CSG-to-LNG industry.
Greens spokeswoman Libby Connors said the Opposition's proposal had come too late.
 Farming and residential communities on the Darling Downs needed the LNP to help them oppose these developments 12 months ago to ensure a moratorium was imposed,  she said.
 Now the approvals have already been given for these projects and we are being forced to witness an uncontrolled experiment on the Darling Downs. 
Last week, traces of the cancer-causing chemical benzene were found in water samples taken from Arrow Energy's Moranbah CSG project, west of Mackay last week.
Benzene was also found in eight wells at Origin and Australia Pacific LNG CSG wells last month.
And earlier this year, another gas extraction project - Cougar Energy's pilot underground coal gasification plant near Kingaroy - was forced to suspend operations after traces of benzene and toluene were found in nearby bores.

Three major projects, worth billions of dollars, have been given varying levels of approval to pipe coal seam gas from inland basins to new processing facilities near Gladstone and then export it.
 Hundreds of conditions have been placed on the approvals, but landholders are still worried about what the gas extraction activity will do to underground water quality and quantity.
The LNP Opposition in Queensland is calling for an independent Gasfields Land and Water Authority to be set up to have oversight of the coal seam gas industry.
Its natural resources and mines and energy spokesman, Jeff Seeney, says the authority should be appointed by State Parliament and be answerable to the parliament.
 It needs to be independent from the government and it needs to have an opportunity for local community leaders to serve on the authority itself, to be part of the authority,  he said.
 We have seen an enormous amount of new regulation, we've seen an enormous amount of conditions applied to these developments, and the important thing from here forward will be the administration and the monitoring of all of those regulations and all of those conditions. 
The Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy, Stephen Robertson, says there is no need for a new statutory authority of the kind being proposed by the Opposition.
 We already have an independent process in place and that is called the Co-ordinator General,  he said.
 It's the Co-ordinator General's role to independently assess major projects such as we've seen in the coal seam gas industry to ensure all stringent environmental, social and economic issues are adressed as part of the approval process.
 There is ongoing monitoring of aquifers, of environmental releases of water, right across the spectrum of environmental issues.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"A HOSTILE land battle is under way outside Chinchilla as a leading LNG company starts the development of intensive coal seam gas production facilities.
After fighting off Queensland Gas for more than three years, Brian and Carol Monk are about to be surrounded by development and the tree change they sought seven years ago will end. They have been told negotiations with Queensland Gas for the use of their land would start this week, but they have no idea what that means or what QGC wants.
 QGC has a proposal to build 334 coal seam gas wells in and around the bushland property the Monks share with their son and daughter-in-law on a huge section of land the company has named Jordan.
After 2014, the company plans even more development in the area to feed the LNG export plant in Gladstone.
The infrastructure it will build in the 145,000ha Jordan site is massive - the first real look at how intensive the coal seam gas industry will be in the Surat Basin since the $15 billion project won environmental and financial approval recently.
Each of the 334 wells has a construction footprint of 1ha, half of which will be immediately rehabilitated and the remainder progressively treated over the 20-year life of the wells.
``It's quite frightening,'' Mr Monk said. ``It's the devastation of the entire region and there's nothing you can do about it.
``There will be nowhere that does not have ponds and pipelines and wells and powerlines.''
According to QGC's environmental authority application, alongside the wells will be 80 frac ponds holding water released from underground during the process that releases gas. There will be seven huge storage dams over 32ha holding about 2000 ML of water, plus a major pond of 2000 ML. There will be borrow pits from which QGC will dig rock and gravel for access roads.
The application says the QGC's pits will be two metres deep over potentially 94ha and taking 1.86 million cubic metres.
A workers camp for about 900 people will be built, but the Monks have no idea where.
``There's nothing you can do to get away from this,'' Mr Monk said. ``I've told my son if he has a chance to get away he should take it. No sane person would want to raise their children next to a compressor station.''
QGC said it had consulted extensively with stakeholders since launching the project almost three years ago so people understood the project's scope, benefits and impacts.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"`Half of her face was pretty much gone. She was seriously burned. She was critically injured' - Hotel guest
CANCUN: A suspected gas explosion ripped through a Mexican hotel on Sunday, killing five Canadian tourists and two Mexican staff members while injuring 17 other people.
 Army and police personnel rushed to the blast and cordoned off the Grand Riviera Princess hotel in Playa del Carmen, on Mexico's Caribbean coast near the major resort city of Cancun.
The explosion killed ``seven people, five Canadians - four men, one woman - and two Mexicans who worked at the hotel'', Quintana Roo state attorney general Francisco Alor Quezada told Milenio television.
He said all the dead Canadians were tourists and the Mexicans included a tour guide and the hotel security chief.
He said the death toll rose to seven after one of the seriously injured died.
Alor Quezada said the 17 injured included seven Canadians, two of them in serious condition, and two US citizens, as well as eight Mexicans who worked at the hotel.
An early report said a gas tank exploded in the hotel kitchen but Alor Quezada said natural gas beneath the building had caused the explosion.
Decomposing organic waste in a 120-square-metre pocket beneath part of the hotel lobby was believed to have generated the gas build-up, he added.
He ruled out a premeditated attack as the cause of the blast.
Jeff Zimmerman, who was staying at the hotel, said the explosion opened a hole in the floor of the hotel lobby area, creating a crater.
Images of the blast uploaded to Youtube by hotel guests show a large, green hole in the hotel lobby peppered with rubble, with rescue crews and hotel employees helping the injured.
Zimmerman told Canada's CBC television he saw a seriously injured woman.
``Half of her face was pretty much gone. She was seriously burned. She was critically injured,'' he said.
Canadian consular officials arrived at the hotel to help tourists still staying there and Mexican authorities also contacted the US consulate, officials said.
Mexico's Caribbean coast welcomes about two million tourists every year, mostly from the United States, Canada and Europe. Playa del Carmen is about 90km from the major resort centre of Cancun.
Sunday's explosion evoked memories of a Molotov-cocktail attack in late August that killed eight people in a Cancun bar that had been targeted for extortion by organised crime. Cancun has seen an escalation of drug-related violence lately, with sporadic attacks by gunmen and gruesome discoveries of bodies in wells and graves.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"THE mining company planning to drill for coal seam gas in St Peters holds a gas exploration licence that covers nearly all of suburban Sydney and may expand its operations to other parts of the city.
Apollo Gas told the stock exchange the factor determining where it would drill was a report to be released in the next few weeks by the City of Sydney, outlining plans for gas-driven  trigeneration  energy plants.
  The master plan may indicate to Macquarie Energy numerous other sites rather than the St Peters site, as preferable for exploration activities,  the managing director, Andrew Mayo, said in a statement to the ASX.
Moves to expand beyond the proposal for one drill hole in St Peters would involve  broad community consultation , he said.
 Ultimately, it is the decision of the community and its leaders to decide whether or not to utilise this resource beneath the city.  There are big coal seams containing coal seam gas several hundred metres underground stretching from the city to the Hunter Valley.
Apollo Gas, via a subsidiary, Macquarie Energy, was granted petroleum exploration licence 463 in October 2008, allowing it to prospect across the region. The licence covers 3285 square kilometres - most of greater Sydney - from Kurnell to Gosford and west to Eastern Creek.
But the terms of the licence say Apollo must not drill or prospect within 200 metres of inhabited houses or within 50 metres of gardens or orchards, without written consent from the owners, the Department of Industry and Investment said. This means any drilling will probably be confined to less populated areas.
The St Peters site, an open area south of Sydney Park and alongside Alexandra Canal, is mostly surrounded by unoccupied industrial buildings. Drilling would involve a mobile drill rig, about the height of a telegraph pole, and trucks to move water and chemicals used in the drilling process in and out of the site. The government said the operation would be subject to  stringent environmental checks .
Environmental groups and the Greens said the development should be halted and a wider public debate take place.
 Any adequate coal seam gas process requires dozens, if not hundreds, of wells,  said the Greens MP Cate Faehrmann.  Sydney's inner city, being a built-up area, is obviously completely inappropriate as a coal seam gas drilling area. 
The director of the Total Environment Centre, Jeff Angel, said a public inquiry into coal seam gas extraction was needed.
 The gas companies and their coal mining allies have very ambitious plans in and around Sydney about which they have not told the public,  he said.

As gas and coalmining encroach upon farmland, people in regional areas are feeling abandoned by the Nationals â€“ and some are shifting allegiances, writes Anne Hyland.
 It's a betrayer's tale. How the Nationals, once the party of the land and its farmers, have become the party of business. It's a tale that the National Party disagrees with fiercely but it's one that's being told again by farmers in north-western NSW.
After years of watching health and educational services decline and battling the adversity of drought, farmers are now despairing of their latest challenge: the push by coalminers and gas companies onto agricultural land in an area known as the Liverpool Plains, some 450 kilometres north-west of Sydney.
The NSW government has estimated that two mining projects alone there could generate at least $230 billion for the national economy.
Mining and petroleum companies on and nearby the Liverpool Plains include Aston Resources and Eastern Star Gas, which are chaired by former Nationals leaders and deputy prime ministers Mark Vaile and John Anderson respectively.
Eastern Star Gas has proposed a pipeline that will run through the region.  I've got no doubt people like John Anderson and Mark Vaile will not be taking action that would adversely affect the livelihood of farmers and indeed food production capabilities of this region,  Warren Truss, leader of the federal Nationals, says.  We believe that the best farmland [should] be preserved for future agricultural use. Mining is important to our country but so is our nation's food supply. 
At least 20 companies have licences to explore for coal-seam gas, coal or other minerals in the Liverpool Plains; among them are BHP Billiton, Santos and China's biggest coalminer Shenhua Group. The Liverpool Plains supplies about 5 per cent of Australia's annual cotton production and 2 per cent of wheat.
Farmers such as Richard Heath, who has been approached by Santos to explore for coal- seam gas on his family's 5500 hectare farm, are asking why the Nationals, both at state and federal level, have not had a louder voice on the vexed issue of mining on the Liverpool Plains.
 There has been a little more open association with the Greens over the mining issue,  says Heath, a fourth-generation farmer, whose family property is 40 minutes' drive outside of Gunnedah. And less association with the Nationals, which he blames on their  sort of free market approach of letting the mining companies do what they need, which has really put a lot of people offside .
The mining issue is forcing many people in rural communities, the heart of the Nationals' constituency, into the arms of the Greens â€“ much to the delight of its national leader, senator Bob Brown.
Earlier this year, Brown told The Australian Financial Review that he had visited the Darling Downs in south-west Queensland prior to the federal election to listen to farmers' concerns about coal-seam gas exploration in that area. Some of the farmers told him that he was the only politician to have visited them.
What Heath and other farmers on the Liverpool Plains want is stronger political support and legislation to ensure their backyard does not become the next Hunter Valley in NSW or Darling Downs in Queensland: both areas where the coal and coal-seam gas industry has expanded rapidly under state Labor governments.
Farmers are concerned about coal-seam gas and coalmining because of the potential loss of prime agricultural land and the risk of contamination of underground water supplies. Controversy engulfed south-west Queensland's coal-seam gas industry in October when toxic chemicals were detected in Origin Energy's exploration wells.
The vice-president of the NSW Farmers Association, Fiona Simson,who also chairs the association's mining task force, says  regional people always expect somebody is going to be speaking up for them .
 They do expect the National Party, with its country links and regional focus, should be speaking up for them. They've been concerned, particularly with all this resource fuss hurry-up that the Nationals haven't been more vocal. 
Mark Vaile, chairman of Aston Resources, which has a coalmine north-west of Gunnedah, didn't respond to a request for an interview.
John Anderson, who chairs Eastern Star Gas, says his firm is not drilling near the fertile black soils of the Liverpool Plains but in an area further north known as Pilliga, where the land is of lower value and the work is unlikely to affect aquifers.  I do believe the National Party, both state and federal level, have been trying to find a sensible way through this,  says Anderson.  I continue to oppose anything that might disturb the black soil [Liverpool] Plains. 
Eastern Star Gas is facing opposition from farmers who have questioned the route of a proposed pipeline running through the Liverpool Plains, Simson says.
Anderson counters that Eastern Star Gas has created jobs.  It's already providing significant local employment,  he says.  We have to have people [in regional areas] to justify the education, medical and hospital services that country people and farmers want. We as farmers are facing a pretty uncertain energy future. You need energy to grow crops. It's very evident some time in the next decade we're going to see the end of cheap oil and the obvious answer is gas. 
The expansion of coal and coal-seam gas exploration has led to a backlash from townships and farmers, who fear health risks such as asthma and cancer from coalmining. The push into the area has also divided families: some want to sell and others want to stay.
Fields of yellow-flowered canola blanket the Liverpool Plains and flank both sides of the road that leads to Jim McDonald's 1400 hectare farm, almost an hour west of Tamworth. McDonald, 57, is also concerned about mining expansion in the area.
 Mining brings good things to a lot of people. A lot of wealth,  he says.  Our argument is there are places where mining could go and there are places where mining shouldn't go. We would rather sort that out before the miners come, rather than when miners come and we end up in the Hunter Valley or Darling Downs situation. 
While McDonald is concerned about potential damage to aquifers in the area that eventually feed into the Murray Darling basin and loss of fertile farming land to mining, he says the health issue is equally important.
He points to coal dust and toxin concerns that have already been raised by residents and medical professionals in the Hunter Valley.  I didn't think we had a society that did that any more,  McDonald says.
Heath, 40, who manages his family's farm with his three brothers and father, is not anti-mining.  We all use energy, so we can't stick our head in the sand about it. But if you can't be clever about locating mining and gas exploration so that it's not competing with agriculture, I don't think you're trying hard enough. 
Santos has the right to explore on Heath's farm under NSW government law, but has to negotiate with the family first to gain access to the property before it can begin exploring there. They have not come to an agreement, but Heath expects that Santos will be back.
The federal government is part funding a water study of the region so that all parties â€“ governments, resources companies and farmers â€“ are aware of the areas that could be affected by mining. The federal government's power to intervene is limited since exploration licences granted to the mining and petroleum industries are determined by the state government, Truss says.  The commonwealth has got very limited capacity to intervene. I know it has frustrated some farmers in the area who felt we should intervene. 
NSW opposition industry spokesman Duncan Gay, also a National, says his party had been meeting with the NSW Farmers Association and the NSW Mining Council as part of its work to propose a bill that would protect agricultural lands in the state deemed of  exceptional value .  The best outcome is to put proper process that will protect these iconic farmlands,  he says.  The hard bit is actually defining them [the iconic farmlands]. And we're working on the hard bits now. 
McDonald is ready to offer a starting point for what is valuable farming land.  A farmer thinks 'every little bit I do is valuable and must be protected at all costs'. It's probably not quite right. But there are some things that should be protected because they are a national asset not a farmer's asset. That black soil â€“ and its inherent fertility, water-holding capacity and the depth of the soil â€“ is a national asset. The depth of soil is really critical. You've got hundreds of years of use. The black soils don't occur across all of Australia. 
Simson says farmers' concerns are also exacerbated by the relatively short-term outlook for the use of the land by mining and gas firms.
 When you look at people who have been farming for four, five and six generations, and that the average gas well is 20 to 25 years and a coalmine is not much longer, it looks like short-term use of the land. Historically, we've got no reason to believe it's going to be productive afterwards because it never has been. 
She also wonders about the benefits to government.  If you look at coal-seam gas, they have a royalty holiday for the first five years of production [in NSW]. How can that be a state significant project? 
The federal and state Nationals' explanations that they are doing their best doesn't blunt Heath's criticisms, particularly of the party at a federal level.  People around here will never admit this, but at their core philosophy the Greens probably are more what the original National Party was about than the National Party these days, leaving aside environmental policy,  he says.
 The original intention of the National Party has been corrupted by its acceptance of economic rationalism in its extreme. Originally it was much more socialised about the bush and spreading wealth. But it's been the liberal-conservative embracing of market rationalism that has got a lot of people in the bush confused about what the Nationals are about. 
Anderson says farmers need to think carefully before throwing their lot in with the Greens.  I think it's the wrong direction. I would ask farmers to .â€Š.â€Š. recognise there are very real reasons for supporting the development of this energy source [gas]. Of course, we have to do it sensitively.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Greens say a Liberal National Party (LNP) proposal for an independent authority to oversee the coal seam gas industry will not prevent environmental damage.

 Queensland Greens spokeswoman Libby Connors says the LNP's proposal puts the cart before the horse.
 We would have liked to see the LNP join with the Greens and with the community groups in the call for the moratorium,  she said.
 The whole idea for the moratorium was for the industry to prove before it began that it could do the drilling and extract the gas without harm to the underground water systems.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE Opposition's promise of a new body to oversee coal seam gas and groundwater in central Queensland is ``too little, too late'', environmentalists and the Government claim.
The gas fields of the Surat and Bowen basins have become a battleground between coal and gas companies and farmers who see their livelihoods being destroyed by the massive planned energy projects.
 Although the Liberal National Party has been a strong supporter of the development, its state council has backed frontbenchers Jeff Seeney and Ray Hopper's plan for a Gasfields Land and Water Authority.
Mr Seeney said the authority should be appointed by Parliament and include landholders and councils to ensure communities across the gasfields have confidence in the administration of the regulations.
The plan comes after three coal seam gas projects were given State Government approval and one, Queensland Gas, gained financial approval in the past month.
Mr Seeney said: ``Monitoring the impacts of CSG extraction will be critically important as the industry rapidly expands and the oversight of that monitoring needs to be done by an independent authority with the necessary powers to take action quickly if it identifies the need.''
But Natural Resources, Mines and Energy Minister Stephen Robertson said the call for an independent body to oversee CSG projects showed the LNP had no understanding of the emerging industry.
``The LNP has finally had a policy idea, but it is 12 months too late,'' he said. ``They called for an independent body to oversee the impacts of the CSG to LNG industry - the Bligh Government entered this process 12 months ago.
``Legislation has been introduced to enable the independent Queensland Water Commission to monitor, model and advise on potential groundwater impacts.
``The Bligh Government is ensuring that no project is approved if it poses a risk to our environment.''
Queensland Greens spokeswoman Libby Connors said it was too little, too late.
``Farming and residential communities on the Darling Downs needed the LNP to help them oppose these developments 12 months ago to ensure a moratorium was imposed,'' she said.
``Now the approvals have already been given for these projects and we are being forced to witness an uncontrolled experiment on the Darling Downs.''

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"Coal seam gas outcry
SINGLETON Council has moved to prohibit the  cowboy industry  of coal seam gas exploration in the shire as some of its most beautiful pockets come under threat from gas exploration companies.
  With 17 open-cut coalmines, three power stations and I don't know how many underground coalmines, we're telling the NSW Government that coal seam gas exploration is just one thing too many,  Councillor Alison Howlett said.
The council will prohibit coal seam gas exploration and development in the Broke, Bulga, Hermitage Road and Roughit Lane areas in a new Local Environmental Plan for the shire.
Councillors unanimously agreed on Monday night that if Planning Minister Tony Kelly refused to agree to the prohibition, the council would make coal seam gas exploration categories of land use requiring council consent, full environmental assessment and community consultation.
 We had a full public gallery the other night, and all those people came out in terrible conditions because this is a real issue of concern in the community,  Cr Howlett said.
 We're in the same position with coal seam gas today that we were with black coal mining 30 years ago in terms of ensuring protections for the environment and the community.
 It's a cowboy industry because it's largely self-regulating, and we're calling on the NSW Government to take responsibility. 
The council resolution came after weekend revelations that the state's environmental regulators had little understanding of the potential environmental effects of the controversial mining technique, and little or no involvement or understanding of the extent of exploration.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"THERE is an element of deja vu to the proposal to explore beneath Sydney for coal-seam gas. Apollo Gas intends to drill a first exploratory bore beneath a disused industrial site in St Peters. The company, which has a lease to explore for gas over much of the metropolitan area, is following where others have gone before.
 The Sydney basin - from the Hunter to Batemans Bay - contains vast reserves of coal which have been known of since the 18th century. Coal was mined underneath Sydney Harbour, with the pithead in Birchgrove on the Balmain Peninsula, from the 1890s. But the mine was deep and dangerous; the quantity of coal effectively available was insufficient to sustain a profitable operation for long, and the mine closed in 1931. But subsequently the site was drilled for gas, which is present in economic quantities in Sydney basin coal seams. Gas was produced for some years reaching a peak of more than 11 million cubic feet in 1944, before declining quickly. The operation closed in 1950.
It is the choice of the site for the operation's surface workings, though, which is relevant to Apollo Gas's hopes today. According to the NSW Department of Primary Industries, the operating company's first exploratory drillings were in Cremorne. Once coal was found, it considered Kurraba Point, Balls Head, and two sites on Bradleys Head, one near Little Sirius Cove. But the owners of nearby property objected so strongly to the idea of a coalmine that the company was forced to move its mine head to working-class, industrialised Balmain. The attractions of a working harbour had clear limits in the 1890s; nimbyism was as potent a force then as now.
Coal-seam gas is claimed to be cleaner than coal: burning it produces about 57 per cent of the greenhouse emissions produced by coal for the same energy output. But some have questioned whether this is the whole story: far more emissions are produced in obtaining coal-seam gas, and through leakage. These, along with other emissions, reduce its environmental appeal. We have argued before that the process used today to extract gas from coal seams - hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - should not be used beneath Sydney's water reservoirs because it could contaminate groundwater flowing into them. The argument has less force in the metropolitan area, but other factors apply. Any company prospecting for coal-seam gas may well find, like its 19th-century coalmining predecessor, that it is hard to hide its surface operations, and when the neighbours find out about them, they object.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Santos chief David Knox has always maintained he can make a final investment decision on his flagship liquefied natural gas project in Gladstone without signing up another customer.
And it seems he may have to do just that, if global LNG guru Fereidun Fesharaki is right.
 The word from the well-connected consultant this week in Adelaide is the deal with the state gas giant, which involves a chunky 3.5 million tonnes per year sales contract, could still be another three to six months away from securing Korean government approval. And when it does come, it may not be for the full volume, which includes a 500,000 tonne joint purchase with Mitsubishi.
Without the certainty of the deal, which would also have the Korean utility taking up equity in the estimated $18 billion project, Santos faces having to raise capital at a bigger discount and potentially to bump up the size of the raising. To illustrate the sensitivity of the deal, Citigroup expects Santos to have to raise $1.5 billion if it sells down its stake in the GLNG project to 40 per cent but that rises to $2.4 billion if it keeps its existing 45 per cent. Others are predicting a lower amount.
However, going ahead with the final investment decision on GLNG without the Kogas deal would also raise questions about the level of certainty Santos needs over the Korean contract to hang onto its BBB+ credit rating from Standard & Poor's.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"ARROW BRISBANE, Nov 18 AAP - Follow-up tests have confirmed the presence of a carcinogen in three coal seam gas wells in central Queensland, Arrow Energy says.
Arrow last week said routine tests at the company's Moranbah gas project, west of Mackay, had detected traces of benzene in samples taken from three of 60 wells.
  The secondary tests have confirmed similar or lower levels of the BTEX group chemicals in all three wells (between one and three parts per billion),  the company said in a statement late on Wednesday.
The Arrow incident, and others like it, have forced the Bligh government to defend its safeguards for the coal seam gas industry.
The opposition has called for an independent watchdog to oversee the sector, but the government insists adequate checks and balances are in place to protect farmland and water supplies.
The BTEX chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene can be naturally occurring, but are also used by some coal seam gas operators to help fracture rock seams and to extract gas.
The chemicals can also be present in oil-based lubricants, diesel and petrol.
 Arrow has not used chemicals containing benzene, or any other members of the BTEX group of chemicals, in its fraccing (EDS: fracturing) fluids,  the company said.
 More detailed testing is already underway to identify if the chemical is naturally occurring or introduced by another means. 
Arrow said it had advised the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management and relevant land holders of the secondary test results.
It said any public health risk was  unlikely  due to the very low levels detected and the isolation of the affected wells.
 The water from these wells is managed in accordance with regulations governing coal seam water and is contained in lined, fenced ponds for treatment or removal,  it said.
 There are no registered bores within at least five kilometres of the three wells, and coal seam water is not used for feedstock.
 However, as a precaution, Arrow will conduct testing of water from bores closest to the area. 
Last month, benzene was also found in eight wells at Origin and Australia Pacific LNG's CSG wells.
And earlier this year, another gas extraction project - Cougar Energy's pilot underground coal gasification plant near Kingaroy - was forced to suspend operations after traces of benzene and toluene were found in nearby bores.
The Greens say an alarming pattern is emerging and want a moratorium imposed on exploration licences for CSG mining projects until water supply and other risks are properly assessed.
The National Farmers Federation also fears there have not been enough studies done to ensure groundwater won't be adversely affected by CSG and other similar operations.
Environmental concerns have led to some Queensland farmers locking their gates and refusing mining companies access to their land.

â€œMyself and Cr Hall had concerns whether the separation distance between the facility and nearby gas wells was appropriate.
â€œObviously gas and explosions don't mix.
â€œHowever, we had advice from our planners to approve it and we acted on that advice.â€?
Cr Jamieson said he believed a CSG well was located less than a kilometre away on a neighbouring property.
The site will include a storage facility for heavy explosives and ammonium nitrate, a key component used in ANFO â€˜fertiliser bombs'.
At least one Halliford resident has submitted a concern regarding the facility and Cr Jamieson said appeals to the decision were possible.
The facility will be fenced off by 2.8 metre high chain and barbed wire fence.
Cr Jamieson said he expected the explosives would be used in local mining operations.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"G asland, this year's winner of the Special Jury Prize at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, explores how millions of litres of water and nearly 600 chemicals have been used to retrieve gas from shale seams through ''fracking'' a process in which the gas corporations hydraulically fracture the ground to release natural gas deposits. When theatre director Josh Fox is offered $100,000 to lease his family's land in New York for drilling, he turns the money down and embarks on a journey across 24 states in America to investigate the situation. He discovers the devastating effects of ''fracking'', a technique which has posed serious health risks to local residents, their pets and livestock, and the wildlife. He makes the shocking revelation that people can set their home water supply on fire, and believes this is an issue that will resonate with Australian audiences. Fox found the transition from his directorial debut with the feature film Memorial Day to a documentary quite seamless.
  ''As a theatre director, there are similar strategies,'' Fox says. ''We are always researching topics and interviewing people. I didn't realise that would lend itself so much into making a documentary. Gasland was a detective story, and for me, the best way to portray my findings was in a documentary.'' Working without finances or a crew,
Fox did not let the pressure of managing his multiple roles affect his aim for the film. ''For me, writing and directing was the same thing. I had a vision for the project. But at times it was hard juggling the camera, the microphone and the steering wheel! I made the film without any money at all. There were times when I had friends who helped out, but nobody was able to clear their whole schedule. But the editor Matthew Sanchez helped a lot. He is really the co- creator of the project.'' Fox has been faced with various other obstacles. ''I tried to get the gas companies to sit down and have a talk. There are montages in the film, but that's not the whole story. We wrote tons of emails and tried to solicit them in many ways, and they wouldn't respond,'' he says. ''But in the end it's kind of better having the Congress addressing them instead.'' After receiving the award at Sundance, the film was given a platform through HBO in America, and Palace Films in Australia. But, he says, ''The main obstacle is whether I can hang in there and keep talking because the gas companies have enormous resources. It's been an endurance test.'' Fox has been caught in a recent media whirlwind, as the American gas corporations have been denying the film's claims. ''Big surprise there,'' he says. ''The gas
companies don't want people to see the movie!'' But he is determined to prove these corporations wrong. ''They are lying. It's very clear. It's so simple. On our website, gaslandthemovie.com, there is a link which goes into every single one of their attacks and how they are lying,'' he says. ''It's a smear campaign. An industry- sponsored attack machine that spends millions of dollars trying to attack this little film made by two or three people in the middle of the woods. It's David versus Goliath. They attack the people in the film, they attack the politicians who are trying to regulate the industry.'' For the most part, Fox had no trouble finding people willing to voice their experiences. ''In Dimock, Pennsylvania, the town had been completely taken
over and people were very concerned,'' he says. ''We had too many stories to choose from a testament to just how many cases of this there were.'' In Australia, there has been recent coal-seam gas exploration and development in NSW and south-east Queensland, and Fox is thinking of making an Australian sequel. ''Lots of people have contacted me on Facebook saying that people are in trouble in Australia. So I'm here to learn and to research. Obviously there
are a lot of parallels,'' he says. After speaking with some of our environmental leaders, Fox claims that this is the greatest environmental challenge facing Australia right now. ''Fracking is serious. And Australia is in the very early stage of what could be an explosion of industrialisation in a lot of areas,'' Fox says. ''I'm in contact with a resident in Queensland whose property has been invaded by the gas companies, and he's got water that he can light on fire as well. ''I think that the film has come at a time when a lot of these issues are exploding. The film will provide a base of knowledge on what is to come. It's a dramatic film and it's a great cinematic experience.'' Gasland screened at the Canberra International Film Festival and is released through Palace Films today.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"INDEPENDENT secondary tests have confirmed traces of potentially dangerous chemicals in water from three coal seam gas wells in the northern Bowen Basin in central Queensland.
Arrow Energy, owned by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina, announced on Monday last week that it had found minute traces of benzene in three of 60 water samples taken in the northern basin.
 It said yesterday the secondary tests had confirmed similar or lower levels of BTEX group chemicals - benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - in all three wells.
Arrow said it had not used chemicals containing benzene, or any other members of the BTEX group, in ``fraccing fluids'', used to fracture coal to release the gas within it.
And it said more detailed testing was under way to identify if the chemical was naturally occurring or introduced by another means.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Woodside Petroleum is believed to be closing in on a deal to source six liquefied natural gas cargoes worth up to an estimated $160 million from Malaysian gas giant Petronas as it looks to cover sales commitments from its delayed Pluto LNG project.
Woodside is set to announce the results of its latest budget and schedule review of the $13 billion Pluto project in the next 10 days, with analysts expecting to see an extra $200 million to $700 million added to the project's budget.
 The timing of first production is also expected to be pushed out towards mid 2011. Woodside had originally hoped to have the project in production by January 2011, and had already delayed first production to the end of March.
The looming delays mean Woodside will have to source other LNG volumes to meet its agreed sales commitments from Pluto.
In its 2008 annual report, Woodside cited an agreement with Petronas whereby the companies would offer one another back-up LNG cargoes in the event of unexpected maintenance or production delays.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said Woodside was likely to call on the agreement given the delays at Pluto.
 The market's buzzing that they are exercising an option agreement with Petronas for circa six cargoes,  Ms Brookman said.
Exercising the agreement would leave Woodside needing to tap LNG spot markets if it encounters any further unexpected delays at Pluto next year. Current LNG spot prices are believed to be higher than the contract prices in place at Pluto.
Woodside recently admitted it would need to dismantle and rebuild gas flaring towers at Pluto after the existing towers were found to be non-compliant with cyclone resistance specifications.
The company recently exercised an option to extend an accommodation services agreement with Fleetwood Corp at Pluto by another six months to mid-2011.
Macquarie analyst Adrian Wood has been modelling a 5 per cent blowout in the Woodside budget and a delay to mid-2011. Woodside closed down $1.21 to $40.95 yesterday.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"TRACES of toxic chemicals have been found at a  fracking  operation to extract coal seam gas - the third time this year that gas producers have detected contamination at a drill site.
Arrow Energy confirmed that benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene - together known as BTEX - had been found in wells at a gas site east of Mackay, Queensland.
 In NSW documents obtained from the Department of Industry and Investment show that a coal seam gas drilling site near Lismore, run by the Sydney company Metgasco, was permitted to use fracking after supplying a generic list of hazardous materials safety guidelines.
Emails between department staff and Metgasco show that testing for coal seam gas using fracking can go ahead without approval being sought or required from the Environment Department.
The practice of fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting a mix of water, sand and chemicals underground to force gas to the surface.
Environmental and farming groups have questioned the safety of the technique after reports from the US suggesting fracking chemicals, including BTEX, have contaminated drinking water supplies.
Coal seam gas companies and the industry body the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association say fracking has never been known to contaminate drinking water.
In Queensland Arrow Energy will test water bores in the surrounding area as a precaution, even though the traces, first suspected two weeks ago, are small.
It said BTEX was not used in its fracking chemicals and the contaminants might be traced to diesel used at the drilling site.
In October BTEX was discovered in eight wells at drill sites run by Origin Energy about 300 kilometres west of Brisbane. Earlier this year an underground coal gasification project near Kingaroy, Queensland, was temporarily shut when benzene and toluene were detected.
The NSW Greens are calling for a moratorium on coal seam gas extraction and a public inquiry into its long-term effects.
Emails obtained during a call for papers in the NSW upper house show the Environment Department seeking information about fracking, apparently sparked by recent reports in the Herald.
 The majority of activity is under exploration licences across NSW, [the department] has very limited experience and involvement,  one exchange reads.  I think that a briefing on [fracking] fluids really needs to come from [the Department of Industry and Investment] and/or industry. 
Cate Faehrmann, a Greens MP, said the department appeared to do little more than apply a  rubber-stamping exercise  to fracking applications.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"OIL and gas companies have slammed Julia Gillard's plans to move onshore petroleum production to the national offshore tax regime, saying it will damage the industry and put them at a disadvantage to offshore rivals.
US oil giant Conoco Phillips has called on the government to ring-fence Queensland's giant coal-seam gas projects from the scheme, because the multi-billion investments were valued on state royalty regimes.
 Australia's biggest onshore gas producer, Santos, said moving its Cooper Basin and Queensland coal-seam gas projects to an offshore regime would put it at a distinct disadvantage because state royalties, although they would be refunded later, would immediately eat into early cashflow. Miners' objections to the new tax regime have been well canvassed.
But the release yesterday of submissions to the tax policy transition group has for the first time revealed petroleum industry anger against the Gillard government's plan to move onshore oil and gas to the offshore petroleum resource rent tax scheme (PRRT).
Beach Energy, which produces oil in the onshore Cooper Basin in South Australia and Queensland, said the changes would cut employment and exploration and development, meaning regional growth would be affected.
``The changes proposed will damage our industry, have a consequent negative effect on our profitability and are therefore not in the overall best interests of the Australian people,'' the company said.
Conoco Phillips Australia president Todd Creeger said ``grandfathering'' existing CSG-to-LNG projects would lessen new risks associated with large energy projects in Australia.
``The value of these projects, and in particular Conoco's original investment in the APLNG project (its joint venture with Origin Energy) was determined not only on the basis that PRRT did not apply, but also with consideration to Australia's historic fiscal stability and low sovereign risk,'' Mr Creeger said.
In its submission, Santos, which is also planning a CSG-to-LNG project, said the inequity in having dual federal and state tax systems needed to be addressed.
``On-shore projects are left with a hybrid ad valorem/profits based tax regime that features the harsh aspects of each regime without any of the offsetting benefits,'' Santos said.
``The uplifting of uncredited royalties does not compensate for this additional tax.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"A LEADING soil scientist has questioned the value of environmental impact statements attached to Queensland's billion-dollar coal and coal-seam gas projects.
Peter Dart, from the University of Queensland's School of Land, Crop and Food Sciences, warns mining will destroy top-grade agricultural soil despite assurances from Premier Anna Bligh and Natural Resources Minister Stephen Robertson.
 ``While the coal-seam gas environmental impact statements address biodiversity and aquifer issues, they do not deal with soil management,'' Dart says.
He also points the finger at coal miners.
He says the expansion of New Hope's Darling Downs coalmine at Acland - hailed as ``good news'' by Bligh - will also destroy prime agricultural land. It is simply not possible to rehabilitate top quality soils, he says.
He also believes there is not enough hydrological research to measure the impact of mining on aquifer recharge land.
Vital irrigation water may be lost for good, he warns.
The Australian Society of Soil Science is staging a public forum at 6pm on Monday at the University of Queensland's Abel Smith Theatre to discuss the environmental implications of the state's coal-seam gas projects.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"FEATURE
Hunter residents fear the damage from an onslaught of coal seam gas exploration outweighs the environmental benefits of the final product, writes FRANCES THOMPSON.
 GROWING opposition to coal seam gas is going national with Hunter communities playing their part in a wave of protest along Australia's east coast.
Much like the web of tracks that connect the fast-spreading networks of wells in Queensland and NSW, farmers, winegrowers and ordinary residents in the Hunter have joined a national alliance that wants a moratorium on coal seam gas [CSG] exploration and increased regulation.
Recently, representatives from Queensland, NSW and Victoria from industries such as wine and tourism and community and environment groups, met at Broke in what Hunter Valley Protection Alliance spokesman John Thomson said was the first united move in Australia against coal seam gas.
 It [the campaign] has stopped being individual communities,  Thomson said.  We are united and we are pushing at all levels of government. 
In the Hunter, AGL appears to dominate the search for coal seam gas - although mining giant Xstrata is extracting gas for power generation at Teralba.
Thomson said it was easy to unite public opinion because the environmental and community issues were the same, no matter where the wells were sunk.
 People start doing research on the web and there is heaps of information and that scares the bejesus out of them.
 Before you know it you've got community action,  Thomson said.
AGL's Hunter gas project area extends from Newcastle to Scone and Merriwa. The company has drilled 22 cores and wells in the Broke/Bulga area. In Broke, five core holes were sunk as well as two test wells.
Its Gloucester project, centred on Stratford, includes 110 well sites in stage one and a pipeline to the company's proposed $300 million liquefied natural gas storage plant at Tomago, which has been declared  critical infrastructure  by the NSW government.
Singleton councillor Alison Howlett said the coal seam gas industry was under-regulated.
 It is our big challenge to get this right,  Howlett said.  We have learned to live with coalmines but [with gas] we are in a watershed moment. It is like being back in the early 1980s. 
This week, Howlett moved successfully at council for Singleton's new Local Environmental Plan to prohibit coal seam gas exploration and development in parts of the local government area, including Broke.
If the NSW planning minister vetoes that move, Singleton council resolved to make coal seam gas exploration a land use requiring council consent, robust environmental assessments and community consultation.
A similar resolution was moved by Cessnock City Council in October.
Thomson and Howlett say AGL's operations in the Broke area have received minimal assessment by government authorities and the criticism is backed up by documents tabled last week in NSW Parliament.
The documents show the state government has little understanding of the possible environmental impact of coal seam gas exploration, including wells proposed for inner Sydney.
Officials within the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water had no knowledge of what was occurring, since it had no say in exploration activities, a staff email among the documents stated.
University of Newcastle water expert Professor Garry Willgoose, who was appointed by the government to provide independent expert advice on AGL's activities at Broke, said the biggest problem with coal seam gas was the lack of unbiased advice, independent of exploration companies.
 In the old days government departments had the technical skills to provide this. There has been so much deskilling of the public service,  he said.
He said government departments did not know who should be responsible for regulating the industry.
 The community wants some sort of reassurance,  Willgoose said.
AGL describes the guidelines on exploration in NSW as strict and strong.
Exploration wells are managed by Part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act and are approved by the planning minister.
Ruining rural landscapes and  fracking  are the biggest environmental fears of coal seam gas.
Fracking is the injection of water and chemicals under pressure into the seams to force gas to the surface. The process can create large amounts of contaminated water.
Two wells at Broke have been fracked.
Two coal seam gas companies had to cease operations in Queensland recently when cancer-causing BTEX [benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene], used in the fracking process, were detected in wells.
AGL said it did not use BTEX chemicals.
Gas industry representative organisation, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association [APPEA], said coal seam gas would provide the clean and reliable energy industry and consumers wanted.
 NSW has to find a new way to keep the lights on, while reducing [carbon] emissions,  association chief executive Belinda Robinson said.
Gas-fired power stations emitted up to 70 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions than existing coal-burning plants, the association said.
 Yet in NSW, gas only delivers about 3 per cent of electricity and NSW only produces 4 per cent of the gas it consumes,  Robinson said.  In 2030 NSW will need about 60 per cent more electricity than it does today. 
Most of the gas NSW uses is conventional natural gas (from underground reservoirs) from the Moomba field in South Australia and Bass Strait.
AGL documents state its water tests show there is no drainage or connectivity between the coal seams and the extensive Wollombi Brook aquifer relied upon by agricultural users.
Willgoose confirmed AGL's assessment, based on results of flow tests to simulate gas extraction conducted over six months this year.
 You can never give a 100 per cent guarantee that there is no leakage between aquifers,  Willgoose said.
Willgoose said the highly disturbed geology of Bulga, where there are many coalmines, is an important consideration.
 The Broke results have been pretty good but you can't say it will be the same in Gloucester or Bulga,  he said.
AGL's website says coal seam gas extraction is compatible with the Hunter's tourism and wine industries.
WHY COAL SEAM GAS IS DIFFERENT
COAL seam gas [CSG] is mostly methane, attached to what's known as cleats on the surface of the coal.
CSG can be extracted when pressure on the coal is reduced, usually by removal of the water that holds the gas to the coal.
Conventional gas is in large reservoirs, in permeable rock formations, capped by mud or other material.
Extraction of CSG requires numerous small wells, often only several hundred metres apart, along a seam.

Bow Energy says it will have four pilot projects pumping and testing early in 2011 at its Blackwater coal seam gas field in the Bowen Basin, Queensland.
 Preliminary results are expected late in the first quarter of 2011.
 In addition to increasing our 3P reserves target to 6,200 petajoules, our primarily focus will be to deliver commercial gas flows across multiple gas fields, this being a prerequisite in achieving our 2P reserves target of 1,250 petajoules by the end of next year,  chairman Howard Stack told the company's annual general meeting on Monday.
Mr Stack said following a $48.4 million capital raising in November, Bow had the funds to target delivery of commercial gas flows by the end of 2011.
Bow will also target early cash flows from electricity sales and gas reserves of 6,200 petajoules 3P and 1,250 petajoules 2P by end of 2011, he said.
Bow's capital raising was supported by Australian and international institutional investors.
The company will also raise $30 million via a share purchase plan for shareholders.
 Gas is already part of Australia's cleaner energy future, and I believe Bow is in an excellent position to capitalise on this rapidly growing trend, and in the rapidly growing internationally demand for LNG exports to the Asia Pacific region,  Mr Stack said.

 What we would prefer to see rather than blanket bans everywhere, we believe people want some certainty about the development of these industries,  chairwoman of the Association's mining taskforce, Fiona Simson said.
 Cessnock and Singleton Councils have passed resolutions calling for productive farmland including vineyards to be protected from the emerging industry.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Farmers in southern Queensland are increasingly concerned about the rapid expansion of the state's coal seam gas industry.
It is estimated up to 40,000 wells could be dotted across the Surat and Bowen Basins over the next two decades.
 But the landholders say not enough is known about the long-term impacts of the extraction process, and they are worried about what it will do to the quality of water and soil.
Three major coal seam gas projects have been given conditional approval in recent weeks.
The wells will extract gas from the Surat and Bowen Basins, pipe it to Gladstone in central Queensland, and convert it to liquefied natural gas for export.
Southern Queensland farmer and Basin Sustainability Alliance chairman Ian Hayllor has raised questions about the approval processes.
 Major projects have been approved ... the gas companies have got the financial approval to proceed,  he said.
 These projects are going ahead, yet the Government is still to fully understand its long-term impact. 
Mr Hayllor joined scientists, environmentalists and industry representatives at a forum in Brisbane last night to discuss the emerging industry.
He says he cannot get an answer about what effect water pumped out of the gas wells will have on salinity or underground aquifers.
 Basically the landholders are concerned with a lack of understanding of this industry,  he said.
 It's just exploding onto the scene - we're talking about the extraction of 350,000 megs a year out of the Great Artesian Basin, 40,000 wells, and millions of tonnes of salt.
 The Government just says 'we're going to adopt an adaptive management approach to manage this industry'.
 We're just scared - we are frightened that the industry is so big, the impacts could be so great, that it may not be able to be stopped. 
Mr Hayllor says he is worried that chemicals from the wells could contaminate water.
But the director-general of Queensland's Department of Environment and Resource Management, John Bradley, has tried to allay fears.
 We've got a regulatory regime which is tougher than any in the world in terms of its impact on coal seam gas,  he said.
 We see the banning of evaporation ponds, unlike the approach taken in the United States.
 We also see the stringent use of accumulative models to assess groundwater impacts, [so that] we'll be able to predict in advance what the impact on groundwater is going to be. 
Ross Dunn from the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association says coal seam gas extraction is safe.
 We have no more interest in contaminating the land than the next person does,  he said.  We want to make sure what we do is environmentally acceptable,  he said.
However, despite the State Government and industry assurances, Mr Hayllor remains unconvinced.
 We're working really hard to ensure that this industry doesn't leave a legacy of destruction for future generations,  he said.
 It's a 20 or 30-year industry in our area.
 It'll move on to other areas or other countries and we're not prepared to stand back and see our groundwater destroyed.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"It's designed to withstand wind speeds of 375 kilometres an hour, 27 metre waves and a one in 10,000 year weather event.
Royal Dutch Shell says its proposed floating Liquefied Natural Gas processing plant off Western Australia's North West Coast is specially designed to cope with weather conditions worse than a category five cyclone.
 After receiving Federal Government approval, the oil company now has the go ahead to establish the world's first floating LNG plant.
A company spokesperson says new design features will be installed to insure disasters don't occur.
 The facility will be moored by four sets of six chains; with each chain secured to the sea floor by a suction pile the size of a small house and the sheer size and 600,000 tonne weight of the plant will also increase stability. 
A Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Western Australia, Mark Cassidy, says stability is fundamental.
 I think what's interesting about the floating LNG is that it's never been done before in that magnitude and therefore the anchoring systems will need to be designed to make sure it stays on location. 
This is particularly crucial in the event of a cyclone.
Hundreds of offshore oil and gas production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico were severely damaged when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the region.
The two hurricanes caused the largest number of destroyed and damaged platforms and pipelines in the history of oil and gas operations in the Gulf.
Now, the impact cyclones could have on offshore facilities off North West WA is to be studied by a team from Woodside and UWA after a federal grant of more than $500,000.
Team leader Professor Greg Ivey says it's important to understand the potential risks involved.
 The industry is forever moving into new areas as they're exploring unknown parts of the ocean and we would like to be able to provide them with forecasting capability to know what effects cyclones are going to have in the future over wide ranging areas. 
Professor Cassidy is hopeful the study will avoid disasters such as those in the Gulf of Mexico from occurring.
 If we can predict the impacts a large cyclonic event can have, we can ensure our platforms, pipelines and floating LNG type arrangements are stable and won't be damaged during severe weather patterns. 
He says the study will help deal with some of the engineering challenges posed by the Gorgon Gas facility off the Pilbara coast.
 With the Gorgon project, they're bringing gas back from 1,300 metres underwater using a sub-sea pipeline that needs to cross the continental shelf and up onto the shelf and then towards Barrow Island.
 Gorgon is in the design phase, so it's using these types of methods in its design, so we can try and make sure the risk or chance of a disaster happening is minimal and that it's within tolerable limits that society sets. 
The team will place instruments in the path of moving cyclones to measure various underwater disturbances.
Professor Ivey says they will be placed about 500 metres underwater, north west of Port Hedland.
 We will leave those in there during the cyclone season, and then we will retrieve the data, which will have recorded the intensity of the currents, the intensity of the turbulence and the size of the offshore waves. 
He is hopeful the research will help offshore oil and gas engineers design cyclone proof structures.
 No one has really carried out this research before, and we would like to be able to give engineers the forecasting ability to design structures which are safely built and operated in the future.
 Essentially we're providing the science that the engineers will then use to design the sorts of infrastructure that they will need to underpin the ever increasing number of offshore developments. 
Professor Cassidy says the research will be integral to designing safer offshore structures.
 For engineers working on the North West shelf they need to predict how big the storms will be and how much load the structures must be able to take.
 This is so we can design a structure that can withstand the strength of the load that will be imposed on the platform or the pipeline and make sure it won't leave its mooring and result in a disaster. 
He believes it will filter into all new offshore developments.
 I think these methods will be used to design the Browse Basin hub, Gorgon gas precinct and Shell's proposed floating LNG plant.
The study will be conducted over the next two summer cyclone seasons.
Professor Ivey says the research is setting a worldwide precedent.
 Very few measurements have been made which record the impact of the ocean during cyclones in any part of the world.
 Hopefully this study gives engineers confidence as they are asked to design infrastructure to operate in unknown waters.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Queensland Government is setting up what it calls an  enforcement unit  in a bid to allay some of the farmer and environmental concerns surrounding the coal seam gas industry the state's south.
It's estimated that over the next 20 years up to 20,000 wells could be drilled in the Surat and Bowen Basins to supply gas to export facilities in Gladstone.
 In the face of calls for a moratorium on the activity and threats from landholders that they'll lock their gates to keep the crews out, the Premier today announced the formation of a 36-member enforcement unit.
Anna Bligh says it will include environmental and groundwater experts, petroleum and gas safety specialists and people specialising in land access issues.
 This unit will act as a one-stop shop for any safety, land access or environmental concerns,  she said.
 These staff will be based out on the ground ... on the industry frontline to respond quickly to issues as they arise. 
So far, three major projects have been given some level of government approval, but only one has completed the process and had corporate capital committed to it.
Robert Walker, the CEO of the farmer lobby group AgForce, says the formation of the unit is a step in the right direction, but it's 12 to 24 months too late.
 We have an industry out there struggling to compete and struggling to battle the massive influx of exploration and mining,  he said.
 But this announcement will hopefully level the playing field between primary production and mining. 
As part of the package announced in State Parliament today, AgForce is getting $3.5 million over three years for a program which helps landowners negotiate with gas companies.
 There is a dearth or lack of knowledge within the industry about what producers rights are when someone knocks on their front door,  Mr Walker said.
 We need that funding to get people on the ground to assist our people in their legal rights and legal battles with these mining companies.
 In taking this money, in no way do we condone what the government or mining companies are doing. 
AgForce is still calling for a moratorium on the development of the coal seam gas reserves.
Today a motion was tabled in the Queensland Parliament today calling for a moratorium.
Queensland MP Aiden McLindon says nothing further should happen until it's certain there'll be no adverse health or environmental impacts.
He challenged the LNP Opposition to support the motion and farmers, and after a heated exchange was asked to leave the chamber for an hour.
Previously, the LNP's mines and energy spokesman Jeff Seeney said the issues can't be wished away.
 We have to deal with the issues, deal with the problems as they arise and make sure that we do protect prime agricultural land. 
There's not likely to be a debate on the moratorium motion until next year.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,4,"Dalby civil construction company, Ostwald Bros has landed a multi-million dollar contract as part of the coal seam gas projects already approved for the region, with local businesses expected to feel the flow on effect.
While the state and federal governments have only just approved QGC's Liquefied Natural Gas project in the Surat Basin, Ostwald Bros has already been awarded the contract valued at up to $60 million.
 The decision has been welcomed by Western Downs Regional Council Mayor Ray Brown, who said the contract was a major boost to the local economy.
Ostwald Bros CEO Brendan Ostwald said the company employed 400 people and would need to increase its workforce to more than 500 within the next six months.
â€œOur appointment proves QGC are committed to sourcing and spending locally,â€? Mr Ostwald said.
The world's first liquefied natural gas plant will be built at Gladstone after the $15 billion project won environmental and financial approval recently.
Cr Brown said that Ostwald Bros was renowned for using local workers and local suppliers.
â€œThis contract will have an accumulative impact on our business houses and the local economy,â€? Cr Brown said.
â€œThe whole of the region will feel the impact of the project being awarded to a local civil construction company.â€?
Ostwald Bros has the largest privately owned scraper fleet in Australia and the company intends to inject an additional $7 million into purchasing additional plant and equipment to meet project requirements.
The fleet expansion has resulted in an increase in the ranks at their Dalby servicing centre.
â€œThe LNG Project and the expansion of a local company like Ostwald Bros will have a ripple effect on the Bowen and Surat Basin communities,â€? Mr Oswald said.
â€œOstwald Bros growth brings new employment opportunities, which means more people moving into towns in the region and in turn will boost bush businesses and services.
â€œWe employ diesel fitters, plant operators, engineers through to administration.
â€œWe will be putting on additional apprentices and giving greater opportunities for local training which is vital for rural Queensland.
â€œWe buy locally whenever possible and engage the services of local businesses.â€?
He said money spent with Ostwald Bros will stay in rural Queensland which is good news for locals with big business finally moving back to the bush.
Ostwald Bros will start work immediately and has already started advertising new positions.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"THE colourless, odourless, tasteless but highly flammable gas that's keeping rescuers at bay is the key component of the natural gas that fires ovens, barbecues and power stations.
The gas, methane, is not deadly if inhaled but it can cause suffocation by reducing the amount of oxygen in the air. In a scientific twist, it's created by the same processes that produced the coal the 29 trapped miners were seeking when the gas exploded, trapping the men 150m below the surface.
 Rescue efforts to free 33 men trapped in the collapse of the San Jose mine in Chile in August could start immediately because it was a copper-gold mine.
Unlike those elements, methane, CH4, is a form of hydrocarbon. Like coal, it's formed from dead organic material, heated under enormous pressure.
It's trapped by water and pressure in a coal-seam or petroleum reserve, and released by drilling.
The amount of methane released depends on the depth and grade of the coal. Essentially, the deeper the coal or the higher the grade, the greater the volume of methane released.
``Methane only requires a low concentration of a few per cent in air to be flammable,'' said Monash University environmental engineer Gavin Mudd. As little as 5 to 15 per cent methane in air is highly combustible, ``but there does need to be an ignition source. Common causes can be equipment, especially electrical equipment, or it can be metal sparks, static electricity or other source,'' he said. ``At present we have no idea (which it is) in this case.''
Mining engineer Christopher Bise, of West Virginia University in the US, told the Los Angeles Times that the traditional way of managing methane was to ``overwhelm it with fresh air'' using massive exhaust fans.
Because a single electric spark can ignite the gas, the use of robotic exploration units -- as reportedly being considered in the Pike River mine -- is risky, according to industrial safety expert David Cliff. ``They cannot be used in flammable atmospheres. They usually trail a cable for control and communications, and these are prone to damage,'' said the University of Queensland associate professor.
``Robots in general in the past have seldom worked,'' he said.
``They're not able to cope with the level of damage found in the mines, and are not flame-proof or intrinsically safe.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"AN area stretching from Toowoomba to Roma has been declared a no-go zone for the mining industry after eight farming and environmental groups launched a campaign to urge farmers to lock their gates to protect agricultural land.
Coal seam gas companies are starting to watch nervously the growing threat from activists and farmers who have said they would go to jail before allowing the $50 billion industry to use their land.
 To date, the threat has been low key but the coalition of farming and environmental groups yesterday launched their ``lock the gate'' campaign at Parliament House.
Friends of the Earth organiser Drew Hutton said environmental law was weighted in favour of mining interests.
``This is the most radical transformation of rural Queensland since the 19th century,'' he said.
Farmers could be jailed for refusing to pay any court-imposed penalty, rather than going to jail for refusing miners access to their land.
The farmers said mining companies had extraordinary rights to enter land for exploration and mining, which disrupted farm operations and could exclude land from production.
Gas companies are yet to explain how they would deal with farmers who locked their gates.

 FerrAus-BHP talks FerrAus has held talks with a subsidiary of BHP Billiton after the mining giant last week took the emerging producer to court over failed negotiations for a rail haulage deal. BHP Billiton took action in the West Australian Supreme Court after FerrAus said it would ask for an independent expert to be appointed to decide on a rail haulage agreement. FerrAus wants to haul iron ore from its Pilbara project using BHP Billiton's Mount Newman rail line but has not been able to secure a deal.
Ostwald adds jobs A contract worth up to $60 million proves that proponents of a $15 billion coal seam gas project will promote local businesses, a Darling Downs company says. Dalby-based Ostwald Bros has won the contract for the use of its fleet of earthmoving scrapers and will boost its workforce from 400 to 500 in response.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The dramatic surge in shale gas production in the US has prompted Macquarie Group to link up with privately owned Freeport LNG for a $US2 billion liquefied natural gas export venture on the Gulf coast.
The partners plan to jointly develop a gas liquefaction and LNG export project at Freeport LNG's existing gas import terminal on Quintana Island, Texas, tapping into increased domestic gas supplies in the US to export to higher-priced energy markets in Asia and Europe.
 Rapidly rising output of unconventional gas, primarily shale gas, has transformed the US domestic gas supply balance, cutting the country's demand for imports and opening up opportunities instead for exports.
The change means that the US, which only a few years ago was regarded as a potential important import market for Australian LNG, is now shaping up as a competitor for customers in Asia.
The Freeport terminal will be the second in the US to turn itself from an import-only or re-export facility into one that can also liquefy domestic gas supplies for export by tanker.
Private company Cheniere Energy earlier this year announced plans to build the first LNG export plant in the US for 40 years. Its Sabine Pass, Texas, plant is scheduled to start LNG exports by 2015, about the same time as the Macquarie/ Freeport export venture would start commercial operations.
Meanwhile, Kitimat LNG in western Canada, originally proposed as a gas import venture, has recently also turned into an export project. The Apache-backed project would be supplied by shale gas from the Horn River region in British Columbia and is aiming to start exports to Asia in 2014, where it will compete directly with Australian LNG suppliers.
Macquarie's energy division, boosted by last year's acquisition of Constellation Energy's gas trading business, has developed into the fourth-largest marketer of natural gas in the US. It started trading LNG earlier this year and was involved in the re-export of one cargo of the fuel from Freeport.
The Australian group's move reflects a growing trend of financial institutions moving into physical LNG trading, with Barclays Capital, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch all already involved to varying extents.
Macquarie will contribute to initial development costs of the export plant, but the full capital cost of up to $US2 billion will be covered by construction finance underpinned by take-or-pay gas contracts, the Australian Financial Review understands.
The Freeport LNG export project will have the capacity to liquefy 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas a day. The partners plan to apply next month to the US Department of Energy for an export license and will also start seeking approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"One of Australia's most successful expatriate executives has urged greater use of natural gas at home rather than for export as part of a broader policy of reaping more value from energy reserves.
Dow Chemical chief executive Andrew Liveris also warned the federal government that going it alone on a carbon price would not be a successful strategy because the US government needed to provide more global leadership in this area first.
 He said Dow had considered establishing downstream manufacturing facilities in Australia to process gas into chemical products but had not been able to get secure long-term supplies at the right price.
Mr Liveris, a strong advocate of resuscitating the US economy by focusing on high-end manufacturing opportunities, said Australia was passing up a significant opportunity during the commodities boom to add value to its natural wealth at home.
 The big issue that Australia has missed is how to take the precious gas we have in this country and not just export it as liquefied natural gas that gets burnt in Japan and elsewhere but to value-add it here.
 One of the best uses of natural gas is to sequester it in a product that is in use going into a plastic or organic chemical so we can make the products that we use every day. That is a wonderful use of a natural resource.
 You [Australia] are never in the conversation. This is decided in Houston [Texas]. Australia never decides. The country does not have a strategy, it doesn't have a public policy strategy. You have decided to let it be decided in that way.
 A lot of other countries have an energy policy and part of it is to value-add the energy resources in the country. 
Mr Liveris was talking to The Australian Financial Review before delivering the centenary oration last night at the University of Queensland, where he originally studied chemical engineering.
After a 34-year career at Dow, where he was appointed chief executive in 2005, Mr Liveris is one of the most prominent Australian-born executives in the US and part of a small group that includes Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman, Kellogg chief executive David Mackay and News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch.
Mr Liveris recently became the only non-US citizen on President Barack Obama's new export advisory council, is the vice-chairman of the US Business Council and a member of US business groups dealing with both China and India.
While he cautioned the Australian government against setting a carbon price before the United States took more action to deal with climate change, Mr Liveris said business needed to prepare for tougher government standards to reduce carbon emissions.
He backed changes in building standards as a way to have a relatively quick impact on carbon emissions from new buildings followed by a flow-on to older buildings as the standards were extended more widely.
Despite the apparent anti-government mood in the US reflected in the recent congressional elections, Mr Liveris forecast a shift towards a more active effort by government and business in the country to develop new manufacturing based on high technology.
He said the US could not survive as a wealthy economy relying on traditional manufacturing expertise and both sides of politics saw the need to look for an advanced manufacturing plan.
He said business had a responsibility to be involved in public policy development and should not just  sit on the sidelines and say, 'I've got bad politicians or bad government'.
 I think the next generation of thinking as a country about competitive advantage is overdue.
 One thing we are advocating strongly in the US that the Obama administrative has been somewhat attentive to is what are the next high-tech sectors.
 We call it advanced manufacturing, so forget industry policy because that is yesterday's term. 
Dow Chemical has 150 manufacturing sites in 35 countries and produces 3300 products.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Environment and Water Minister Tony Burke was warned by his department of  significant concerns  that $35Â billion of coal-seam gas projects in Queensland could damage water supplies, cause land subsidence and interfere with reforms in the Murray-Darling basin.
Despite this, Mr Burke gave environmental approval last month for projects in the Surat and Bowen basins, led by Santos and the BG Group, and imposed more than 300 conditions, including strict water monitoring.
 Advice from the Water Group within Mr Burke's department said the companies had been  extremely conservative  in their estimates of how much water they would take from the Great Artesian Basin. The minister's department said it could be  at least 1000Â years  before water levels recovered.
It warned that gas extraction was  likely to have a significant impact  on native species dependent on natural springs and implications for the Murray-Darling basin by reducing water in the Condamine Alluvium.
The companies have estimated there may be 30Â centimetres of land subsidence, but the Water Group suggested it could be much more, noting that previous extraction in the region had caused land movements of up to several metres.
The advice was labelled  draft  and provided to Mr Burke in that form. It has been tabled in response to a Senate motion, along with hundreds of other files that informed his decision to approve the projects on OctoberÂ 22.
The decision was consistent with overall advice he received from the department in separate documents, which said environmental risks were  not unacceptable .
The Water Group raised concerns about changes to water chemistry in the Great Artesian Basin aquifers as a result of coal-seam gas extraction and about the volume of salts and heavy metals in the water produced in the process and how it would be disposed of.
The advice predated the news on OctoberÂ 19 that cancer-causing chemicals had been detected at Origin Energy coal-seam gas exploration wells in Queensland.
The wells work by extracting water from the coal seams, altering the pressure and freeing the gas to flow to the surface.
The proposal is for thousands of wells across the region to access gas that can be converted to liquefied natural gas for export.
Farmers fear drilling will contaminate or severely deplete water levels in the Great Artesian Basin, one of the world's largest sources of underground water and which supports agriculture in south-east Queensland.
They are rallying against expansion of the coal-seam gas industry in other regions, including the Liverpool Plains in northern NSW.
The Water Group said it was concerned by the  general level of uncertainty associated with these proposals, and the inability of proponents to accurately quantify their individual and collective impacts over the [30-year] life of their projects .
It noted the  possibility of impacts on highly productive agricultural land  and said that, under the Water Act 2007, there should be an independent study of how mining operations would affect water supplies and quality before mining licences were granted.
Santos, BG Group and Origin Energy's Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with ConocoPhillips said their proposed projects may extract just 1819Â gigalitres of water over 30Â years.
However, the Water Group's advice calculated their water use will be much higher â€“ in the order of 14,035 to 27,411Â gigalitres, and could even go as high as 45,000 gigalitres.
To put this in context, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has triggered a rural backlash by suggesting that 3000 to 4000 gigalitres of water in that river system be shifted from farming to the environment.
The Water Group said the planned coal-seam gas extraction would affect water management in the Condamine system, which is covered by the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan and is one of the most heavily used aquifers in the basin.
It said water from the Condamine would flow in to replace water taken from the coal seams and this would need to be accounted for.
On announcing his approval of the Santos and BG Group proposals, Mr Burke said there were significant economic benefits to the projects but his focus had been on environmental matters.
The Greens want a moratorium on expansion of the coal-seam gas industry until there is a better understanding of the impacts on underground water and farming.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"BTEX BRISBANE, Nov 24 AAP - Queensland's parliament has banned mining companies from using four toxic chemicals in the extraction of coal seam gas (CSG).
Companies are prohibited from using benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) in hydraulic fracturing or fraccing - a process where sand, water and chemicals are pumped at high pressure into a coal seam to fracture it and release gas.
 The Natural Resources and Other Legislation Amendment Bill was passed in parliament on Tuesday night.
Natural Resources Minister Stephen Robertson has said BTEX was not used in Queensland's CSG operations but the ban would ensure the dangerous chemicals would never be used.
The cancer-causing chemical benzene has been found in gas wells and water samples at two CSG operations.
Arrow Energy confirmed last week three of its 60 wells had traces of benzene and last month, benzene was also found in eight wells at Origin and Australia Pacific LNG's CSG wells.
Both companies say they do not use BTEX.
The BTEX chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene can be naturally occurring.
Farmers in the Surat and Bowen basins in southwest and central west Queensland are not convinced the industry is safe and have launched a campaign to lock their gates to keep the mining companies out.

The Australian Financial Review yesterday revealed advice from the water group in Mr Burke's department that parts of the Great Artesian Basin could take  at least 1000 years  to recover from the developments.
 The advice also said that, under the Water Act 2007, an independent study was required before licences could be granted for gas extraction from the Surat and Bowen Basins by Santos and BG Group.
Federal Nationals MP Bruce Scott, whose electorate of Maranoa covers the planned projects, said the Great Artesian Basin supplied water not only to farmers, but to country towns and for stock and domestic use through the region.
 There must be a peer-reviewed study by an independent body â€“ not a government department,  he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The QR National float was touted as a harbinger of 2011's market for initial public offerings. With that in mind, it's hardly surprising there was a full house at the institutional lunch for Ironbridge Capital's Easternwell Group this week.
At least a dozen fund managers are understood to have congregated on Monday for a preliminary sounding on a potential float in the second quarter of next year. The response was said to be positive, no doubt helped by the fact that Easternwell is being presented as a major beneficiary from the anticipated explosion in coal seam gas activity in Queensland.
 The thinking is that Easternwell will need to have secured at least a couple of meaningful contracts by the first quarter to convince our wily local fund managers of its merits.
But the fact that BG Group has reached final investment decision (FID) on its liquefied natural gas project and FID approval for Santos and Origin is expected before the end of the year obviously bodes well.
Easternwell is forecast to deliver about $70 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the year to June 2011.
The MAC Services Group, the mine-site accommodation business, was recently purchased by Oil States International, a North American company, for $650 million â€“ or a multiple of 10.3 times.
On this basis, it's hoped that Easternwell will command a price tag of about $700 million.
As previously reported in Street Talk, Macquarie Group has the mandate to advise on what is a dual-track exit process.
But if the float route is chosen, it is possible another investment bank will be brought on board.
Trade buyers that are likely to kick the tyres include Ensign Energy Services, Canada's second-largest land-based drilling contractor; Nabors (which already has a couple of drilling rigs in Australia); Saxon Energy Services (part-owned by private equity investor First Reserve); Precision Drilling; and behemoth Weatherford International, which already has a small presence Down Under.

John Mackenzie of Friends of the Earth said Tara was home to relatively poor people who had chosen a residential rural lifestyle when land in the area was cheap.
They now faced seeing their lifestyles ruined and their land rendered unsaleable by gas wells, Mr Mackenzie said.
 People have moved there because they didn't have much other choice of where they could go.
 They live quiet lives and they don't have a lot. They are a poor community,  Mr Mackenzie said.
 Now imagine when a gas company rolls in as they have done today with their seismic drilling equipment, with their tests, with a security escort, no consultation with the community, no information about what was happening. 
He said the Queensland government's new laws meant miners had unfettered access to land.
 They have one of two choices,  Mr Mackenzie said.
 They either take the paltry amount of money that's being offered to them by the mining companies and then have to live the rest of their lives in a gas field, surrounded by compressor stations, gas wells, pipelines, evaporation ponds and flaring stations, or they can fight.
 That's what they have chosen to do. 
Mr Mackenzie said QGC, the Australian subsidiary of multinational natural gas producer BG Group, had made a mistake.
 They have pushed a community against a wall, and they will see that that community, with nothing to lose, will not back down.
 They have no other choice. 
Organiser of the Lock the Gate campaign, Drew Hutton, said Queensland's coordinator-general had pointed out problems specific to the Tara community of around 300 people.
 The small size of rural residential allotments - many are 12 hectares in area - and higher population density, particularly in the Tara-Chinchilla locality, increases the risk for gas field activities to cause environmental harm and nuisance,  the coordinator-general's report said.
 In particular, noise and vibration, dust and light could affect more residents and these effects could have more severe impacts on residents who through physical and financial circumstances are more sedentary. 
Mr Hutton said the Tara community had nowhere else to go.
 They can either resist non-violently or see QGC move onto their properties rendering them unsaleable and forcing them to live cheek-by-jowl with coal seam gas infrastructure the rest of their lives.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A community rally will be held in Newcastle this morning to protest against the approval of a controversial plan to explore for natural gas off the coast.
Residents and environmentalists are angry that the State Government has given Advent Energy the green light to drill an exploratory well 55-kilometres east of Newcastle.
 The company now needs the final tick from the Federal Environment Department before drilling can start early next month.
Lake Macquarie Greens Councillor, Phillipa Parsons says there has been a severe lack of community consultation.
 There are mandatory requirements for the proponent to consult and that is through the community consultative committee,  she said.
 But that has been less than transparent and less than adequate.
 Even those committee members, who are there by invitation only, still have not been provided with a copy of the environment plan or the oil spill contingency plan.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Queensland Parliament has passed water legislation that covers issues including household water bills, the coal seam gas (CSG) industry and Wild Rivers laws.
The legislation expands the role of the Energy Ombudsman to investigate water disputes.
 Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy, Stephen Robertson, says there will also be water bill templates that break down state and council water charges.
 For the first time we will know who is responsible for what,  he told the House.
But Opposition spokesman Tim Nicholls says allowing the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) to regulate water price hikes will not ease the pain for consumers.
 The continuing issue for south-east Queenslanders will be the rising cost of basic household needs like water and electricity,  he said.
The legislation increases groundwater reporting requirements for coal seam gas companies and paves the way for expanding Wild Rivers laws to the Lake Eyre Basin.
Public service report
Premier Anna Bligh also tabled a report in Parliament about the state of the public service.
More than 40,000 public servants were surveyed for the study.
Ms Bligh told Parliament it shows 81 per cent of workers enjoy their job, but it also highlights some challenges.
 These include the need for our agencies to better manage major organisational change, the need to improve the management of employee underperformance, and the need to build the capability of senior leaders,  she said.
Neighbourhood disputes
The State Government also introduced legislation aimed at minimising neighbourhood disputes.
Attorney-General Cameron Dick says the bill clarifies who is responsible for maintaining trees and dividing fences.
He told Parliament it modernises the current laws.
 Prior to its commencement, the Government will introduce a strategy to ensure that Queenslanders are aware of the important changes brought about by this bill,  he said.
 Friendly, tight-knit communities are one of Queensland's great strengths.
 This bill will help preserve the great lifestyle that Queenslanders have come to enjoy and it will make it easier for neighbours to avoid and reduce disputes before they escalate. 
Christmas cheer
Queensland MPs also exchanged pleasantries last night as State Parliament wrapped up for the year.
Ms Bligh used her end-of-year speech to reflect on the triumphs and tragedies of 2010.
 The sight of a teenage girl from the Sunshine Coast bringing her boat through Sydney Heads [ and] heartbreak in the form of a one-in-100 year flood which devastated the central-west of our state,  she said.
She concluded by wishing all MPs well.
 I do actually look forward to seeing all of you in 2011,  she said.
Opposition Leader John-Paul Langbroek is also looking to the future.
 There are brighter days ahead for Queensland - fresh ideas, fresh goals, fresh standards and a fresh start for Queensland,  he said.
More politicians needed
Parliamentary Speaker John Mickel used his end of year speech to flag the need for more politicians.
Mr Mickel says Parliament needs extra members and buildings to keep pace with population growth.
 When this Parliament began 150 years ago there were 26 members - state's population was a little over 28,000 - a population per member of a little over 1,000,  he said.
 One-hundred-and-fifty years later and the population has grown to more than 4.5 million.
 With 89 members, that works out to be a population per member figure of more than 50,000. 
Parliament is due to sit again in mid-February.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"BEACH Energy has joined Japanese trading group Itochu to investigate the potential for uncommitted gas resources in South Australia to underpin a mini-liquefied natural gas export project.
Planning for the potential $1 billion investment in a plant producing 1 million tonnes of LNG a year has advanced to site selection. Beach holds 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas in SA's Cooper Basin and Victoria.
 But it is a feature of the plan that its long-term gas requirements could come from so-called unconventional or shale gas resources.
Beach has an exploration program under way to confirm the Cooper Basin's shale gas potential. It has estimated that in the Nappamerri Trough region, the potential gas in place could be more than 200 trillion cubic feet.
The liberation of gas from shale rock formations using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques has revolutionised the gas market in the US.
The abundance of shale gas reserves has driven US gas prices down sharply and fuelled interest in the US becoming an LNG exporter.
The plant size proposed for SA is small compared with standard plant size in Western Australia, where new  processing trains  based on conventional gas supplies are generally 4 million tonnes a year.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"GREAT uncertainty remains about the potentially damaging impacts of multiple coal seam gas projects in Queensland's rich gas fields, the Federal Government has been warned.
Experts cautioned Environment Minister Tony Burke about the concerns before he gave the green light to proceed with two massive liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland last month.
 In a Geoscience Australia report, the experts shot down environmental modelling provided by the companies involved, saying there were ``a number of shortfalls'' in the approach they had taken.
The report found some of the modelling was inadequate and ``not suitable for understanding the likely impacts of widespread CSG development across the Surat and Bowen basins''.
It was one of hundreds of documents quietly given to the Senate after a Greens' motion calling for the release of all information informing the Government's decision to approve the two projects.
Greens Leader Bob Brown said the report was ``damning'' of that decision and said environmental impacts from the developments could take centuries to reverse.
``I think it's a failure of responsibility at a state and federal government level to use the precautionary principle and make sure that the aquifers and ground water is protected,'' he said.
The report, dated September 17 this year, raised fears about the potential impact on local aquifers, connected surface water systems and spring communities in the Great Artesian Basin. It said ``high inherent uncertainties'' would prevail until sufficient production data was available and called for the State Government and the Commonwealth to take the lead on regional monitoring.
In approving the projects, Mr Burke took up the recommendation and said the companies would have to co-operate with their competitors for a Queensland Water Commission-led regional impact study.
The reams of documents also revealed Mr Burke was at odds with one of his fellow cabinet ministers over some of the 300 conditions slapped on the projects.
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson wrote to his colleague to cast doubt on the ``practicality, environmental impact or safety'' of re-injecting water into aquifers affected during CSG extraction.
He said there was no guarantee it was suitable and the Government risked rushing a solution mired in uncertainty.
Mr Burke replied to advise he had softened the requirement to allow the companies to use other methods to maintain aquifer water pressure.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips could be looking to China for the customer they badly need to support their $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project in Queensland.
Specifically, Chinese energy giant Sinopec has been suggested as the most likely buyer for the pair's LNG. Sinopec's name is only a whisper so far but it stands out amid the deafening silence that has surrounded Origin and Conoco's LNG marketing efforts to date.
 It's only a month before Origin and ConocoPhillips are supposed to be approving APLNG for development (although Origin has already added the caveat of customer agreements to its timetable) and as yet the pair is yet to secure buyers for a single cargo.
A deal with Sinopec would complete the Chinese triumvirate in coal seam gas. CNOOC is already a customer for BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG, while PetroChina is a 50 per cent partner in Royal Dutch Shell's Queensland play.
Other arguably stronger LNG propositions than APLNG are available for any buyers looking for LNG volumes, such as the Wheatstone, Pluto-2 or Prelude projects, but APLNG has one thing firmly in its favour. China is full of coal and therefore full of coal seam gas, and the country's energy majors would love to get a taste of the industry here with a view to applying the techniques back in China.
While Origin and Conoco would love to get a big Chinese buyer over the line, one suggestion is that China's National Development and Reform Commission â€“ which signs off on foreign investments â€“ is applying very frugal LNG pricing guidelines before it will give its blessing to any investment. That means those looking to deal with China may have to be willing to take a haircut on the LNG price they will receive.
While the sales contract uncertainty continues to hover over APLNG, Shell's own coal seam gas project continues to have its own question marks. There's not enough gas within the venture to support an LNG development of Shell-like proportions, meaning the idea of a union with APLNG or Santos's Gladstone LNG could gain some legs.
While Shell's decision to sell 10 per cent of Woodside is widely seen as the company freeing up some cash to support its coming big capex spends in Australia, more conspiratorial minds are wondering if the sell-down is the precursor to a move on APLNG or GLNG.
One can imagine the reception Shell would have received from the Foreign Investment Review Board if it had been moving on, say, Santos or Origin while also holding 34 per cent of Woodside. With a 10 per cent stake sold and its intentions to quit Woodside signalled, any acquisition may receive a friendlier reception.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"Companies are chasing workers again as confidence returns
RESOURCE hot spots such as coal seam gas and underground coal gasification are facing a massive shortage of workerswith the skills and technical expertise to enter these emerging fields.
 With deals such as the multi billion-dollar agreement for BG Group to supply liquefied natural gas to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation from its Curtis Island project at Gladstone in Queensland, the demand for talent is likely to be high.
To overcome the skills shortage resources companies are targeting workers from related industries such as the coal sector, says Richard Dunks, managing director of specialist executive search and human resources consulting firm Vantage Human Capital. In turn, this is leading to employment turnover in traditional resources companies.
``Those people need to come from somewhere and they're usually [drawn] from parallel areas, so it is creating a little bit more of a churn,'' he says.
Dunks believes confidence is returning to the resources sector in the wake of the global financial crisis, despite uncertainty as a result of, first, the Labor Government's resources super profits tax and, second, the delayed federal election result.
``I think there was certainly a hiatus with the resources super tax whereas now there's a bit more clarity around what's going on, so people are a lot more confident making those high-end decisions.''
Not surprisingly, the resources powerhouses of Western Australia and Queensland are dominating jobs growth, with burgeoning sectors such as coal seam gas and underground coal gasification creating many new roles. Dunk says it is not easy to find workers with direct experience in such specialist areas.
``I think employers are going to have to not necessarily relax their standards but be more flexible and open-minded and creative about where these individuals are going to come from.''
As confidence returns to the job market, he confirms that skilled workers are again starting to assess their options after sitting tight for the past 18 months or so.
``These are people who are usually passive because they're happy and comfortable in their role, but they know that they've hit a ceiling or they're looking for that next challenge, a parallel industry or a competitor.''
While job vacancies are on the rise, Dunks says the situation has not yet returned to the heights of 2007 when companies were holding Dutch auctions and making huge offers and counter-offers to woo candidates. Some employees were also chancing their arm and seeking pay hikes in the order of 20 per cent.
``I think everybody is hoping and praying that it doesn't [happen again] because, oddly enough, the individual might win in terms of playing off a bit of a Dutch auction, but really it's unsettling for everyone and the reality is that if people move purely for the dollar they're moving for the wrong reasons.''
In terms of what companies can do to win over workers, Dunks believes it requires a combination of factors including pay, job challenges and work-life balance.
While Vantage Human Capital is mainly engaged in recruiting talent for white-collar roles such as commercial managers, chief financial officers, financial controllers, project accountants and human resources professionals, he says there is also demand for blue-collar workers.
Specialist jobs in areas involving complex land access issues are also growing. In August, the Queensland Parliament passed the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010, introducing a new framework for land access and compensation arrangements that will apply across all tenure types in the state.
The legislation has the potential to affect projects such as drilling on farm land or indigenous land tracts.
Dunk says the laws will create employment opportunities involving the environment and sustainability, tenement management, community and stakeholder liaison, cultural heritage and native title management.
``It's such a sensitive issue. You need to make sure everyone is working off the same hymn sheet, that everyone's in agreement about what you can do and what you can't do on the land in terms of general relationship management,'' he says.
Such issues came to light recently when Cougar Energy was forced to shut down its pilot underground coal gasification plant near Kingaroy, 220km north-west of Brisbane, after the state government learned that traces of chemicals benzene and toluene had been found in groundwater at the site and on a neighbouring property.
``When PR gets out that's negative in those communities it spreads like wildfire and it makes it difficult,'' Dunks says. ``So it's a unique area, but putting that to one side it's creating new opportunities and I guess new jobs and new careers out there.''
He is confident ongoing demand for resources from China and other powerhouses such as India means projects and jobs will continue to flourish.
``There are a lot of factors, but the reality is that it's a pretty unique time and a unique opportunity within resources [with] the emerging new industries that I think will prove, in time, with technology and patience and careful management that they will be a good, long-term sustainable industry for the country.''

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"Protesters tell of community concerns
EXPLORATORY drilling off Newcastle could discover enough natural gas to convert all the Hunter's coal-fired power stations to gas, Advent Energy executive director David Breeze said.
 Mr Breeze said such a discovery could allow all new baseload power stations in NSW to be gas-fired.
Preliminary studies estimate gas reserves worth $50 billion in the company's offshore petroleum licence area from Newcastle to Wollongong.
Advent Energy, through its subsidiary company Asset Energy, plans to begin drilling in the first half of December.
 This project has the capacity to reduce Australia's carbon emissions by around 16 per cent, which would be a massive reduction,  Mr Breeze said.
About 100 people attended a rally outside Newcastle Town Hall yesterday about the NSW government's decision to approve the company's exploratory gas drilling plan 55 kilometres off Newcastle.
The rally coincided with a community consultative meeting the government set up to consider the project.
Rally organiser and Hands Off Our Coast spokeswoman Phillipa Parsons said she approached Mr Breeze and a government official to address the protesters.
 They both refused,  Ms Parsons said.
 Community concern about this is huge among people that know about it, but a lot of people don't know about it. 
Mr Breeze said he was unable to meet protesters because he had to attend a meeting inside the town hall.
The two sides have tussled over the suitability of gas as an energy source. Ms Parsons said  gas is not a clean, renewable energy source .
Mr Breeze said  renewables could only contribute 20 per cent of total power consumption  and gas was much cleaner than coal.
 We need gas to meet increased energy demand,  he said.
Environmentalists are concerned about the potential for an oil spill and damage to the coast and marine life.

SUNMAI,Sunday Mail,2010,4,"A MASSIVE $56 million worth of natural gas - enough to supply nearly 90,000 homes for a year - is leaking from broken pipes across South Australia and creating a risk to the public, the state's industry regulator has warned.
The growing amount of leaking gas, up 42 per cent in volume in the past six years, has the Essential Services Commission of SA at odds with the state's major gas supplier over the extent of the risk and the pace of repairs to aged pipes.
 ESCOSA has ordered the monopoly gas supplier Envestra to halve the gas leaks by 2016, which would improve supply efficiency and significantly reduce the risk of ``fire and explosion''.

Gas leaks prompt blast fear
From Page 1
In its annual report released this week, ESCOSA says the rising volume of leaks was its ``primary'' concern and ``creates a greater risk of fire and explosion''. The ``potential public safety concerns'' needed to be addressed, the report said.
ESCOSA chief executive Rajat Sarawat stood by these concerns when he spoke with the Sunday Mail, saying the watchdog wanted to avoid any chance of a gas explosion such as the fatal blast in the US in September which killed six people and injured up to 40 more in the same suburb.
``There was a case where a high pressure gas main was leaking and it lead to an explosion and fires in San Francisco in the US,'' Mr Sarawat said.
``We definitely want to avoid anything like that.''
Envestra, however, has downplayed the risks associated with leaking gas: ``We are talking about pipes running down the street and the leaks would disappear into the air . . . it's alarmist for ESCOSA to say there is a risk of fire or explosion,'' Envestra company secretary Des Petherick said.
He said gas typically leaked from corroded and broken metal pipes found in suburbs more than 30 years old.
The report shows that while Envestra had an agreement with ESCOSA to replace 100km of old cast iron and exposed steel pipes each year, the company has taken two financial years to replace 152km, at a cost of about $40 million.
Envestra blames the global financial crisis for its failure to meet maintenance targets.
Mr Petherick said the company had applied for $250 million from the Australian Energy Regulator to replace pipes.
``That money will come from gas customers over a period of time,'' Mr Petherick said. ``We are confident the (national) regulator will approve something around that mark but we will only replace what the regulator approves funding for.''
Energy Minister Pat Conlon said he had supported Envestra's funding bid.
``I have written to the independent national regulator - the AER - asking to consider sufficient funding for Envestra to reduce this amount of leakage,'' he said. ``Any funding increase would have to be approved by the independent regulator and would be paid through the network component of customers' energy bills.''
ESCOSA's annual report said there were 2902 complaints of gas leaks made by the public in 2009/10 - up 10 per cent on the previous financial year.
The Metropolitan Fire Service has advised the public to call 000 if they suspect there is a gas leak and if it is near a property to evacuate the site.
``You should also eliminate any ignition sources,'' MFS acting commissioner of metropolitan operations Michael Morgan said.
Editorial, Page 50
FYI SA stats
- 8 PER CENT of all gas entering the supply network is lost to leakage.
- CUSTOMERS contribute $7 million to the cost of gas lost from the network.

SUNMAI,Sunday Mail,2010,4,"Think gas when replacing your hot-water unit
Go cleaner and more cost-efficient with continuous-flow, natural gas hot water in your home. ``Natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel so the environmental benefits are impressive,'' says Andrew Staniford, Envestra's group manager commercial.
 ``A natural gas, continuous-flow hot-water unit can even produce fewer carbon emissions than an electric-boosted, solar hot-water system.''
It only heats the water you need so it's energy and cost-efficient and the hot water never runs out. For safety, the system also comes with a temperature-control feature.
``Not only does natural gas hot water offer a huge range of benefits - functional, environmental and cost efficiency - the installation and set-up cost is the lowest out of all hot-water options, specially if you already have natural gas connected,'' says Andrew.
With innovations such as temperature-controlled natural gas hot water, the introduction of solar hot water and new government regulations phasing out old electric-storage hot water, there might be more to think about than you realised when it comes to replacing a hot-water unit.
Andrew says solar hot water has gained in popularity in recent years thanks to big rebates and a conscious push for more renewable energy. ``However, the sun isn't always shining and most solar hot-water systems are electric-boosted,'' he says. ``This means during the winter months or if, like the majority of people, you use hot water mainly at night or first thing in the morning, the system could be running largely on electricity.''
He says that even with rebates, solar hot water is still among the most expensive and complicated to install. Electric hot-water systems cannot be installed in new and existing homes in South Australia as part of a federal phase-out program.
Instead, electric storage water heaters must be replaced with an electric heat pump, natural gas or solar hot-water system. Andrew says heat pumps can potentially lessen the environmental impact but noise and cold temperatures can be an issue and counteractive.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"CSG BRISBANE, Nov 29 AAP - A $350 million water treatment plant will be built on the Darling Downs to treat salty water brought to the surface as part of coal seam gas mining.
Multinational QGC (Queensland Gas Company) says the water treatment plant will have eventual production capacity of up to 100 megalitres a day and it will be treated and pumped from near the Kenya gas processing plant 20km to Chinchilla Weir for use in irrigation.
 The company says it is  new  water but farmers say it's extremely old water stored in the Great Artesian Basin and the impacts of its extraction are unknown.
 The water treatment facilities will benefit farmers, town residents and industry around Chinchilla,  QGC said in a statement.
 The facilities will treat water from the Walloon coal seams not usually used by local communities and will be a new water source that can be used as a substitute for water from the shallower, distressed aquifers currently used for agriculture. 
QGC Managing Director Catherine Tanna said the water is salty and would otherwise not be used.
 Our investment will make it possible to put this water to good use by treating it through leading-edge technology for use in agriculture and industry and it may supplement existing town supplies,  she said.
A QGC spokesman said the company is in discussions to find a use for 200 tonnes of salt per day.
 The aim is we find some sort of commercial grade use for it,  he said.
However,  as a very last resort , the salt will be buried in government-approved and strictly controlled dumps if a commercial outlet cannot be found, he said.
AgForce policy director Drew Wagner said the water was coming from the Walloon coal measures underground aquifer, part of the Great Artesian Basin.
 If you start de-watering various aquifers in that basin, we don't know what that inter-aquifer relationship's going to be,  Mr Wagner said.
He said depressurising one aquifer will impact others but to what extent is uncertain.
He said the water supply touted by QGC will last only a few years and the problems of the waste stream, including large quantities of salt, were not resolved.
 They keep banging on about the virtues of this `new' water to be utilised by landholders for food production, but the reality is that water will only be available for a short period of time and you can't guarantee the volume,  Mr Wagner said.
Mr Wagner repeated AgForce's calls for a moratorium on the CSG industry.
 This isn't about us against them, it's not about the agricultural sector trying to remove them from the landscape, it's about balance and sustainability,  he said.
 We've called for a moratorium so all of us can take a deep breath, all of us stand back and use the scientific information we have to determine what that balance is.
 What if we've already gone past it?

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Cobar is unlikely to have access to natural gas in the near future with the Shire Council abandoning further investigations into the proposal.
The Council has carried out several studies during the past 15 years into the feasibility of installing a pipeline to the town and establishing a gas fired power station in Cobar.
 A study in 2002 found it would cost almost $100-million, but the Council has been unable to get any funding from the State and Federal Governments or nearby mining companies.
The Mayor, Lillian Brady, said while the extra jobs and development would have been good for the town, there are still plenty of opportunities for growth.
 We've got, possibly got another three mines starting up in Cobar, so Cobar Shire will help them where we can,  she said.
 So, I think our resources in Cobar are terrific. 
The Council says it would take significant investment from local mines and the State and Federal Governments, before it will reconsider connecting the community to natural gas.
The current pipeline runs 70 kilometres south of the town and significant infrastructure would be needed for the connection.
Councillor Brady said even if the Council could afford to install the pipeline and build the gas station, it would lose money.
 It was too expensive and I don't think the usage would have been there,  she said.
 For the output of the money, the usage wouldn't have been there for the...because the mines weren't interested.

The $350 million facility will treat water produced at QGC's Chinchilla gas processing plant and pump it to the town's weir for agricultural, industrial and potentially domestic use.
 Company spokesman Mark Todd says when fully operational it will produce 100 megalitres a day.
 This gives us an opportunity to use that resource and put it to good use,  he said.
He says the company is still devising a plan to dispose of the 200 tonnes of salt a day the plant will generate but says dumping it will be a last resort.
The treatment facility is expected to open in October next year.

AgForce grains president Wayne Newton says the company's plans will put more pressure on local water acquifiers.
Mr Newton says the company is creating the illusion it is creating a new water resource for farmers.
 It is water that's coming from the Walloon coal measures, which are in fact part of the Great Artesian Basin,  he said.
 Because this basin is already over-allocated, it is extremely disappointing to us and landholders across the region to see this huge, big, new drawdown from this resource.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The imminent announcement of another cost blowout and schedule delay at Woodside Petroleum's $13 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia could be a sign of the future for Australia's LNG construction boom.
Analysts have warned that increasing LNG project construction in Australia means cost blowouts such as that to be announced by Woodside in the next 24 hours will become more common.
 Woodside is expected to announce the results of its latest Pluto review tomorrow, or possibly today, and analysts expect costs to increase by between $200 million and $700 million. The schedule for first production is likely to be extended from March 2011 to mid-2011.
While Pluto has been the only LNG plant under construction for much of the past three years, the Chevron-led Gorgon LNG project in WA, the ExxonMobil-operated Papua New Guinea LNG development and, most recently, BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG plant have all started construction.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said that with competition for equipment and labour intensifying, cost pressures were set to become an increasingly common theme.
 This was one project being built at a time when there really weren't any other LNG projects under construction,  Mr Ramsay said.
 If Woodside has run into these kinds of issues and they were the only ones building this kind of project until very recently, what kind of signal does that provide to some of these other projects? 
More than a dozen LNG projects, representing $200 billion-plus in investment, are at various stages of planning. Santos's Gladstone LNG project is set to become the next to move into construction; its $16 billion development is due to be approved next month.
Woodside announced a cost blowout at Pluto in November last year, flagging a 6 per cent to 10 per cent increase on its original budget. Since then, the development has been struck by bouts of industrial action.
The company also had to rebuild the project's gas flare towers after they were found to not comply with cyclone resistance specifications.
Mr Ramsay said the complicated nature of LNG developments meant cost pressures would be likely.
 Every project is going to have problems associated with it. Woodside is not immune, and nobody else is,  he said.
 It's going to be very rare to see any of these projects deliver on time and on budget, and it's going to be very hard for all of them â€“ especially when you get more than one being built at once. 
Citigroup analyst Mark Greenwood added $360 million to his Pluto budget forecast last week, having added $400 million in August.
He noted that Woodside could suffer further, due to its contractual obligations to begin supplying Pluto LNG from early next year. That would involve buying LNG cargoes at spot prices and selling them at its lower contracted prices.
Woodside reported some good news last week with a successful discovery at its 100 per cent-owned Remy well. Remy is a potential source for a second LNG train at Pluto, which would greatly enhance the project's economics.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"WOODSIDE By Nicole Stevens
SYDNEY, Nov 30 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd doesn't believe there are any obstacles for a positive final investment decision on its controversial Browse liquefied natural gas (LNG) development in Western Australia.
 Chief executive Don Voelte says the decision to build the LNG processing plant onshore at James Price Point was made unanimously by all joint venture partners.
This includes BHP Billiton Ltd, which has an 8.33 per cent share in the project.
 We love Browse and we love where it is going and we hear things said about it that are basically not true,  Mr Voelte told shareholders at the oil and gas producer's annual investor briefing on Tuesday.
Mr Voelte said Woodside, the major force behind the Browse project,  does not see any obstacles that we can't overcome at this time .
 As the operator, as the one talking to government, as the one talking to the traditional owners of the land, as one who is talking to the Greens and the NGO's (non government organisations), we know exactly where we stand and we see no roadblocks,  he said.
While Woodside wants the plant built onshore in the Kimberley region, possible alternatives include piping the gas to the existing North West Shelf processing facilities at Karratha, several hundred kilometres from the Browse fields, which are offshore about 425km north of Broome.
Another alternative was to process the gas on floating vessels offshore.
 Something was said at an AGM (annual general meeting) that we are still in concept select. That is absolutely wrong,  Mr Voelte said.
 All of the joint venture participants unanimously selected the development concept, which is building the browse LNG plant onshore at the West Australia LNG precinct. 
Mr Voelte was responding to comments by BHP Billiton chairman Jac Nasser at the mining giant's annual general meeting in Perth a fortnight ago that it  won't proceed with any development where our values and standards are compromised in any way .
The comments were echoed by BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers and have been widely interpreted as reluctance to proceed.
 There are several other comments that have been made, that I would say we agree with,  Mr Voelte said on Tuesday.
 We will not build something that does not meet our value system, and at this point we see absolutely nothing in the road that will stop us from building at the James Price Point state LNG precinct. 
Mr Voelte reiterated that the project remained on track to enter the front-end engineering design phase in early 2011.
 Frankly we see, again, nothing stopping us from fulfilling the commitment to get to a (final investment) decision, and we think a positive decision, by June 2012. 
Mr Voelte said Woodside was already seeing strong demand for its share of the Browse Basin gas.
 We have more people interested in our portion of the gas than we have gas to sell,  he said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"WOODSIDE By Nicole Stevens
SYDNEY, Nov 30 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd says costs for its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project have blown out by $900 million and it will take another six months to begin production while it rebuilds equipment that falls short of design specifications.
 The oil and gas producer says the Pluto project, offshore from Karratha in Western Australia, will cost $14 billion, up 6.9 per cent from its prior estimate of $13.1 billion.
Woodside is rebuilding several flare towers used to burn off waste gas because it says they don't meet design requirements to withstand expected wind speeds.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte said he was disappointed with the cost overrun and delays.
 From our point of view, yes we are disappointed with this,  Mr Voelte told investors on a conference call on Tuesday.
 We wish we didn't have the problem, but for safety sake and other reasons we had to get it fixed. 
Despite the setback, Mr Voelte said he was  still very pleased  with the Pluto project's accelerated development.
Mr Voelte said that from discovery (in 2005) to production would have been 76 months even with Pluto's revised August 2011 start-up date, which was  unheard of in the LNG industry .
 It is a good platform and will serve Woodside investors for decades to come,  he said.
The first LNG cargo will be exported one month after the start-up date next year, which had been put back from February.
Woodside's share of production from Pluto is expected to be beween five million and nine million barrels of oil equivalent in 2011.
Woodside said it was continuing its search for gas to support Pluto's expansion to a second production train and beyond.
Mr Voelte sought to reassure investors that exploration activity in the inner and central hubs of Pluto was coming along as expected.
 We expect to find the volumes we require and we're well along that way. 
Woodside has drilled nine wells in the central hub region in search of its second expansion train.
Mr Voelte said he expected to build another train from nearby exploration opportunities, the inner and central hubs.
Woodside would  either find an additional train or two, or backfill the first two trains at Pluto from our future discoveries in the Claudius area and potentially the Cazadores hubs,  Mr Voelte said.
At 1420 AEDT, shares in Woodside were up 16 cents at $41.86 after an intraday high at $42.12.
Mr Voelte said Woodside was happy to have its independence after major shareholder Shell offloaded 10 per cent of its Woodside stakes on to the market earlier this month.
 We are happy where we will end up with this, which is an independent company with Shell off our register,  he said.
 It is what we kind of wanted over time.
Responding to a question, Mr Voelte said there would have been a better way for Shell to exit the business.
 At the end of the day what happened happened and we are looking forward now to the future. 
Woodside confirmed it expected its total production to be in the middle of 70-75 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) in 2010.
The company is targeting underlying production, excluding the Pluto project, of between 63 MMboe and 66 MMboe in 2011.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"POLLVIC By Melissa Jenkins
MELBOURNE, Nov 30 AAP - Country Victorians have been promised better roads, lower council rates and connections to natural gas, under the Baillieu-Ryan coalition government.
 Premier-elect Ted Baillieu and his deputy, Nationals leader Peter Ryan, have promised rural and regional Victorians their fair share of resources under the new government.
Farmers are thrilled the north-south pipeline will be switched off and cattle grazing will resume in the high country after the Bracks government banned the tradition in 2005.
The Nationals went to the election with the slogan: For Regional Victoria and now has its strongest representation in the Victorian parliament since 1985.
 We'll be watching to make sure they fulfill that campaign slogan,  Victorian Farmers' Federation president Andrew Broad told AAP.
Mr Ryan said the new government will be the  champions  of the bush and its focus will be beyond the streets of Melbourne.
 For those of us that live beyond its boundaries we are intent as a party ... in ensuring that the regional parts of the state do receive their fair share of what is available through government resources,  he told a packed media conference on Tuesday.
 We are the local champions for the regions and we do intend that in the course of our governance to grow our communities in a way that will contribute to all Victoria. 
The coalition went to the election promising a $1 billion Regional Growth Fund to be spent over two terms.
Mr Ryan said $100 million from the fund will be directed to local governments to support projects like upgrading libraries and sporting facilities.
Some 40 rural councils would also be able to apply for grants of up to $1 million a year to build roads and bridges, which Mr Ryan said would put downward pressure on local government rates.
Unlike during the Kennett years when the Liberal Party had a majority in both houses, with 35 seats in the lower house Mr Baillieu needs his coalition partners to form government.
The Nationals have boosted their lower house numbers from nine to 10 thanks to a massive 20 per cent swing away from Gippsland East independent Craig Ingram to Tim Bull.
 You could legitimately say what some of the pundits might have said was a political force that was gone is now back with a vengeance,  Mr Broad said.
Mr Broad said infrastructure and services outside the major regional centres of Geelong, Bendigo and Ballarat - which remain mostly ALP territory - had been neglected by Labor.
Municipal Association of Victoria president Bill McArthur welcomed the funding for infrastructure in rural towns.
 The smaller rural councils have got long roads, decaying infrastructure and small populations so the call on their resources has been very significant,  he said.
Mr McArthur said the coalition's $6 million promise to provide operational grants of up to $20,000 to rural kindergartens would have a strong impact.
Mr Baillieu said he was excited to deliver on the coalition's promise to invest $100 million over the next four years to connect towns, including Avoca, Winchelsea and Bannockburn, to natural gas.
Mr Broad said he was pleased cattle grazing would return in the high country.
 The high country is in a worse state after six or seven years of no grazing than it was after 100 years of grazing.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2010,4,"Recycled water from coal seam gas (CSG) mining will be pumped into the Chinchilla Weir via a new water treatment plant and pipeline costing more than $350 million.
QGC Pty Ltd, a BG Group business, has awarded contracts for the water treatment plant and associated facilities as a result of the its commitment to export liquefied natural gas from Gladstone.
 The gas will be pumped from gas fields across the Western Downs region.
A consortium of GE Betz and Laing O'Rourke Construction has landed the building contract with SunWater Limited appointed to build and operate a pipeline to transport treated water from the plant to the Chinchilla Weir.
According to QGC the plant will treat unused water from the Walloon coal seams, and will be a new water source that can be used as a substitute for water from the shallower, distressed aquifers currently used for agriculture.
GCTG Managing Director Catherine Tanna said water would be produced as a by- product of extracting natural gas from coal seams.
â€œThis is water that is salty and would otherwise not be used,â€? Ms Tanna said.
â€œOur investment will make it possible to put this water to good use by treating it through leading-edge technology for use in agriculture and industry and it may supplement existing town supplies.â€?
Member for Condamine Ray Hopper warns that the water they are extracting is not new water, and he is concerned about the large quantities of salt.
â€œThere is still not enough science about the effects of long term extraction of the vast quantities of water,â€? Mr Hopper said.
Laing O'Rourke will build the plant and GE will provide technical expertise and process equipment.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"QUEENSLAND farmers claim a proposal by coal-seam gas mine companies to build a water purification plant in the coal fields of the Darling Downs will not help their major problem of losing artesian water.
CSG miner Queensland Gas said yesterday it would spend $350 million building a water treatment plant near Chinchilla, 300km west of Brisbane, to purify water extracted from the ground during CSG operations.
 CSG is removed from the ground by extracting water, with gas automatically following, and farmers have complained the water taken out of the ground has too many impurities to be used to irrigate their crops.
Under the Queensland Gas proposal, a 33-megawatt gas-fired power station would put this water through a reverse-osmosis process and then transport up to 100 megalitres a day to Chinchilla Weir.
Queensland Gas managing director Catherine Tanna said the company's plant would provide a new water source that could be used as a substitute for water from the shallower distressed aquifers that are currently being used for agriculture.
``This is water that is salty and would otherwise not be used,'' Ms Tanna said.
The gas to run the reverse-osmosis plant would come from Queensland Gas' Condamine plant, and a spokesman said it would make up less than 1 per cent of the company's total energy requirements.
But farmers' group AgForce, which has been demanding a moratorium on the CSG industry until more information is available, said the proposal would not solve the problem of the artesian bore water being run down. AgForce policy director Drew Wagner said neither the CSG companies nor the government could explain what effect the industry would have on artesian water supplies.
``They just don't know what's going to happen,'' Mr Wagner said yesterday.
``In taking pressure off one aquifer, they could very well be putting pressure on another.''
To date only Queensland Gas has announced it will definitely be proceeding with its CSG project, which involves extracting gas from around the Chinchilla area and piping it to Gladstone, where it will be liquefied and then exported.
Oil and gas company Santos has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will go ahead with a similar $15 billion project, while another group based around Origin Energy is expected to make a final investment decision in the first half of next year.
Both Santos and Queensland Gas have received all relevant state and federal government approvals, while the Origin Energy project is still waiting on federal approvals.
The fledging industry is facing strong opposition from farmers and conservation groups, who have started a ``lock your gates'' campaign in a bid to deny CSG companies entrance to their properties so they can stop them searching for gas.
However, a Queensland Gas spokesman said the campaign seemed to have had little effect, as the company had leases over tenements owned by about 2000 landowners and was now dealing with about 1000 of them.
The company had secured 360 final agreements to proceed, the spokesman said.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"IN ONE hour, enough solar energy is absorbed by the earth to meet the whole world's energy needs for an entire year. Or put another way, if we could harness all the solar energy that reached the surface of the earth for one year, we could double all the energy that will ever be obtained from all non-renewable resources of oil, coal, natural gas and mined uranium combined. These numbers alone mean that solar needs to be at least one of the many options we use to meet our ongoing energy needs. Today, small scale solar power systems (without government subsidies) are still expensive although the costs are now only a fraction of those a few short years ago. But luckily there has been enough foresight by federal, state and territory governments to realise that a local solar industry is a critical building block for reducing our reliance on other expensive and 'dirty' power sources, often also subsidised.
  Much of the solar power being generated now is done on the rooftops of homes with the electricity being fed into the grid in return for Feed-in-Tariffs. There is a number of key benefits apart from the electricity generated; including reducing each solar home's environmental footprint, raising awareness of energy usage, driving behavioural change and building skills, investment and employment in the design, supply and installation of solar technology. As more and more homes
install solar systems, it is quite possible that, given the right political and economic environment (we already know we have enough sunshine), small scale solar systems will provide a meaningful percentage of future electricity needs. Importantly, we cannot underestimate the impact on behaviour that the presence of a solar system has in individual homes. In many homes, the awareness of energy usage generated by installing a solar power system leads to the adoption of long term energy saving strategies in the household, thereby multiplying the benefits of the system manyfold as power draw from the grid decreases. There has recently been much discussion about the benefits of using government subsidies to encourage homes to install solar systems. Traditional non-renewable power suppliers argue that small scale solar is too expensive, that government assistance channels funds away from other potential sources of renewable energy, and that the infrastructure is not designed for reverse feeds. Many of these arguments miss the basic point. While home solar systems may only be a small part of the environmental action we as a society need to be taking, it is however one of the most important components.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"THE state government has dissolved an Upper Hunter coal-seam gas committee, saying it was time for a statewide review of the way such committees operate.
Primary Industries Minister Steve Whan said he had dissolved the Bulga Community Consultative Committee because it was time for  a comprehensive review of the charter for consultative committees across NSW .
 But a spokeswoman for the minister confirmed last night that the Bulga committee was the only one being shut down.
 Yes, that's the only committee that's been dissolved but it's about what best reflects the area, nothing to do with the existing committee's actions,  Mr Whan's spokeswoman said.
The committee members were told of the decision during one of their regular meetings yesterday, a course of action that  outraged  committee member and Singleton councillor Alison Howlett.
Cr Howlett said it  seems more than a coincidence  that the letter from Mr Whan making the decision was dated November 16, a day after Singleton Council voted to restrict gas exploration in its local environmental plan.
 I'm not against coal-seam gas mining as such but we need a brake on some areas,  Cr Howlett said.
Committee observer and Hunter Valley Protection Alliance spokesman Graeme Gibson said the committee had been punished for its  robust discussions  over gas company AGL, which was exploring in the area.
Mr Gibson said the committee would meet again on February 7 despite Mr Whan's move to disband it.
Mr Whan said AGL's Hunter Gas Project used two exploration licences and ran from Newcastle to Scone and Merriwa.
A spokesman for AGL said the company remained committed to community consultation.
 We will remain open and transparent with the community about our activities while the review is undertaken,  he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"AGL Energy will begin producing liquefied natural gas at Newcastle in NSW by 2014 under plans lodged with the federal government.
AGL has proposed spending $300 million building a small-scale facility capable of producing about 130,000 tonnes a year of LNG.
 But unlike the other LNG facilities planned for construction near Gladstone in Queensland, plus the LNG plant proposed by coal seam gas company Eastern Star Gas elsewhere in Newcastle, AGL's LNG facility will not be for export.
Under the AGL plan, detailed in a submission to the federal Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, the plant will super cool gas until it converts into liquid.
The LNG will then be stored on site, where it will be used to top up domestic gas supplies during periods of high demand or supply problems. A similar storage facility is already in place in Victoria.
AGL has been working to boost its directly owned gas-reserve base in recent years, and is almost three- quarters of the way to achieving its stated target of a 2000 petajoule reserve base.
It is focusing its gas exploration efforts on the Gloucester Basin near Newcastle, including assets it acquired through its a series of deals in 2009 worth more than $540 million.
A spokesman for AGL said the proposed facility would store about two- weeks' worth of gas supplies for NSW and would ensure security of supply during periods of peak demand or disrupted supply.
 We need to know that our energy supply will be secure and capable of meeting our demands,  the spokesman said.
 AGL's Newcastle gas storage facility will address this need. 
Much of NSW's current gas supply is sourced from Queensland, although AGL and Eastern Star have set their sights on increasing the state's energy self-sufficiency.
The likelihood of a price on carbon emissions in the future means further investment in coal-fired power generation is unlikely, with lower emission gas-fired power set to grow in the medium term as a result.
AGL hopes to have the facility, which will be located at the Tomago industrial area, under construction by July 2011 and operating by winter 2014.
The plant is expected to generate up to 300 jobs during construction and around 15 permanent jobs once operational.
It will also include the capacity for the LNG to be transferred by tanker for use in heavy duty transport. LNG has been increasingly touted as an alternative fuel for long-distance haulage fleets as the volumes of east- coast gas reserves have grown in recent years.
The Newcastle plan is not the first time AGL has looked to set up a position in coal seam gas storage.
Earlier this year, the company spent $130 million buying Mosaic Oil for its depleted oil and gas reservoirs in Queensland.
AGL aims to turn those reservoirs into storage facilities capable of storing coal seam gas produced before the LNG export facilities planned for Gladstone are operational.
Despite its increasing gas production profile, analysts said AGL's next share price catalyst would be its participation in the NSW government's power privatisation process.
AGL, which already has a commanding position in the NSW electricity retailing market, is tipped to be a likely acquirer of at least one of the businesses up for sale.
Shares in AGL closed unchanged at $15.68 each.
KEY POINTS AGL is almost three-quarters of the way to achieving its directly owned reserve target. The facility will be able to store about two weeks' worth of gas supplies for NSW.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"NSW Primary Industries Minister, Steve Whan, intends to have a new Hunter Gas Community Consultative Commitee in place by early next year.
He decided to scrap the committee consulting with AGL Energy in the Bulga-Broke area, near Singleton, because of the widespread concern about coal seam gas exploration across the Hunter Valley.
  I am expecting to have the new committee actually up and running by the time of the next scheduled meeting of the Bulga group, which is February,  Mr Whan said.
 It was very clear to me that concerns about exploration for coal seam gas were much more widespread in the Hunter than just the Bulga area, 
 So what I am trying to do is provide an opportunity for a constructive forum covering all the areas where AGL has exploration licences in the Hunter Valley. 
The decision to dissolve the Bulga-Broke committee has angered local residents who plan to continue holding the community consultation meetings.
The group representing the communities, the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance (HVPA), argues with the NSW Parliament about to conclude ahead of the state election, a moritorium must be placed on coal seam gas exploration.
 Now is the time to put that in place, what Whan has done here is proof that we are desparately in need of a moritorium because this is off the rails,  HVPA chief executive, John Thomson said.
 This is an outraged community, 
 To be told that we're not going to have a forum in which we can try and have some sort of consultation, at this stage, when the Government is going off on an end of year break and then heading into an election is just totally untenable.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"WOODSIDE has confirmed that the start of its Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia will be pushed out by six months to August and cost an extra $900 million.
But it says it is  confused  over market sentiment that its Browse LNG project in the Kimberley will suffer a similar fate.
 The company has also admitted it was kept in the dark regarding the decision of its major shareholder, Shell, to sell 10 per cent of its stake in Woodside last month, saying a  better way  of divestment could have been found.
Speaking at Woodside's annual investor update, chief executive Don Voelte said costs for Pluto would increase from $13.1 billion to $14 billion as some flare towers, overseen by principal engineering contractors Foster Wheeler and WorleyParsons, needed to be rebuilt so they could withstand expected wind speeds.
Mr Voelte said Woodside was  very disappointed  with the delay, which would mean the first LNG cargo would be deployed in September.
 There are remedies available, not insurance-related, but they may relate to design,  he said.  I can't get away from the fact that we are very disappointed with the news.
 However, from a project point of view, what we tried was unheard of in the LNG industry; a mega-project, accelerated, to put us into a leading competitive advantage. Even with this delay, we still have that advantage . . . 76 months from discovery to production is unheard of. A world record, by years. 
Moody's Investors Service was unimpressed, saying Woodside's rating was on negative outlook  mainly due to execution challenges associated with Pluto .
 (This) announcement, which is on top of the previous cost overrun announced in November 2009, places additional pressure on the company's credit profile,  said Moody's vice-president, Ian Lewis.
Mr Voelte rejected suggestions that its $30 billion Browse joint venture would also miss deadlines due to conflict within the joint venture, as well as environmental and indigenous concerns.
 This is the one that confuses us,  he said.  We love Browse. We love the way that it is going and we hear things that are said about it which are basically not true.
 We know exactly where we stand and we see no roadblocks.
 The project remains on track to enter [front-end engineering and design] in early 2011. We don't see anything that won't allow us to build at James Price Point. 
Mr Voelte said comments by BHP Billiton last week that the project was still in concept-selection phase were  absolutely wrong  and that Browse would also have to meet Woodside's values before proceeding.
On Shell's decision to sell its shareholding in Woodside, a typically hairy-chested Mr Voelte said  we don't need 'em. If they had of talked to us, we probably would have had a little bit of a better way to go . . . but it was . . . their right.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"THEY once stretched into the skies north of the home of Australian liquid natural gas, Karratha, on the Burrup Peninsula.
``They'' were a pair of flare stacks vital to the safe and effective management of Woodside's almost completed $14 billion Pluto project.
 I say ``were'' because pretty soon they will be dust and scrap metal, because Woodside's twin towers were ``under-designed'' for the winds of Western Australia's north-west coast and are in the process of being hauled down.
The decision to scrap the sibling flare stacks, the senior one standing 130 metres tall, has resulted in a six-month delay in Pluto coming on-stream -- and another $900 million blowout in project costs and another small but meaningful dent in the reputation of the Woodside Petroleum project management team.
The really frustrating thing about the flare stack debacle is that they are not a particularly expensive or exotic piece of kit.
As a barely contrite Woodside boss Don Voelte explained yesterday, the flawed Pluto stacks were effectively bought off the shelf from the world's only serious stack designer and maker at a cost of about $50m.
And, according to Voelte, the fact the stacks didn't meet Woodside's clearly expressed specs for wind resistance suggests there might be problems elsewhere in the LNG world where this same kit has been used.
The issue here for Woodside is not so much the cost of actually replacing the stacks, but rather the time it is going to eat up.
Pluto gas was supposed to start flowing to customers from April next year.
But courtesy of the stack problem and a collection of other niggling issues that Voelte says would have seen the project delayed but less dramatically, those contracted customers will see nothing from Pluto until September.
But they will still get their gas. And that is where the real cost is here. Woodside is going to have to buy gas on the open market to meet its contracts.
Continued on Page 40
Continued from Page 39
Voelte admitted yesterday the delay was a disappointment and he accepted that its cause was ``a miss'' by Woodside and its contractors, Foster Wheelan and Worley Parsons.
Typically, though, Nebraska's own was quick to assert the Pluto positives. ``What we tried was unheard off in the industry -- a fast-tracked mega-project. An August start-up just 49 months from FID (final investment decision) fits well with the 48 months that is a world-class schedule. But just 76 months from discovery to production, that is unheard of -- a world record.''
Voelte was asked whether the delay would change the timetable for his own retirement from Woodside, which is expected in the first half of next year. His response was as brusque as it was informative. ``I am not dead yet,'' he said before noting that he had given his board a lot of flexibility on the timing, that the external search was under way and that he would only leave when a replacement was in situ and a proper transition was completed. But Voelte's timing has nothing to do with start-up at Pluto or key dates for any of the other projects on Woodside's current slate. In other words, as soon as the board is ready, so it will be.
One final point of interest in yesterday's annual investor briefing was that Voelte used the event to further air the corrosive tension that continues to build between Woodside and its partners in the Browse project. That list includes three oil majors (Chevron, BP and Shell) and a very big part-timer in the form of BHP Billiton.
The problem at Browse is that Woodside and the state government are committed to processing the gas at a $50bn plant to be built at a piece of northern beachfront called James Price Point. That would trouble no one but for the fact that it is on the Kimberley coast and for many, including some of the partners, that makes it is big no-no.
Voelte yesterday took umbrage at comments made by the chief executive of one of his partners at a recent AGM. Voelte said that the unnamed CEO had indicated that Browse was still in ``concept selection''.
Now Voelte was clearly referring to BHP's Marius Kloppers and the commentary he offered on Browse at a recent AGM in Perth. And doubtless some of what Kloppers said would have irritated the Woodside team, not least some commentary that inferred that there were elements of the existing proposal that sat outside of BHP's operational values. But Kloppers actually made no mention of where Browse was at, nor where it was headed, beyond saying that the call was currently in the court of the project operator and that it would be up to the partners to either agree to Woodside's plan or not.
In fact, the idea that BHP reckons ``concept selection'' is still an open debate goes back to September and a briefing delivered by the Global Australian's straight-talking petroleum boss, Michael Yeager, who said: ``Right now we are doing the work in order to meet the Australian government's requirements, about $1.25bn worth of work over the next several years to meet our requirements, as we develop our basis of design and get ready to have a concept selection here.''
Woodside's real beef is that it is being dogged by rumours about the state of play at Browse and it reckons some of the partners, most notably BHP, are feeding that destabilisation. Apparently a rumour ran up and down St Georges Terrace recently that Woodside had gone off James Price Point and that another more southern site had been identified at the right place for an LNG village.
Voelte took the opportunity yesterday to stomp on those rumours and to assert control over the destiny of the Browse project.
Voelte opened his riposte by indicating that the continuing chatter about Browse that ``confuses us a little bit''.
``We love Browse, we love where it is going and we hear things that are said about it that just, basically, are not true. As operator, as the one that is talking to government, as the one that is talking to the traditional owners of the land, as the one that is talking to the Greens and to the NGOs, we know exactly where we are at and we see no road blocks,'' he said.
``The basis of design is now complete . . . with active participation by all our joint venture partners. We are meeting with members of the Greens party, meeting with people that are opposed to the project, the traditional owners that are supportive of it, and we don't see any obstacles that we can't overcome at this time. We are on schedule against the Browse retention lease conditions.''
There's the rub as far as Woodside is concerned. It is on track to meet the state and federal government requirements for the retention of the lease that covers the massive Browse gas find. The way Woodside sees it, while the operator and the government can sustain an argument that there is a commercial proposal, the partners in Browse have little option now but to support the progress to a project in the Kimberly or surrender their share of the lease, because they will have failed to meet the retention lease conditions.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WOODSIDE Petroleum's cost blowout at the Pluto liquefied natural gas project on Western Australia's Burrup Peninsula has doubled to $2 billion, as substandard flare towers and mechanical problems add to previous labour issues to delay first LNG by six months.
The Pluto project, which will now cost $14bn, joins a host of Pilbara mega-projects being hit by development cost rises and delays as mining and energy giants ramp up activity in the iron ore and gas-rich region.
 Woodside also said 2011 production, not including that from Pluto, would drop by up to 13 per cent because of planned production outages at two of its major offshore oilfields in the North West Shelf.
Estimated development costs at Pluto have jumped from a November 2009 estimate of between $12.7bn and $13.1bn and the original estimate of $12bn made in 2007.
The first LNG shipment has been delayed from a March 2011 target to September 2011.
The Pluto find was brought to a development decision in record time, and Woodside had planned a similar record development of the plant.
If Pluto meets its current timetable, it will still have been brought on quickly by world standards.
``We are disappointed,'' Woodside chief executive Don Voelte said yesterday. ``What we tried to do was unheard of in the industry -- we didn't quite make it, but it is still a satisfying project.''
In its release, Woodside blamed the delay on contractor Foster Wheeler/WorleyParsons installing flare towers that did not meet wind strength specifications and said they would need to be replaced.
But in an investor briefing, Mr Voelte said there had been other mechanical issues that would have delayed the LNG plant even if the towers had been to specification.
Mr Voelte said Woodside was pursuing ``potential remedies'' from the contractor, who used an ``off-the-shelf'' design that did not comply with Woodside's specifications. ``They've used this flare tower design, we understand, in other applications around the world, so there's probably bigger concerns than just Pluto,'' Mr Voelte said.
Woodside had flagged the flare tower problems and the potential for delays and cost blowouts in July, which had contributed to shares touching a 16-month closing low of $40.56 last week.
Yesterday's certainty over the delays helped underpin a rebound in the shares, which closed up 24c at $41.95. The first Pluto production train is planned as the start of an LNG hub where future trains will process either Woodside's or third-party gas.
Mr Voelte said Woodside was confident it would find enough gas for a second train to start production in 2014.
He said Woodside's equity stake in a second train would be between 90 and 95 per cent, although there was potential to change this if a third-party gas deal was struck.
Woodside said 2010 production was likely to be in the middle of previous guidance of between 70 and 75 million barrels of oil equivalent, but that 2011 output -- not including Pluto -- would slip to between 63 and 66 million barrels.
Pluto will add between 5 million and 9 million barrels of production next year.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said the lower production in the base business was a cause for concern, but that it was somewhat offset by the higher equity stake in the next Pluto train.
He lowered his price target from $53.55 to $52.10, but kept his ``buy'' recommendation.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"WOODSIDE Petroleum bucked the slide on the broader market yesterday, despite revealing a blow-out in the cost and a delay of six months on its Pluto liquefied natural gas project.
As the Australian sharemarket slid to a two-month low on Europe's sovereign debt woes and lower commodity prices, Woodside's shares firmed 24c to $41.95.
 Woodside revealed that its Pluto project, off Western Australia, had been hit by a $900 million cost blow-out, with the delay blamed mainly on the need to replace flare towers used to burn off excess gas at the site.
The market had anticipated a cost overrun but the 7 per cent rise in Pluto's price tag to $14 billion was worse than expected.
But analysts were encouraged by Woodside's progress on a planned second LNG train.
The benchmark ASX200 Index ended down 34.1 points at 4584.4, with resource stocks taking the brunt of the falls.
Market heavyweight BHP Billiton lost 50c, or 1.16 per cent, to $42.74, while rival Rio Tinto fell $1.63, or 1.94 per cent, to $82.21.
Ord Minnett private client adviser Jon Hancock said fears of escalating debt woes in Europe along with market expectations of a contraction in Australia's GDP growth would ensure the absence of a Santa Claus rally before Christmas.
GDP data for the September quarter, due out today, was likely to show growth has slowed about 0.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent for the year, economists said.
A startling $2.4 billion widening of the nation's current account deficit in the September quarter prompted analysts to slash their forecasts.
At $7.8 billion, the gap between what the nation spends on imports and what it earns for exports was $1 billion more than pundits had estimated.
``The current account deficit remains low by historical standards at 2.3 per cent of GDP, but we expect it to widen further next year as around half of the investment in large gas projects will be imported,'' Citi economist Paul Brennan said.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,4,"WOODSIDE Petroleum says costs for its Pluto liquefied natural gas project have blown out by $900 million and it will take another six months to begin production while it rebuilds equipment that falls short of design specifications.
The oil and gas producer says the Pluto project, offshore from Karratha in Western Australia, will cost $14 billion, up 6.9 per cent from its prior estimate of $13.1 billion.
 Woodside is rebuilding several towers used to burn off waste gas because it says they do not meet design requirements to withstand expected wind speeds.
Woodside shares were up 24c at $41.95.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Woodside Petroleum investors were braced for some bad news on the flagship Pluto liquefied natural gas project yesterday, and chief executive Don Voelte delivered.
The latest $14 billion budget for the project is almost 15 per cent above the original estimate and the start-up will be about eight months late. But it wasn't all negative, as reflected in the resilience of Woodside's share price yesterday, which admittedly had taken a battering in the past few weeks.
 Even before the latest cost overrun, the first train of Pluto was set to count among Australia's most expensive LNG projects in terms of dollars per tonne of capacity, ahead of Chevron's giant $43 billion Gorgon venture.
Now that cost climbs again to a level not far off what Citigroup ranks as the most expensive, Inpex's complex Ichthys venture.
Voelte insisted yesterday the single-train project was still  very viable  and provided a springboard for future expansion. That long-awaited second train, when it comes, is widely expected to be much more profitable.
But doubts linger over returns from Pluto 1. At the time of the final investment decision in July 2007 for the then $12 billion project, Voelte gave the rate of return at 10 to 15 per cent. Now it can only be lower. It is not just the higher costs for Pluto 1 that will hit Woodside next year but the delayed start-up, now set for August 2011.
Woodside is having to source some alternative supplies to meet its contractual obligations to its two customers. The news has disappointed but not particularly surprised the market. Most affected perhaps is Woodside's self-regard for LNG project delivery.
Still, it is important to remember that Pluto remains a world-beater among LNG projects in terms of the time between discovery and start-up. In terms of mega-projects, it also stacks up â€“ at least so far. According to Voelte, not one of the projects worldwide categorised as mega-projects over the past two years has passed all three success criteria set by consultancy Independent Project Analysis on costs, timing and production.
Pluto, while yet to prove itself on the production side, should still make the grade. Woodside is estimating 2011 output from the first train ranging from 5 million to 9 million barrels of oil equivalent, depending on the ramp-up.
With Australia's LNG boom still in its early stages, Woodside's problems at Pluto 1 will be a cause for concern for those such as Chevron, BG and Santos, which have it all still in front of them.
For Woodside investors, yesterday's update on the closely watched Pluto expansion was more positive. While the company had little to report on negotiations with third parties for additional gas, confidence is growing that Woodside's exploration program has yielded enough success to underpin a second train by itself.
Voelte is still talking of a late 2014 date to start up a second train, now to be at least 90 per cent owned by Woodside after its recent buyout of Hess from a key Carnarvon Basin permit that will supply some of the gas.
The stake is higher than the 60 to 75 per cent Woodside had previously been expected to hold, making the project more valuable.
But the continuing delay in the expansion only heightens the risk that Pluto 2 will clash with Gorgon in a constrained market for skilled labour in Western Australia.
On Woodside's other growth projects there was little to cheer investors. As much as Voelte details progress towards the $30 billion Browse project, the market remains unconvinced about the support from Woodside's partners.
And on Sunrise, there was nothing to change the view that progress on getting East Timor's approval remains slow.
Until there is evidence to the contrary, the market will continue to ascribe little value to Woodside's longer-term growth potential.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A liquefied natural gas (LNG) company says it believes all major gas projects planned for Gladstone, in central Queensland, can survive in their own right.
Three LNG projects have been approved by the Queensland Government and two have been given the go ahead by the Federal Government, while a number of others are also in the planning stages.
 That has led to speculation that some projects may have to merge to be viable.
But the project director of Australia Pacific LNG, Page Maxson, told a Brisbane business function the success of his company indicates they all should be able to stand up on their own.
 We've got the largest reserve base of any of them that's out there,  he said.
 We've been here the longest, been producing coal seam gas for quite some time, currently produce about 35 per cent of Queensland's gas needs here.
 I don't think it's a question of whether each one can go on their own, they certainly can and everybody is moving forward under that basis. 
Mr Maxson says Australia Pacific LNG is working towards an investment decision by its board.
 We're continuing to make significant long lead commitments out in the marketplace necessary to maintain our schedule and we're also continuing our discussions with some customers, an important part of the whole scheme here on the export market,  he said.
 When all those things come together, that's when we'll go to our board and take that formal final investment approval. 
'Remarkable investment'
Premier Anna Bligh told the function the sheer size of the LNG resource is yet to be fully understand across Australia and Queensland.
 The three companies that are looking to start construction next year will between them invest $40 billion over the next four years between the Surat Basin and Gladstone,  she said.
 $40 billion in four years, it's a remarkable investment.
 They will employ a construction workforce between them of 12,000 people, that will have an operational workforce of 6,000.
 It will see the construction of 450-kilometre pipelines connecting a gas resource in the Surat Basin that is as big as the Gorgon project in Western Australia - connect that to up to eight production trains on Curtis Island.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A federal MP says more people are worried about the rapid growth of the coal seam gas sector in Queensland and its effect on water than the State Government's Wild Rivers laws.
A proposed Wild Rivers declaration for the Cooper Creek system is expected in the next month, with consultation to extend into 2011.
 A federal parliamentary committee is examining the impact of the laws and the likely effect of changes in a private member's bill proposed by Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott.
Maranoa MP Bruce Scott says he will not support more state regulation on landholders.
However, he says there is more concern about the impact of coal seam gas projects on the Great Artesian Basin.
 The Great Artesian Basin and the water aquifers there - it's our Great Barrier Reef,  he said.
 Now they wouldn't let mining operations on the Great Barrier Reef because of community outrage and rightly there should not be.
 The Great Artesian Basin I believe fits into that category - it is the lifeblood of our community and we've got to treat it so it'll be here for another thousand years. 
Mr Scott says there could be a flow-on effect if Mr Abbott's private member's bill to overturn the state laws is passed in the Federal Parliament.
 It's not that we don't want to protect the environment, landholders want to do that, communities want to do that,  he said.
 If we are able to get Tony Abbott's private member's bill up, I've already written to Mr Abbott wanting to see whether we could extend that into the Lake Eyre Basin.
 I think that would be an important way of dealing with what I think are unnecessary laws.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Civil libertarians say there are no safeguards on police taking photos of peaceful protesters in Queensland.
Anti-coal seam gas protesters say they were photographed last week by a police officer.
 Queensland Civil Liberties Council vice president Terry O'Gorman says there are no checks and balances on that.
He says State Parliament's Crime and Misconduct Committee (CMC) only audits covert recordings of criminal activity.
 Parliamentary committee never has and never will have any monitoring role about police photographing people who are not committing any sort of offence at a public demonstration,  he said.
Police Minister Neil Roberts says it is not usual for photos to be taken.
 In the south-east corner of Queensland police help facilitate protests,  he said.
 It's not routine operations for them to take photographs in those instances. 
However, Mr O'Gorman wants the CMC to look into the matter.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"QGC's Kenya Station near Tara was the centre of protest action last week when a number of alliance groups gathered to voice their concerns on coal seam gas mining.
Protesters from the Western Downs Alliance, Dulacca Action group, Drillham and Friends of the Earth blockaded QGC trucks and picketed the station last Friday.
 In a sometimes bitter but mostly peaceful rally, a number of protesters knocked down the Kenya plants front gate and a protester punched signs in anger at the prospect of gas companies coming onto their properties.
Western Downs Alliance spokesperson Dane Pratzky said the protesters were there to show solidarity with the landholders.
â€œThe gas companies are not welcome throughout the estates,â€? he said.
â€œIt has been forced upon most of the people so we'll be holding them out of the estates at any cost.â€?
Western Downs Alliance's Michael Brederick was angered at the prospect of gas companies coming onto their land and promised a campaign of civil disobedience.
â€œWe are here to announce we have declared the Tara estates a gas free zone and that all gas mining activities are from now on prohibited,â€? he said.
â€œI'm not against coal seam gas mining; it's about the contamination of the water and the effects it will have on landholders.â€?
Dulacca Action group spokesperson Lee McNichol handed a letter to QGC Kenya plant employees and said protesters had to remain cool and rational.
â€œPeople are getting quite emotional about this because you've invested your lives in these properties,â€? he said.
â€œThe information just isn't out there for this  suck it and see  experiment with the artesian basin.â€?
Mr McNichol's letter quoted the Coordinator General's report which raised questions about the environmental impact to residents in the Tara-Chinchilla area.
QGC spokesman Mark Todd said the action group had only quoted selectively from the report.
â€œThis is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country with 1500 conditions that have to be met,â€? he said.
â€œThere are set conditions to make sure the project is environmentally and socially acceptable.â€?
Mr Todd said the protest did not hinder QGC's project with misconceptions being spread in the media about the Tara project.
â€œDrew Hutton said recently that we were going to start drilling in the Tara area when we weren't,â€? he said.
â€œIt was unnecessarily inflammatory and demonstrably incorrect to say that.â€?
Meanwhile, the State Government is setting up a 36 member  enforcement unit  to deal with some of the farmer and environmental concerns surrounding the coal seam gas industry.
The unit will include environmental and groundwater experts, gas safety and petroleum specialists and land access experts.
Mr Todd said QGC in general welcomes any move by the State Government that can increase confidence in the industry.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"Leader of the Queensland Party Aidan McLindon's attempt to impose a moratorium on coal seam gas development was rejected in Parliament last week.
The independent told State Parliament there should be a halt on new gas projects until the full impacts of coal seam gas developments were fully understood and mitigated.
 Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton agreed the moratorium was necessary.
â€œAt this stage neither the government nor the CSG industry know what impact their activities will have on underground water, surface water, the health of local communities or agricultural land and a moratorium is necessary to fully assess these factors,â€? he said.
â€œAdaptive management, as the government uses the term, means let's allow the companies to experiment with the Queensland environment and if they cause serious damage, then we'll change the condition.â€?

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE boom that has the potential to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into regional Queensland, as the state's coal seam gas industry gears up to service export markets in Asia, is already making itself felt.
And there were cheers on the Darling Downs this week when Dalby-based civil engineering firm Ostwald Bros picked up a contract for civil works with QGC, a subsidiary of the UK's BG Group.
 QGC is gearing up to build what will probably be the first liquefied natural gas plant at Gladstone.
Ostwald - which keyed into the fledgling CSG industry in its early days and has already seen significant growth - expects its work from a variety of other QGC civil engineering contracts to add $60 million to its turnover over the next year or so.
Ostwald, established by chief executive Brendan Ostwald and his family 20 years ago based its early success on rural industries.
It developed the likes of cattle feed-lots and cotton irrigation projects - as well as general civil engineering works.
But it quickly identified CSG and its spin-offs as new source of growth as the industry got under way a decade ago and, among other projects, worked with the now Shell-PetroChina-controlled Arrow Energy and ERM Power on the Braemar power stations they built outside Dalby.
Mr Ostwald declined to put an exact figure on the new QGC contract yesterday - not wanting to provide any commercial secrets to competitors.
But Mr Ostwald expects that with other contracts the group already has in hand its revenue from its relationship with QGC may well top the $60 million figure by some tens of millions as QGC ramps up the gas production it will need to service its planned Curtis Island LNG plant.
The new QGC contract, together with ongoing work for Origin Energy, Rio Tinto, Xstrata - particularly at its ambitious Wandoan coal project - and Wesfarmers is expected to see Ostwald increase its workforce from just over 400 at present to around 500.
And most, like the company's current workforce, will be locals, Mr Ostwald says, ensuring that a good deal of the cash generated by the new contracts will feed into the local community.

From P61
Locals to get a good deal
That's an outcome Mr Ostwald believes will be a key to the longer term acceptance of the CSG industry, whose sudden appearance on the scene has led to significant suspicion among land owners across the prospective Surat Basin gas fields which will largely feed at least the initial LNG plants on Gladstone's Curtis Island.
Mr Ostwald, whose family also farms, believes the vocal opposition that has hit the CSG industry will eventually subside - particularly if the big CSG companies make sure they share the expected largesse with local communities.
And he has already noted plenty of positive spin-offs.
``Injune was flat five years ago. Now there are motels and coffee shops,'' he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"News of a global strategic co-operation deal between Shell and Gazprom has raised the question of whether a door has opened for the Russian gas giant's long-held ambitions to gain a foothold in Australia's booming liquefied natural gas sector.
International Shell projects in which Gazprom might participate have yet to be identified, but Gazprom chairman Alexey Miller voiced expectations of  new large-scale contracts and growing joint presence in new markets .
 Shell's broad portfolio offers a multitude of opportunities, but Gazprom deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev has made no secret of Gazprom's wish to co-operate with Australian companies on LNG supply.
One possibility involves a gas swap arrangement that would enable Gazprom to increase shipments to its Asian customers, such as Korea Gas Corp, with LNG sourced from third parties, supplementing exports from its Sakhalin-2 plant in eastern Russia, where Shell is already a partner.
Shell is developing something of a track record of co-operation with national oil companies in Australia and sealed the joint $3.45 billion takeover of Arrow Energy with PetroChina in August.
Elsewhere in resources land, you could call it the curious case of the disappearing Viking. Shares in oil and gas play Nexus Energy are continuing to record exceptionally high turnover.
Another 37 million shares, or 3.7 per cent of the company, changed hands yesterday on Wednesday.
It marks the sixth straight day of unusually high turnover. Some 193.2 million shares, or more than 19 per cent of the company, have traded over the past six sessions at an average of 32.2 million shares a day. That compares to average daily volumes in the year before that of 6.7 million shares a day.
Nexus said on Tuesday it understood its major shareholder, Norway-based Viking Shipping, had recently sold the majority if not all of its Nexus shares. Adding to the intrigue was Nexus's comment that it believed Viking had been  obliged to sell its shares by its financiers .
If that is the case, then yesterday's Wednesday's trade should have flushed out the last of the Viking stock. It has certainly taken some of the spark out of Nexus's share price, which has fallen from 52.5Â¢ to as low as 43.5Â¢ since the big volumes started changing hands.
Given Nexus has been regularly touted as a takeover target, there could be an interesting substantial shareholder notice or two in the next few days.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte may not repeat his feat of collecting one of the 10 largest bonuses paid in Australia last year after the latest cost blowout at the Pluto liquefied natural gas project.
Mr Voelte collected a short-term incentive cash bonus of more than $3 million, as the first $1 billion blowout on the now $14 billion Pluto project was countered by a 27Â per cent gain in Woodside's share price.
 But governance experts said Mrâ€ŠVoelte could struggle this year given the share price is down 12 per cent and given the factors against which the short-term incentive is judged. According to Woodside's annual report, Mrâ€ŠVoelte's eligibility for the bonus is measured against factors like the pursuit and execution of the company's growth agenda, enhancing the company's culture and reputation and ensuring shareholder focus. Governance experts said that he appeared to have fallen short on at least some of those measures.
Since Pluto was approved for development in July 2007, the budget has overrun by $2 billion and the production schedule has slipped by nine months.
A senior governance adviser with a major institutional investment group, who did not want to be named, said if the Woodside, which has a December year end, had structured its remuneration policy appropriately, Mrâ€ŠVoelte's bonus would take a hit.
 Where there's a situation with a major cost blowout, being CEO he would be responsible for the management of that .â€Š.â€Š. and I would expect to see an impact on STI,  the adviser said.
 If there's not, then the structures that are put forward aren't working. 
A failure to reflect that result, the expert said, could lead to a vote against the remuneration report and the chair of the remuneration committee, who in the case of Woodside is director Din Megat.
Mr Voelte, who has announced plans to leave in the second half of 2011 â€“ has a's short-term bonus has ranked among the biggest paid in corporate Australia in recent years.
According to research by ISS Governance Services for the Australian Council of Super Investors, Mr Voelte's bonus ranked in the top 10 for the country.
Some 67 per cent of his annual total potential remuneration is at risk under short- and long-term incentives.
Any cuts to Mr Voelte's bonus are likely to be deeper than that to other Woodside executives, whose bonuses are linked to such matters as safety, production, operating expenditure and peer-group performance.
Barring a dramatic turnaround in the final weeks of this year, it looks unlikely that there will be a positive share price return this year.
Woodside shares fell 66Â¢ yesterday to close at $41.29, compared with its price of $47.20 at the start of the year.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"SINCE the 1970s every rural community in Queensland has experienced the same decline. Populations have reduced, businesses have closed and kids have been forced to go to the city for a career.
Now with the realisation that much of central and southern inland Queensland sits atop a world class coal seam gas energy resource that can provide cleaner energy to the world, that decline has slowly started to be reversed | for some communities at least.
 I believe that the constant negativity and what can only be described at times as scaremongering is creating unnecessary anxiety and fear in much of the rural community and preventing us from pursuing the opportunities the coming development will present.
So I believe it is time for a reality check on the CSG issue.
The reality is that the CSG industry is not new to Queensland. It has operated quite successfully for over 10 years in an area from Moura to south of Chinchilla and west to Roma and Injune. A significant part of that area including some of the first fields developed at Dawson, Scotia and Peat are in my electorate of Callide.
As far as I am aware over that 10- year period no landholders have been ruined by the CSG industry operating on their properties. There are many hundreds of landholders who have negotiated access agreements with gas companies. Some have done so reluctantly but some have negotiated an agreement that now provides a valuable income source for their farming business.
Neither am I aware of any water aquifer that has been destroyed or any landholder who has lost their water supply and after 10 years those affects should by now be apparent. I am aware of many landholders who have access to additional water supplies and there are even some new irrigation schemes where none previously existed.
There is no indication that I can see that the food producing capacity of the area has been reduced since CSG production began. The reality is that if given access to a little more money and a little more water I would back every landholder I know to produce more food than they did in the past.
There have undoubtedly been some difficulties especially in the early days. Some of the gas companies and their contractors have engaged in conduct that should never be repeated but those incidents have been in the minority.
The State Government has been slow to act to change some of the outdated legislation but with the constant urging of the LNP Opposition they are finally catching up and the parliament has passed a range of new legislation including new land access laws and new requirements for mandatory conduct and compensation agreements.
Last week in the parliament a Bill was passed to manage the underground water issue and protect the bores of landholders and other existing water users. During the debate I moved 14 amendments to the government's Bill to try to strengthen those protections for landholders. The minister could make no argument against five of our amendments and we will continue to pursue the other issues.
In particular we will continue to propose that a new statutory authority be appointed by the parliament called the Gasfields Land and Water Authority to oversee the new laws.
The Labor Government has given that role to the Queensland Water Commission based in Brisbane and I will continue to argue that there should be a new authority of which local landholder and local government leaders can be part to fulfil this critical oversight role.
The LNP has a policy for the management of the new industry and our policy will continue to grow and address new issues as the industry grows. We will continue to pursue change in the regulations when the need is identified and we are constantly seeking suggestions about what changes are necessary. I gave a solid commitment in the parliament last week that in government we would amend whatever legislation we need to take whatever action was required at the first verifiable case of landholders rights being lost or water pollution or land degradation occurring.
We have long recognised that there are a range of issues such as land access, water extraction and regional infrastructure that have to be dealt with properly and some of them are difficult and complex. The reality however is that dealing with those often complex issues is only made harder by the current atmosphere of anxiety and fear.
There is no doubt that the CSG industry presents rural Queenslanders with a huge challenge. The greatest challenge will be ensuring that the people who are impacted the most | rural and regional Queenslanders | are able to get our fair share of the huge economic benefit that will flow to the state from this new industry.
To achieve that we have to maintain a creditable voice and a creditable position. We should never allow ourselves to be used by the serial environmental alarmists in their quest to rid the world of fossil fuels nor should we become trapped in the mind numbing world of the conspiracy theorists.
Our community leaders | including me | need to be honest and up front with people and not try to mis-represent what the real issues are for our landholders and our communities.
We need to clearly and creditably define what those issues are and then we have to find solutions to those issues or be able to prevent them from developing if no solutions are possible. Once again anxiety and fear do not help in that process.
I am confident that the people of regional Queensland, the landholders and the local government leaders especially are smart enough and resourceful enough to take on this challenge and make the lives of the next generation of regional Queenslanders better because of the opportunities it presents.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"THE American film-maker behind the movie Gasland has defended his film against gas industry claims it is inaccurate and has no relevance to Australian conditions.
Gasland, which is now showing in Australia, catalogues a variety of environmental and human health impacts claimed to be linked to natural gas production and hydraulic fracturing procedures in the United States.
 In one film-defining scene, a kitchen sink erupts into flames after a householder holds a lit cigarette lighter beside a tap of running water.
The documentary says the pheno-menon is caused when methane is forced from gas beds into freshwater aquifers as a result of hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking' | a gas-extraction procedure in which a mix of water, sand and chemicals is blasted at high pressure into subterranean coal seams to free up trapped gases.
In response, the US gas industry has stated that there has never been an officially proven case of hydraulic fracturing causing contamination of freshwater in the US, and has attributed the phenomenon of flammable tap water to the presence of naturally occurring methane in water.
Throughout his film, Josh Fox meets many Americans from hydraulic fracturing zones who argue those points, ranging from people with brain tumours and other serious health issues to those with sick and dying animals. All attribute their close proximity to gas-extraction activities and loopholes in the US regulatory system as the cause of their problems.
In recent weeks, Mr Fox has been touring Australia with his camera to document landholder reactions to the rapidly growing coal seam gas industry here.
Mr Fox told Queensland Country Life in Brisbane last week that what he had seen here was  mind-blowing .
Many similarities existed between the gas industries in the US and Australia, he said, including landholders  being bulldozed  by mining companies, government regulations weighted strongly in favour of miners, and residents being exposed to  a chemically contaminated future .
However, one key difference was the low level of financial compensation Australian landholders were receiving in comparison to their US counterparts, he said. Mr Fox himself was offered $100,000 by a gas company four years ago in return for exploration rights to his family's property in Delaware, the event that triggered his initial curiosity about the industry.
 What is also surprising to me is that this is gas for export,  Mr Fox said of the large coal seam gas to liquid natural gas projects recently approved in Queensland.  You're selling your future for a few billion dollars | it is really nonsensical. 
Like the kitchen taps in his movie, Mr Fox fires up when confronted with claims by Australian gas industry group APPEA that his US-based movie has no relevance here.
 Of course it is applicable,  he said.  You're talking about fracking; you're talking about gas drilling, and in many cases doing it in the coal beds, which is how it started in the US, by the way.
 There is a pattern here. It started in the US that way and then it moved towards deeper formations. And once the industry is entrenched, they will go on to lower formations, and then they will find shales, and then tight sands, and then they will find something else to frack. But the point is that in coal seams, you are closer to the aquifer, so the issues are actually more severe here than they are in the US. 
He described groups such as APPEA in Australia and Energy in Depth in the US as  the PR wings of the gas industry , behind which energy companies hid as they attempted to discredit those who raised concerns about their industry, such as through the 'Debunking Gasland' document.
 The energy companies are not even brave enough to come out from behind their desks and identify themselves as the people doing this,  he said.  They have to hire a third party and hire these bogus apologists for an industry that is running amok all over the place. 
Mr Fox said he could empathise with farmers who were risking fines of up to $60,000 and jail time by lock-ing their gates to mining companies.
 The thing that is perhaps most infuriating about it is that you are lit-erally cornering these people | push-ing them up against the wall to the point that they have no recourse but to put themselves under threat of arrest and threat of financial ruin just to keep their own properties,  Mr Fox said.
 This lock-the-gate campaign is really bold, and I'm sure this is going to be very inspiring for people in the United States. 
Mr Fox said some landholders had attempted to lock their gates against mining companies in the US but had not succeeded because they were not working in a concerted campaign with other landholders.
 For this to work you need to have a lot of people working on this all at once, because otherwise each person is very vulnerable,  he said.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"SINCE the 1970s every rural community in Queensland has experienced the same decline. Populations have reduced, businesses have closed and kids have been forced to go to the city for a career.
Now with the realisation that much of central and southern inland Queensland sits atop a world class coal seam gas energy resource that can provide cleaner energy to the world that decline has slowly started to be reversed for some communities at least.
 I believe that the constant negativity and what can only be described at times as scaremongering is creating unnecessary anxiety and fear in much of the rural community and preventing us from pursuing the opportunities the coming development will present.
So I believe it is time for a reality check on the CSG issue.
The reality is that the CSG industry is not new to Queensland. It has operated quite successfully for over 10 years in an area from Moura to south of Chinchilla and west to Roma and Injune. A significant part of that area including some of the first fields developed at Dawson, Scotia and Peat are in my electorate of Callide.
As far as I am aware over that 10 year period no landholders have been ruined by the CSG industry operating on their properties. There are many hundreds of landholders who have negotiated access agreements with gas companies. Some have done so reluctantly but some have negotiated an agreement that now provides a valuable income source for their farming business.
Neither am I aware of any water aquifer that has been destroyed or any landholder that has lost their water supply and after 10 years those affects should by now be apparent. I am aware of many landholders who have access to additional water supplies and there are even some new irrigation schemes where none previously existed.
There is no indication that I can see that the food producing capacity of the area has been reduced since CSG production began. The reality is that if given access to a little more money and a little more water I would back every landholder I know to produce more food than they did in the past.
There have undoubtedly been some difficulties especially in the early days. Some of the gas companies and their contractors have engaged in conduct that should never be repeated but those incidents have been in the minority.
The State Government has been slow to act to change some of the outdated legislation but with the constant urging of the LNP Opposition they are finally catching up and the Parliament has passed a range of new legislation including new land access laws and new requirements for mandatory conduct and compensation agreements.
Last week in the Parliament a Bill was passed to manage the underground water issue and protect the bores of landholders and other existing water users. During the debate I moved 14 amendments to the Governments Bill to try to strengthen those protections for landholders . The Minister could make no argument against five of our amendments and we will continue to pursue the other issues.
In particular we will continue to propose that a new statutory authority be appointed by the Parliament called the Gasfields Land and Water Authority to oversee the new laws.
The Labor Government has given that role to the Queensland Water Commission based in Brisbane and I will continue to argue that there should be a new authority of which local landholder and local Government leaders can be part to fulfil this critical oversight role.
The LNP has a policy for the management of the new industry and our policy will continue to grow and address new issues as the industry grows. We will continue to pursue change in the regulations when the need is identified and we are constantly seeking suggestions about what changes are necessary. I gave a solid commitment in the Parliament last week that in Government we would amend whatever legislation we need to take whatever action was required at the first verifiable case of landholders rights being lost or water pollution or land degradation occurring.
We have long recognised that there are a range of issues such as land access, water extraction and regional infrastructure that have to be dealt with properly and some of them are difficult and complex. The reality however is that dealing with those often complex issues is only made harder by the current atmosphere of anxiety and fear.
There is no doubt that the CSG industry presents rural Queenslanders with a huge challenge. The greatest challenge will be ensuring that the people who are impacted the most - rural and regional Queenslanders are able to get our fair share of the huge economic benefit that will flow to the State from this new industry.
To achieve that we have to maintain a creditable voice and a creditable position. We should never allow ourselves to be used by the serial environmental alarmists in their quest to rid the world of fossil fuels nor should we become trapped in the mind numbing world of the conspiracy theorists.
Our community leaders - including me - need to be honest and up front with people and not try to mis-represent what the real issues are for our landholders and our communities.
We need to clearly and creditably define what those issues are and then we have to find solutions to those issues or be able to prevent them from developing if no solutions are possible. Once again anxiety and fear do not help in that process. I am confident that the people of regional Queensland, the landholders and the local Government leaders especially are smart enough and resourceful enough to take on this challenge and make the lives of the next generation of regional Queenslanders better because of the opportunities it presents.

THIS week's announcement of a coal seam gas water-treatment plant at Chinchilla is one more example of how the Queensland CSG industry is overlooking the true cost to the environment and food production from unchecked resource extraction, warns state farm group AgForce.
 The QGC announcement was misleading to suggest that the water-treatment plant will benefit the local farming community, as the plant is not treating new water but removing very old water from one of Australia's most precious resources, the Great Artesian Basin.
AgForce will continue to call for a balance between agriculture and the CSG industry.

IF you are a Burdekin producer and have questioned the science behind modelling sediment run-off from grazing properties in reef areas, why not have a rainfall simulation trial set up on your property? DERM is coordinating the paddock trial as part of the Reef Plan Paddock to Reef Monitoring and Modelling process required by the Australian and Queensland governments. It is important the forecast of future sediment run-off is reliable, and is an opportunity for graziers in reef areas to help determine the true picture. The trial requires a few plots across adjoining paddocks in good and poor land condition to be selected, and run-off is measured after a rainfall simulator dumps measured loads of water. A nearby water source or track for a water truck is needed.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"CSG CANBERRA, Dec 3 AAP - The peak national advisory body on water issues has warned the coal seam gas industry could have a  significant  impact on surface and groundwater if not managed properly.
National Water Commissioner Chloe Munro on Friday called for improved management of the fledgling industry, which farmers and green groups say should be subject to a moratorium until problems are resolved.
  The commission acknowledges that the coal seam gas industry represents a significant economic opportunity for Australia,  Ms Munro said, releasing a position statement on the issue.
 However, we also recognise that if not adequately managed and regulated, the industry risks significant, long-term and adverse impacts on surface and groundwater systems. 
She said an  adaptive and precautionary management approach  was needed.
The commissioner said the main risks included: the large volumes of water being extracted; the depressurisation of coal seam aquifers; and the disposal of large volumes of treated wastewater.
She said the commission believed coal seam gas developers should operate under the same rules as other water users.
Every project should clearly spell out the environmental, social and economic risks and a plan to manage these risks, she said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WOODSIDE'S $2 billion cost blowout and six-month delay at the Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia has prompted investment bank Merrill Lynch to cut its rating on Santos.
Merrill Lynch analyst James Bullen cut his rating on Santos to neutral, from buy, because of doubts over the Adelaide company's ability to deliver a positive outcome at the planned Gladstone LNG project.
 ``With likely cost pressure due to labour and resource shortages in Australia and a number of key risks for GLNG, the risk/reward for this stock is now balanced,'' Mr Bullen said.
``The recent Woodside confession on Pluto delays and cost overruns has increased our perception of the risks associated with GLNG -- this project is equally, if not more, challenging.''
Mr Bullen said he did not doubt Santos would hit its target of a final investment decision on the first train this year, but there were questions over its ability to shore up enough gas and customers for a second train.
BG Group has already given investment approval for the two-train, $15bn-plus Queensland Curtis LNG plant, where it is aiming for 2014 first production.
Santos plans to approve one train this year, and a second within 12 months, when more gas reserves and customers are secured. Mr Bullen puts the cost of the first train at $11bn and the second at $9bn.
Another factor that will weigh on the stock is the potential for a $1bn equity raising.
Merrill Lynch said this would not be needed for the first train and should be delayed until there was more certainty over the second train.
Mr Bullen said the widely expected approval of GLNG was not likely to provide a rerating of the stock because of the thin economics of the first train and lack of certainty around a second.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The search for coal seam gas (CSG) has turned to the Wide Bay-Burnett region of south-east Queensland, with Blue Energy set to begin exploration in the Maryborough Basin.

 Two other permits are awaiting State Government approval to explore in nearby areas.
Brisbane-based company Blue Energy will farm into the permit areas and will be responsible for the exploration.
Managing director John Phillips says the company has recently held talks with three native title holders in Hervey Bay, and it is not the first drilling in the area.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,4,"Don't compare us with dodgy US operators, expert says
A GAS drilling expert has slammed reports comparing coal seam gas exploration in Australia with the environmental nightmare now plaguing communities in the United States.
 Adrian Nygaard, owner-operator of Lismore-based international company Outlaw Drilling Consultants, weighed into the debate after reading reviews of Gasland â€“ the Sundance Film Festival award-winning documentary chronicling the environmental fallout from the poorly regulated US industry.
â€œIt is simply not an appropriate representat-ion of coal seam gas drilling in Australia,â€? Mr Nyg-aard said.
â€œIf anything, we need to hold more forums and educate the public better.
â€œHere, the industry is in its infancy and is highly regulated, but in the US dodgy operators have had carte blanche.
â€œI was working over the border in Alberta, Canada, where there are similar gas deposits to here and the industry is well regulated â€“ and we were just shaking our heads.
â€œThey were doing all sorts of crazy stuff with multi-lateral and horizontal drilling.
â€œSome fields had thousands of wells in a single area, which we would never do here â€“ that's just greedy.â€?
Mr Nygaard said he had no financial interest in local gas operations, but felt passionately about his trade and felt he should speak out.
He also praised Metgasco, the gas exploration company managing two local deposits.
â€œThey are a reputable little company, transparent and accessible, just the kind of company we want here,â€? he said.
Metgasco's general manager recently told The Northern Star his company would never use the chemicals associated with US groundwater contamination in their projects based here.
Both the Greens and the NSW Farmers Association have called for a moratorium on gas drilling until the process is proven to be safe.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"PROPERTY prices have spiked in the boom town of Gladstone, defying the gloom in Queensland's property market and delivering the first real return to the community from the massive investments in coal-seam gas.
Undeveloped blocks of land are being snapped up by interstate investors, and contractor companies are booking out whole floors of hotels for months at a time to cope with the expected influx of thousands of workers to the city.
 Developer Citimark sold 10 blocks of its Emmadale Gardens estate in the first 48 hours after the announcement on October 31 that global energy giant BG Group would go ahead with its $US15 billion ($15.3bn) Curtis LNG project.
BG Group was the first of four anticipated multi-billion-dollar projects to announce funding for plans to extract gas from central Queensland's Surat Basin, before converting it to liquefied natural gas on Gladstone's Curtis Island.
The town is riding a boom, with $30 bn to $40 bn in anticipated investment pouring into the new industry.
Figures from RP Data showed an increase in Gladstone property prices of 2.7 per cent for houses and 8.5 per cent for units in the 12 months to October, but Citimark's Geoff McWilliam said sales had soared since the BG announcement. He said they had sold 20 blocks in the past month, compared with between three and five blocks a month in 2008 and last year.
``Prices have gone up between $20,000 and $30,000 since the announcement,'' he said.
Remax Gladstone director Jeff Williams said his business had doubled its property sales from 20 to 40 last month.
``The place has gone nuts,'' Mr Williams said, estimating property prices had risen up to 10 per cent in the past 30 days.
Gladstone's population is projected to increase by up to 2500 a year to 114,530 in 2031 -- almost double its 2009 population of 59,644, and a far cry from the fishing village of 50 years ago, before it was developed into a purpose-built hub for heavy industry.
As the coal-seam gas industry gears up, a workforce of 12,000 is expected to arrive to build the 450km pipeline from the Surat Basin to Gladstone, including a work camp of 2500 on Curtis Island.
Another 2500 workers will be engaged on a fly-in, fly-out basis.
Gladstone Industry Leadership Group chief executive Kurt Heidecker said the rental market was as ``tight as a drum at the moment''.
Half the 27 rooms at Gladstone's Queens Hotel have already been reserved for the first six months of next year by a company that is related to the giant BG project.
Hotel general manager Eddie Whiteside, who moved his young family to Gladstone five months ago to capitalise on the boom, said the deal could be extended for the next five years.
``In the hospitality industry we're going to benefit almost more than anyone,'' Mr Whiteside said.
``A lot of people are going to fly in and fly out, but they've still got to eat and drink and put their head on a pillow.
``It's great for our business, in that respect.''
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told a business lunch this week the emerging coal-seam gas to LNG industry was a ``once-in-a-generation opportunity''.
And the locals are optimistic about the region's ability to handle the growth.
``We would rather deal with the pressures and demands of growth than the challenges and problems of decline,'' said Gladstone Area Promotion and Development chief executive Glenn Churchill.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"WASHINGTON: Nigeria's anti-graft agency will file charges against former US vice-president Dick Cheney over a bribery scandal connected to the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant.
A spokesman for the agency confirmed plans to file charges as early as next week.
 He would not give details on the charges, except to say ``they are not unconnected to his role as the chief executive of Halliburton''.
A lawyer for Mr Cheney dismissed the claims yesterday as ``entirely baseless''.
``Any suggestion of misconduct on his part, made now, years later, is entirely baseless,'' the lawyer said.
``The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated (the joint venture at the core of the allegations) extensively and found no suggestion of any impropriety by Dick Cheney in his role of CEO of Halliburton.''
A prosecutor said joint charges would be filed against Mr Cheney at the country's high court, along with the former and current leadership of the energy giant and other officials from companies in a consortium involved in the LNG plant.
Mr Cheney would face conspiracy charges and a Nigerian judge would be asked to issue an arrest warrant for him that would be transmitted to Interpol, prosecutor Godwin Obla said.
The case involves an alleged $US182 million cash-for-contract scandal during the 10 years to 2005 over construction of the LNG plant in southern Nigeria.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE Federal Government was forced to water down its environmental conditions on a $15 billion coal seam gas project for Queensland after the company threatened to walk away.
Evidence of the threat came as the Government's own National Water Commission raised fears of long-term impacts from the multiple projects planned for the Surat Basin.
 A letter dated October 16 from Queensland Gas chief executive Catherine Tanna to Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke said the conditions placed on the company's plans were too severe.
``We have indicated to your officers that we have significant concerns with the proposed conditions relating to coal seam gas water management, offsets and the timing of various approvals,'' Ms Tanna said.
``In their proposed form, these matters present sufficient difficulty to prevent my recommending the project to the BG Group board for a final investment decision.''
Two weeks after the letter, the BG board approved the project, on which the Federal Government had placed 300 environmental conditions.
The company confirmed the Government changed its mind on some water issues after officials were shown how they had misinterpreted the plan.
Friends of the Earth activist Drew Hutton doubted all the conditions would be enforced.
``Queensland has a long history of non-enforcement of environmental regulation with regard to the mining industry which, basically, regulates itself,'' he said. ``This industry is too big and too powerful to be effectively regulated.''
Documents tabled in Federal Parliament last week show that at least one of the three projects approved had raised its own concerns about shallow groundwater contamination from salt ponds and chemical and fuel storage sites associated with processing plants.
There have also been warnings that underground acquifers would be so depleted by the projects that it could take centuries to replenish them.
The National Water Commission estimates the CSG industry would extract about 7500 gigalitres of water during the next 25 years - six times the capacity of Wivenhoe Dam.
``If not adequately managed and regulated, it risks having significant, long-term and adverse impacts on adjacent surface and groundwater systems,'' the NWC said.
On the BG approval, Mr Bourke said all proponents were given a chance to comment on the proposed decision before the final ruling is made.
``It is common practice for changes to be made to proposed conditions, in response to such comments,  he said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"RESOURCES
THE federal government's chief water adviser says the booming coal seam gas industry could inflict a  significant, long-term and adverse  toll on the nation's water supplies if it is not properly regulated.
 Amid growing tension between farmers and the rapidly expanding industry, the National Water Commission yesterday conceded the full effects of the sector were not well understood.
The gas extraction process - which involves removing massive amounts of water from underground aquifers - could hurt other water users, such as farmers, and damage water quality in river systems, it said.
Until these side effects were fully understood, it said gas companies, should be prepared to foot the bill for any fallout.
The industry is planning to spend more than $60 billion in Queensland, creating 18,000 jobs.
 The Commission acknowledges that the coal seam gas industry represents a significant economic opportunity for Australia,  the National Water Commissioner, Chloe Munro, said.
 However, we also recognise that if not adequately managed and regulated, the industry risks significant, long-term and adverse impacts on surface and groundwater systems. 
Despite growing concerns over the impact of coal seam gas on the environment, the Commission said there had been  little progress  in integrating the sector with broader water planning processes.
The industry body said it was already aware of the Commission's concerns, highlighted by the lengthy approval processes required for liquefied natural gas projects.
 The National Water Commission appears to have been asleep at the wheel,  the chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, Belinda Robinson, said.
 The industry knows these are important matters and so, too, do the state and federal governments that have specifically addressed them with the 1500 conditions attached to recent environmental approvals, and with regulations for the industry's ongoing operations. 
The biggest Australian players in the industry are Santos and Origin Energy, both of whom are working on projects to convert the gas to LNG for export from southern Queensland.
The NSW hopefuls Eastern Star and Metgasco have ambitions of one day exporting from Newcastle, but they are about 10 years behind their counterparts to the north. If all the planned projects went ahead, the Commission said it would extract 7500 gigalitres of water from underground, or 300 gigalitres a year.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Coal seam gas is emerging as a vibrant industry creating thousands of skilled jobs and a major new supply of energy.
But the National Water Commission, charged with protecting Australia's water supply, has warned the environmental affects of drilling into coal deposits to release gas deep underground were unclear and could be catastrophic.
 In a policy document published Friday, the commission said energy companies should be fully liable for any damage to the environment they cause. They could be required to lodge bonds to cover the cost of damage to water supplies over a century.
In its document the commission stated little was known about the likely effects on the underground water supplies of the Great Artesian Basin and the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin.
Federal Environment and Water Minister Tony Burke gave conditional approval to $35 billion in coal seam gas projects by Santos and the BG Group in Queensland several weeks ago.
The commission reported that coal seam gas extraction may cause land subsidence over large areas, affecting rivers, ecosystems and farmlands and waste water could  have significant impacts on water quality, and river and wetland health .
Coal seam gas wells use hydraulic fracturing to extract water from coal seams, altering the pressure and freeing the gas to flow to the surface.
National Water Commissioner Chloe Munro said making companies post environment bonds would be similar to arrangements for land rehabilitation after mines closed.
She acknowledged that significant economic benefits could come from coal seam gas but said a  precautionary approach  must be taken because of the potentially adverse impacts.
 A precautionary approach means, if there is insufficient information about the potential impacts you would require that information to be brought forward before development could take place and you have a system where there's clarity about the monitoring of impacts,  she said.
In its report the commission stated that the expanding industry was projected to use about 7500 gigalitres of water over the next 25 years, or 300 gigalitres per year, more than half of the current annual water use of 540 gigalitres from the Great Artesian Basin.
Coal seam gas was becoming an important industry in Queensland, where some 40,000 wells were expected to be drilled by 2030.
Ms Munro said it was of concern that under current rules the mining companies were not required to have a licence to use this water, unlike farmers and other water users.
Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association chief executive Belinda Robinson said the National Water Commission appeared to have been  asleep at the wheel .
 The industry knows these are important matters and so too do the state and federal governments that have specifically addressed them with the 1500 conditions attached to recent environmental approvals, and with their regulation of the industry's operations,  she said.
Federal conditions included allowing the minister to require financial assurance that a company had the capacity to respond to environmental damage.
The Queensland government imposed  make-good  conditions, outlining what companies must do in certain circumstances, for instance if water pressure dropped below a threshold.
Greens leader Bob Brown said the commission's statement should prompt the federal government to reverse its approval for the two Queensland projects.
But Mr Burke said he'd taken a precautionary approach by imposing conditions on the projects.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"PNG By Nicole Stevens
SYDNEY, Dec 6 AAP - Papua New Guinea (PNG) must accelerate the development of its natural gas projects and lock in customers or risk competition from overseas producers and unconventional coal seam and shale gas projects, an oil and gas expert says.
 Independent researcher and the chairman of FACTS Global Energy, Dr Fereidun Fesharaki, made the comments at the 11th PNG Mining and Petroleum Investment Conference in Sydney on Monday.
The three-day conference has so far focused on the US$15 billion PNG LNG (liquid natural gas) project under development by ExxonMobil in PNG's Southern Highlands.
The joint venture project with Santos, Oil Search Ltd and the PNG government is on track to deliver its first shipment of LNG in 2014.
Dr Fesharaki says PNG must act quickly to secure Asian markets for that and other LNG developments, or face competition from the cheaper Qatar LNG currently being sold into the US market.
 You have to be aware that this threat is there, so you have to act to shore up your customers,  Dr Fesharaki said.
 It is not possible to compete with Qatari LNG on economics. The only way to compete is to tie up the market. 
Dr Fesharaki said LNG production in Qatar cost about a quarter of that in PNG.
The Australian government has provided concessional loans of US$500 million to support development of the PNG LNG project, which is viewed as critical to the social and economic development of PNG.
PNG Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare said in his opening address to the conference that Australian companies had already won contracts worth twice as much as the finance provided by the Australian government.
 My government is anticipating that LNG revenues will propel the economy to new heights and significantly improve our social indicators, which for too long have remained stagnant,  Mr Somare said.
PNG is expecting growth of 7.1 per cent in 2010 and eight per cent in 2011, the Prime Minister said.
But exporting gas from the remote Southern Highlands and Western Province of PNG is not without its challenges, according to ExxonMobil upstream project mananger for the PNG LNG project Decie Autin.
Ms Autin said a 700km pipeline, including 450km of sub-sea pipeline, would be required to transport the gas to an LNG facility near Port Moresby for shipment.
Ms Autin said the pipeline must also traverse low lying topography, deep gorges and steep terrain that was subject to landslides and significant environmental areas, making it a complex undertaking.
An export terminal would operate 24 hours a day at the LNG processing site near Port Moresby, loading an LNG tanker for export every two to three days, she said.
Prime Minister Somare said he hopes to witness the reopening of the Bougainville Copper Mine, closed 20 years ago amidst secessionist violence.
 PNG is also in the throes of becoming a major world supplier of copper,  he said.
The Panguna mine at Bougainville is one of the world's largest copper and gold mines.
 Our darkest hour came with the Bougainville conflict,  Mr Somare said.
 It was a setback from which Bougainville and the nation has not fully recovered. Work is well underway to restore the damage of those years. 
Mr Somare said the government would continue to focus on providing a stable political environment and transparent mining regime to encourage futher development.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"ELEANOR HALL: There may be a lot of water around in eastern Australia, but it remains a precious resource and the federal independent MP Tony Windsor is planning to introduce a new regulatory regime to protect the water courses in the Murray-Darling Basin.
Mr Windsor says he is worried that coal seam gas projects in Queensland and New South Wales are being given the go-ahead before governments have assessed their impact on surface and groundwater systems. But the Opposition says there is a constitutional problem with Mr Windsor's demands.
 In Canberra, Alexandra Kirk reports.
ALEXANDRA KIRK: Exploiting Australia's vast coal seam gas resource is going full steam ahead. Queensland has 95 per cent of the reserves, the rest are in New South Wales, with high levels of exploration expected to add to known resources.
TONY WINDSOR: We don't allow mining activities in national parks for various reasons and there are certain land areas in the Murray-Darling system where we probably shouldn't even allow exploration to occur.
ALEXANDRA KIRK: Federal independent MP Tony Windsor's sounding an alarm, worried about the effect of mining coal seam gas on above and underground water systems.
TONY WINDSOR: Well, we've got to make sure that some of the extractive activity approvals that are still state based don't intercept ground water and surface water systems and have an adverse impact on the Murray-Darling system itself.
So there really does need to be some sort of risk assessment, a bio-regional assessment process before exploration activities or extractive activities occur on certain sensitive lands.
ALEXANDRA KIRK: Tony Windsor says the assessment needs to be done by the Commonwealth, preferably via existing federal legislation administered by the Minister for the Environment and Water, Tony Burke.
Mr Windsor's pushing for a new regulatory regime to cover all mining activities in the Murray-Darling Basin, but it's the boom in coal seam gas projects that's prompted his call.
TONY WINDSOR: Well coal seam gas involves drilling a lot of very deep holes and extracting gas, various pressurised systems using water itself but the risk of mixing various aquifers through that drilling process and extraction process is there in certain areas where saline aquifers could be mixed with freshwater aquifers. There is a whole range of adverse impacts that could occur.
I'm not suggesting that we actually stop these activities. I think we've just got to get a risk profile in certain geographic areas where there might be a greater risk than in other areas.
ALEXANDRA KIRK: He wants the risk assessment done before exploration takes place so if there's a high risk mining activity will damage the workings of the water systems then neither mining nor exploration be allowed.
TONY WINDSOR: Maybe that could be part of the mining tax process for instance. That a certain amount of money be set aside to do these risk assessments in these sensitive areas so that the mining companies know where they can and can't apply to mine and/or to explore and they're not wasting money then in terms of being granted exploration licences at a state level and then having those licences knocked back through the Commonwealth level.
ALEXANDRA KIRK: The Minister Tony Burke, who just weeks ago approved billions of dollars worth of projects in Queensland, hasn't responded to The World Today's requests for comment.
The Opposition's resources spokesman, Ian Macfarlane, says the constitution would need to be changed to accommodate Mr Windsor's plan.
IAN MACFARLANE: We'd need to see what it was that Tony brought forward. Certainly what we've seen in this regard from Tony Windsor in the past is not practical and in the words of the Australian Government's solicitor were beyond the constitutional reach of the Commonwealth.
We had a long discussion with Tony a year ago about this issue and the bottom line is that issues relating to water primarily fall within the state government purview under the constitution and whilst both Martin Ferguson and Penny Wong along with myself tried to cover some of the concerns that Tony had in specific instances, we weren't even able to do that because of the restrictions of the constitution.
I'd be happy to have a look at what Tony Windsor is proposing. I'd be happy to sit down and see how it can all be worked because in the end these two industries, the primary industry of farming and the primary industry of extracting natural resources, particularly coal seam gas, have to coexist. There is room for both and done properly the water rights of individual farmers can be protected.
ELEANOR HALL: That is the Opposition resources spokesman Ian Macfarlane ending that report from Alexandra Kirk in Canberra.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"BOW Energy says Asian buyers of liquefied natural gas have expressed interest in taking stakes of more than 30 per cent in its coal-seam gasfields, signalling greater confidence in an industry that Australia hopes will be an engine of future growth.
Bow's initial sales talks with Korean and Japanese companies had shown a strong appetite for LNG produced from coal-seam gas, but management was in no rush to sign a binding deal as it continued to examine options, chief executive John de Stefani said.
 These included taking part in a small-scale onshore LNG development at the port of Gladstone in Queensland, or selling gas to any of four multi-billion-dollar LNG export projects planned on nearby Curtis Island.
``We are finding that LNG buyers in Asia would like an investment upstream of significance -- much higher than the 5-10 per cent that we have seen in deals so far,'' Mr de Stefani said.
His comments may ease market concerns that Australia's coal-seam gas producers are struggling to line up offshore customers, particularly in North Asia, at a time when the industry is facing a glut of conventional LNG supply.
Booming US shale gas output has prompted LNG exporters in the Middle East to target Asia instead, and Australia has a raft of conventional LNG projects in the pipeline, including the Chevron-led Wheatstone project and $43 billion Gorgon project.
Further complicating matters is that technology to liquefy coal-seam gas -- trapped stores of methane in coal seams hundreds of metres below the earth's surface -- for export is untried.
LNG made from coal-seam gas has a slightly lower calorific content than LNG made from natural gas, meaning it produces less energy when burnt. While this calorific value can be lifted by spiking with products such as ethane and butane, many LNG buyers have signalled that they prefer imports of conventional supplies.
However, the sector got a lift on October 31 when BG Group formally decided to go ahead with its $15bn project on Curtis Island, which from 2014 should start annual exports of up to 9.5 million tonnes of LNG made from coal-seam gas to customers in Chile, China, Japan and Singapore.
Separately, Korea Gas said last month that it was seeking to acquire a 15 per cent stake in the Santos-led LNG venture at Gladstone that already counts France's Total and Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional as shareholders.
Shares in Bow hit a high of $1.57 in September 2009, benefiting from over $20bn flowing into the industry in Queensland as companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and Conoco Phillips bet on coal-seam gas as the world's next major energy play. Bow's shares have stagnated since then, closing at $1.235 on Friday and giving the company a market value of $400 million.
Bow might look at signing a non-binding offtake agreement, but the focus was on ensuring coal-seam gas from its tenements in Queensland could be produced commercially, and securing approvals for a 257km pipeline from a hub near the town of Blackwater to Gladstone, Mr de Stefani said.
The company is drilling two sets of four wells in its Comet block surrounding Blackwater and plans to carry out a similar program in its Norwich Park acreage to the north.
Hopefully, the drilling results would enable Bow to upgrade its reserves to a target of 4130 petajoules of proven, probable and possible coal-seam gas reserves by the end of the year, up from 2574 petajoules now, Mr de Stefani said.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"COMPANIES seeking to exploit NSW's lucrative coal-seam gas reserves are likely to face a new federal regulatory barrier as independent Tony Windsor prepares to use his balance of power position to require region-wide water assessments before any new mining proceeds.
Mr Windsor said he wanted to force miners to conduct  bioregional assessments  of the cumulative impact of their controversial projects on surface and groundwater, preferably before exploration licences were issued but if necessary before mining proceeded.
 He said he would implement the plan either by amending the Water Act - which covers the Murray Darling Basin region - or by using the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act, which would mean the new rules applied nationally.
 I want the federal government to be involved in the assessment process right at the outset, so if a region is assessed as being of high risk, the miners don't even bother going there,  Mr Windsor said.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2010,4,"Frack is not a pleasant word. Nor a popular one. It has obvious negative connotations. Even the spelling is contested. The industry that invented and uses the term prefers the spelling  fracc . Either way, you wouldn't want to be fracked, or fracced.
This could change. Money always changes things. Hydraulic fracturing - fracking (Herald style), or fraccing (used by the natural gas industry) - represents a potential goldmine for Australia. It is the key to developing energy resources potentially much bigger than the natural gas deposits off Western Australia that have been part of the resources export boom that protected Australia from the global recession and is beginning to change the entire economy.
 The natural gas fields off the coast of Western Australia have enough energy to sustain all of Australia's baseload needs for hundreds of years, and slash greenhouse emissions in the process, yet these reserves are exceeded by what lies below much of NSW and Queensland, trapped inside enormous reserves of coal, according to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. All up, with natural gas we are sitting on another Saudi Arabia.
But we are also being told that much of this is destructive energy, that the process of hydraulic fracturing, which is how coal seam gas is extracted from coal beds, can only be achieved by an unsustainable level of water depletion, and an unacceptable risk to ground water tables.
That is why the short word used for hydraulic fracturing is essentially becoming synonymous with environmental vandalism. Now exploratory drilling for coal seam gas is about to begin within Sydney itself, in St Peters, because Sydney is sitting on the sort of coal beds that can yield commercial coal seam gas.
You would certainly believe this was bad if you had seen the new film Gasland, a horror movie in documentary form. You would also hate fracking if you believed the Greens. Having killed off the Rudd government's proposed emissions trading scheme, the Greens are now busy clogging the development of the technology which represents transformative change in reducing greenhouse emissions - natural gas, nuclear power, and now coal seam gas, the energy source extracted by fracking.
The chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, Belinda Robinson, says:  The Greens have described climate change as 'the greatest threat to our world in human history', yet their political response is to oppose, at every turn, the development of Australia's gas industry.  In contrast to this view, every possible argument to the development of coal seam gas in Australia can be found in Gasland, an American documentary now showing in some Australian theatres and on Qantas long-haul flights.
I enjoyed Gasland. How can one not be moved by claims that a relatively new technology, hydraulic fracturing, poses an innate threat to ground water supplies wherever it is used? The film features some wild images, such as when Mike Markham turns on the kitchen tap in his home in Colorado, puts a lit lighter to the flowing water, and the water bursts into flame. This, we are told, is what fracking does to your water supply. It makes you sick. It makes your home dangerous.
Gasland also features stark images of entire communities that have become sick after their water supply was contaminated by natural gas. It features despoiled landscapes. It also features a brace of scientists.
The scientists are important because the maker of Gasland, Josh Fox, is not a scientist. He is a good filmmaker, but he is also a polemicist, intent on revealing what he believes is a vast conspiracy of silence.
He also may have trouble with the truth. Large factual holes can be found in Gasland. Yes, Markham's kitchen water caught on fire, but the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission had already conducted a study of his property before Gasland was made and concluded that his water was contaminated by natural gas - it's impossible to miss - but the gas was naturally occurring, not the result of nearby coal seam gas mining. The film simply ignores this, as it does with several other similar findings in properties used as other examples.
This is the inconvenient truth that Gasland skirts. If you live above coal seam beds, your wells have a chance of natural contamination. It doesn't require coal seam gas mining for this to happen, but Gasland blames mining every time. It prefers the dramatic to the accurate, such as this claim:  [The process] blasts a mix of water and chemicals 8000 feet (2438 metres) into the ground. The fracking itself is like a mini-earthquake ... in order to frack, you need fracking fluid, a mix of over 596 chemicals. 
But nearly all the fluids used are a mixture of water and sand, along with a handful of chemicals - not 596 - most of which can also be found in household items, such as emulsifiers in ice cream. Numerous other bald claims made in Gasland are simply untrue. I downloaded eight pages of scientific material debunking the film.
No energy extraction process is without problems. But the idea that fracking is run by secretive cowboys, largely beyond the bounds of environmental oversight, is wrong on every count. Gasland, in other words, is like the Greens: it spouts far more hot air than strictly necessary.

COMPANIES seeking to exploit the lucrative NSW coal seam gas reserves are likely to face a new federal regulatory barrier as the independent MP Tony Windsor prepares to use his balance-of-power position to require region-wide water assessments before new mining proceeds.
 Mr Windsor told the Herald he wanted to force miners to conduct  bio-regional assessments  of the cumulative impact of their controversial projects on surface and groundwater, preferably before exploration licences were issued, but if necessary before mining proceeded.
He said he would implement the plan either by amending the Water Act, which covers the Murray-Darling Basin region, or the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act, which would mean the new rules applied nationwide.
 I want the federal government to be involved in the assessment process right at the outset, so if a region is assessed as being of high risk, the miners don't even bother going there,  Mr Windsor said.  The process would also allow us to assess the cumulative effects of multiple mines in a region, rather than each being assessed separately. 
When he proposed a similar amendment to the Water Act in 2008 Labor opposed it, as did the Coalition after initially offering support.
But the federal MP for New England now wields extra clout as one of the three MPs who delivered government to Labor and as chairman of the parliamentary committee into the politically sensitive Murray-Darling Basin plan, which begins hearings this month.
The issue of coal seam gas mines on the rich NSW Liverpool Plains farmland has also been a fraught issue for Mr Windsor's former colleagues and now fierce rivals, the National Party.
Two of the scores of companies with licences to explore for coal seam gas in NSW are chaired by former National Party leaders: Aston Resources by Mark Vaile and Eastern Star Gas by John Anderson.
Farmers and environmental groups have called for a mining moratorium until fears about groundwater contamination are resolved.
On Friday the national water commissioner, Chloe Munro, said the coal seam gas industry needed to be better managed because it could have a  significant  impact on surface and groundwater.  The commission acknowledges that the coal seam gas industry represents a significant economic opportunity for Australia,  she said, releasing a position statement on it.
 However, we also recognise that if not adequately managed and regulated, the industry risks significant, long-term and adverse impacts on surface and groundwater systems. 
She said the commission believed coal seam gas developers should operate under the same rules as other water users.
Last month the Water Minister, Tony Burke, approved $35 billion worth of coal seam gas projects in Queensland, but documents released later showed his department had  significant concerns  about it and said the gas extraction could have implications for the Murray-Darling Basin.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"The Fraser Coast Regional Council in south-east Queensland says it will support a plan to extract coal seam gas (CSG) in the region if the proposal is environmentally responsible.
Brisbane Company Blue Energy intends to begin exploring the Maryborough Basin, about 20 kilometres south west of Burrum Heads, mid-next year.
 Council economic development spokesman Gerard O'Connell says the project could boost the local economy.
 We're always recognising the fact that we need to do things environmentally, and have a great regard for the environment,  he said.
 With the necessary permits that will be granted by the State Government, we'd be happy to support this type of investment because it does bring jobs to our region. 
He says the CSG industry could help reduce unemployment.
 I think any industry that's environmentally responsible, any industry that wants to make an investment into our region and most importantly, provides jobs for our people and brings back the unemployment figure and gives us greater prosperity, is somebody we should be certainly talking to,  he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"EXXONMOBIL'S liquefied natural gas joint venture in Papua New Guinea, worth $US15 billion ($15.1bn), may fast-track an expansion to secure buyers, project partner Oil Search said yesterday.
The desire to move fast comes as rival gas export projects in Australia and PNG scramble for Asian customers in a well-supplied market that could be made tighter if Qatar decides to ship more gas to Asia than to Europe and the US.
 ``There's a window of opportunity in the market and strong competition, and if you miss that window you might be sitting in a queue for a while,'' Oil Search chief executive Peter Botten said.
The first phase of PNG LNG, capable of producing 6.6 million tonnes a year from two production units, is on track for completion in the first quarter of 2014, the PNG Minister for Treasury and Finance Peter O'Neill told a conference in Sydney.
ExxonMobil representatives at the conference declined to be interviewed, but Oil Search's Mr Botten said the project's expansion timetable ``is being very actively worked on as we speak''.
Exploration drilling in the Hides and P'nyang prospects to find gas to feed a bigger terminal is planned to start from mid-next year, stretching into 2012.
``Our whole exploration and development program is subject to review, and we've made it clear publicly that we're keen to understand our resource base in all our licences as quickly as possible,'' Mr Botten said.
He believed there would be no problem getting relevant licence renewals from the PNG government to allow drilling to proceed.
Mr Botten declined to confirm recent analysts' reports that a final investment decision for a third LNG processing unit was being targeted for the end of 2012.
Fereidun Fesharaki, the chairman of global energy consultant FACTS, said LNG projects in Qatar were the world's most economical, with the lowest costs, and that a large Qatari LNG tanker could pull in about $US40m more revenue from Asian customers than from the US.
For the time being, however, the Qataris have ``got into a bit of an argument'' with Asian buyers over price. ``When will they turn the ship and bring it eastwards? That's the question,'' Mr Fesharaki said. ``If you are an exporter, you have to be aware that this shadow is there. And the sooner you get your act in order, and the sooner you tie up the customer, the better off you are.''
ExxonMobil's Decie Autin, the upstream project manager for PNG LNG, said contractors were progressing detailed engineering, procurement and execution planning in Japan and had initiated LNG site earthworks. ``Manpower will steadily increase in 2011 to allow us to load the first LNG cargo . . . in 2014,'' she said.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2010,4,"Acting Queensland opposition leader Lawrence Springborg and local MP Howard Hobbs held a community forum in Miles on Monday to address local concerns with the mining industry.
More than 100 people attended voicing various concerns about coal seam gas mining and coal mining in the region.
 Community concerns included issues with water, mining on prime farming land, compensation to farmers for mining, downgrading of farming land, seperation distances and access to land by mining companies.
Mr Springborg began the forum by laying out the LNP's position and policies regarding the mining industry.
â€œWhat we are trying to do is to work within an environment where we are making sure there are appropriate regulations and oversights that landholder issues are being properly understood and properly protected by the governments regulatory environment,â€? he said.
Mr Springborg said there would be landowners who had rather harmonious and satisfactory engagements with the CSG companies and many who had not.
The acting opposition leader also spoke on water.
â€œWe want the CSG companies to clearly demonstrate to us in hypothetical modelling situations ... the likely impact on underground water.â€?
Mr Springborg also touched on issues relating to prime freehold land and utility corridors used by mining companies.
â€œOur preference is for CSG companies to use existing State road and State land corridors including easement areas,â€? he said.
â€œThe primacy of freehold land and individual property rights is something that leads to people having confidence.â€?
Forum members also had major concerns about separation distances between coal seam gas infrastructure and housing.
â€œI don't believe 200 metres is an appropriate seperation distance,â€? Mr Springborg said.
â€œIt should be 500 metres unless there is absolute consent by the home owner about having it closer.â€?
Wandoan land owner Dale Stiller raised concerns related to downgrading of land, while Phillip Hughes brought up issues relating to compensation and access to land. While a number of people at the forum called for Mr Springborg to lobby for a moratorium on gas mining until adequate environmental impact studies are completed.
â€œI'm not a big fan of moratoriums full stop,â€? he said.
â€œI didn't like the moratorium the government put on tree clearing; it adds more uncertainty and doesn't address the issue in the long run.â€?
Mr Springborg said at the end of the day the CSG industry has a strong place in the QLD economy but not at the expense of landholders' basic rights.
â€œWe are making sure that the regulations and environmental protections and sustainability are right and that is where the LNP is coming from,â€? he said.
Meanwhile Member of Warrego Howard Hobbs said it was important that people were able to come together to talk about these issues.
â€œAll we can do is help steer the government to put in place the right mechanisms,â€? he said.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,4,"LISMORE City Councillor David Yarnall has added his voice to the chorus calling for a moratorium on all coal seam gas mining in NSW, asking the council to back the ban.
Cr Yarnall will put a motion to Tuesday's council meeting backing the call for a moratorium by the NSW Farmers Association and Australian Greens, and urging State and Federal governments to adopt the temporary ban.
 â€œCoal seam gas mining exploration has recently been conducted in the Lismore LGA in the Keerrong Valley,â€? he wrote in support of his motion.
â€œExperience of similar mining across the Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland brings into question the process of CSG mining, and in particular the use of hydraulic fracturing.â€?
The issue has gained widespread public attention following the release of the US film Gasland and discovery of trace elements of chemicals known as BTEX found in Queensland coal gas seam mines.
Citing a Geoscience report, Cr Yarnall said he was concerned about the effect fracking has on the Great Artesian Basin, local aquifers and surface water.
â€œThe implications for farmers and urban residents if groundwater becomes contaminated are enormous,â€? he said.
â€œCurrently there is a lack of adequate data to assess the implications of the process of hydraulic fracturing of underground water. A moratorium should be implementeduntil an appropriate independent assessment of the environmental impacts of CSG mining is conducted.â€?
Any state or national moratorium would have a major impact on Metgasco, which in addition to its Kingfisher field has recently commenced drilling an appraisal well at South Casino.
Its managing director, David Johnson, has repeatedly said the company has never used BTEX chemicals associated with groundwater contamination.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"CHINA is stepping up its bid for a large slice of Australia's gas reserves, with Queensland exploration minnow Exoma to receive a $78 million investment by one of China's three energy behemoths, China National Offshore Oil Corporation.
The deal is CNOOC's first offshore investment in coal seam gas exploration and is part of a multi-trillion dollar project by China's big three state-owned energy groups to secure supplies and resources to feed its urbanising and increasingly wealthy population.
 If drilling over the next three years is successful, the result could be a $12 billion infrastructure project that links a new pipeline to an export gas terminal at Abbot Point, about 150km south of Townsville.
``We have been in talks with CNOOC for the past 13 months,'' Exoma chairman Brian Barker said in Beijing yesterday.
``This deal brings us not just expertise but access to markets.''
Exoma was keen to do this a ``bit differently from other juniors'' by securing a deal with a Chinese company at an early stage after rebuffing a number of big US energy companies, Mr Barker said.
If the project went to plan. China would provide ``a lot'' of the funding.
CNOOC, China's biggest offshore energy company, will take a 50 per cent interest in a joint venture on all five of Exoma's large central Queensland tenements, as well as an option to buy 19.9 per cent of Exoma -- which is expected to be completed after government approvals -- for a further $28m.
The assets are in Central Queensland's Galilee basin around the town of Longreach, which is believed to hold the largest untapped coal seam gas and shale gas deposit in Australia.
Other companies, including AGL, Blue Energy and ConocoPhillips are also exploring in the region.
Mr Barker said there was a gas deposit of about 100 trillion cubic feet and that about 9-10tcf would be needed for a full commercial project.
``The only thing we have to do is to find out is we can get it out commercially,'' he said. This would involved drilling 50-100 wells over the next few years.
The deal was triggered by China's desire to deliver more of its energy through clean fuel and technology, and was the latest in a spate of deals by the country's energy majors in the sector.
CNOOC has joined Petrochina -- which has inked two deals in Queensland's gas-rich coalfields -- in tapping into the race for coal seam gas, and Sinopec has said it was planning its own deals in Australia.
It is CNOOC's third Australian gas deal this year, after a wait of more than eight years since buying a 5.3 per cent interest in the North West Shelf.
In March the company agreed to spend as much as $60bn buying 3.6 million metric tons of LNG a year from BG's proposed export terminal at Gladstone over 20 years, as well as a 5 per cent interest in its assets.
It has also entered a joint venture in Australia with Altona Energy to exploit the Arckaringa coal project in South Australia.
CNOOC's Australian gas interests
* CNOOC holds a 5.3% interest in the North West Shelf gas project and a 25% interest in certain offshore exploration permits in Western Australia where the JV is conducting a significant exploration program
* 5% interest in British Gas/QGC's CSG tenements in the Surat Basin and a 10% equity interest in one of the first two LNG trains to be built by BG in Gladstone
* CNOOC has also entered into an agreement with BG - worth about $60 billion - to buy 3.6mtpa of LNG from the proposed Gladstone LNG plant
* FIRB approval to acquire a controlling interest in the South Australian Arckaringa Coal Project where coal for power and coal-to-oil technology will be developed
* $78 million to acquire joint venture rights and 19.9 per cent of Queensland coal seam gas junior Exoma

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"CHINA National Offshore Oil Corp has splashed out $50 million to boost its position in Queensland's burgeoning coal seam gas industry.
The Chinese government-owned CNOOC will buy a 50 per cent stake in Brisbane-based Exoma Energy's five exploration blocks in the Galillee Basin, southwest of Mackay.
 ``CNOOC brings in not just the expertise, not just the money to help us with this project, but critically they bring us access to the market,'' Exoma chairman Brian Barker said in Beijing yesterday, adding that the main destination of the gas was China.
``They told us that basically we don't need to worry about the market for the gas.''
CNOOC also has an option to purchase as many as 86.6 million Exoma shares at 31.5, representing a 19.9 per cent stake in the company for $27 million.
The stock last traded for 29 on Tuesday.
CNOOC's domestic rival PetroChina joined Royal Dutch Shell in acquiring Queensland CSG producer Arrow Energy for $3.5 billion earlier this year.
International and Australian energy companies expect to spend more than $50 billion on projects converting CSG into liquefied natural gas for export from Gladstone.
In March this year CNOOC signed a $60 billion deal with the UK's BG Group to take 3.6 million tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years from its proposed Queensland Curtis LNG project. It also agreed to buy 5 per cent of BG's Queensland CSG reserves and a small stake in the first phase of the QCLNG project.
The latest deal with Exomo comes after 13 months of negotiations and is subject to approval from both the Chinese and Australian governments.
Mr Barker said the gas from Exoma's Galilee fields may go to BG's QCLNG plant initially.
In the long term, CNOOC and Exoma may build a new LNG project involving the development of fields and pipelines that would cost as much as $20 billion, he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Papua New Guinea is determined to obtain maximum benefit from its mining assets, write Perry Williams and Angela Macdonald-Smith.
Papua New Guinea is hopeful a second wave of energy and mining projects will drive the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund as the government looks to broaden revenues beyond ExxonMobil's $US15 billion PNG liquefied natural gas project.
 Forecast growth in PNG's economy of 8 per cent in 2011 and up to 8.5 per cent in the medium term has sparked PNG's government into modernising its resources regulation and investment framework.
Last month PNG revealed plans to create its first sovereign wealth fund to channel future revenues from the country's resources sector into a series of separately administered funds.
The Department of Petroleum and Energy will also undergo reform, including the establishment of a Petroleum Resources Authority, while a National Petroleum Company of Papua New Guinea will be created next year.
PNG has also vowed to toughen its  use it or lose it  principles on petroleum and mining licences in a bid to fast-track energy and mining developments.
Energy Minister William Duma told The Australian Financial Review the country has a  short window  to restructure key resource bodies and capitalise on future project earnings.
 We realise our time is now but we cannot plough on as we have done,  said Mr Duma.  We have to make sure PNG can compete with every other jurisdiction in the world for investment dollars. 
Several companies heavily involved in the country's next wave of projects recently received backing from billionaire hedge fund investor George Soros.
The Hungarian-American financier doubled his stake in PNG focused energy explorer InterOil last month, becoming its third-largest investor with a $300 million shareholding.
Mr Soros also appears interested in PNG's smaller players.
Yesterday oil and gas explorer New Guinea Energy raised $20.2 million through a placement to another Soros investment vehicle, Quantum Partners, with funds going towards ongoing exploration.
InterOil plans to build an 8 million tonne a year LNG plant to compete with ExxonMobil's PNG LNG project, already under construction, which will have a first phase annual capacity of 6.3 million tonnes.
Mr Duma recently extended InterOil's licence to allow them time to acquire partners and funding for their project.
Other energy and mining projects currently in the development phase include Highlands Pacific's Ramu nickel venture, due to start production next year, and Marengo Mining's $US1 billion-plus Yandera copper and molybdenum project, scheduled to start in 2013 or 2014. Marengo yesterday raised $C63.25 million ($63.70 million) in new equity that will enable it to complete a definitive feasibility study on the project.
In the next few years PNG could feasibly be building three world-scale mining operations including Yandera, the massive Frieda River project by Xstrata and Highlands Pacific, estimated to cost $US5.3 billion.
PNG Prime Minister Michael Somare has also launched a fresh push to reopen the Bougainville copper mine at a cost of about $US4 billion after it closed 20 years ago. The government says it is aware of the need to  tread carefully  in the coming years as it prepares to handle a surge in state revenues from a string of new resource projects.
 We must be careful we don't overheat the domestic economy and carefully manage it so there are no adverse effects on the non-mineral sectors of the economy as well,  PNG treasury secretary Simon Tosali told an industry conference in Sydney yesterday.
While PNG has operated an onshore Mineral Resource Stabilisation Fund since 1974 along with various trust accounts, the government argues the size of forthcoming LNG revenues has macroeconomic implications that require careful management.
A joint treasury and Bank of PNG working group has recommended for all LNG revenue and investment earnings to be channelled through a single pool of funds. The wealth fund will be overseen by an independent board with investment potentially to be undertaken by an offshore investment manager.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"IT was a four-hour grilling deputy State Opposition leader Lawrence Spring-borg won't soon forget.
Already disappointed at the Bligh Government's rapid approval of coal seam gas (CSG) developments across Queensland, landholder frustration turn-ed to the LNP on Monday, as more than 150 farmers gathered for a question-and- answer session with Mr Springborg at Miles.
 The mood among the audience was tense as Mr Springborg was forced to apologise to bush voters for the LNP's failure to clearly deliver its CSG policy to affected landholders.
He promised the party would be more vocal on the issue in coming months.
But what landholders really wanted to know was if an LNP government would do what the current government will not | would the LNP better control the 'bolting horse' that has become the ever-expanding CSG industry?
 We can't put the horse back into the stable, but we can steer it around the paddock a little bit,  Mr Springborg told landholders.
 This industry will be allowed to develop where its impacts are minimal and can be managed, and in other areas, where it can't do that, it won't develop. 
Reflecting perhaps the two leading schools of thought over how to best handle the CSG mining boom, some landholders repeated calls for a moratorium on all development, while others called for improved compensation measures.
Mr Springborg said the LNP did not support a moratorium but firmly fav-oured increasing landholder negotiation rights and the level of compensation paid.
 You can't take away someone's development approval that they've been given previously,  he said.
 It's very difficult to change what's come before us other than to impose regulation on how they operate. 
He said a moratorium would simply stall a decision on the industry's future and give more years of uncertainty to landholders, leading to multiple calls from the gathered landholders for the LNP to rethink this policy.
On a lighter note, Property Rights Australia vice-chairman Lee McNichol brought the house down with his version of the 'personal moratorium'.
 I am in favour of a moratorium and that's why I'm locking my gate,  he said to loud applause.
 There are others locking their gates, too. We're having our own little moratorium party and you're (Lawrence Springborg) invited. 
Several of the landholders com-plained throughout the afternoon that they were receiving a one-off payment of only $1500 from the miners for each well drilled on their property.
This prompted LNP Member for Warrego Howard Hobbs to label the figure  grossly inadequate  and suggest a fairer figure would be $10,000 for each well dug, every year the company drilled.
It was a call that received widespread approval from the audience.
 I think the gas companies would be happy to pay that kind of money, but at the moment they don't have to | the government isn't making them,  Mr Hobbs said.
 If the compensation for farmers were fairer, I think we'd see a vast improvement in relations between landholders and the gas companies. 
Mr Springborg admitted the ability of the LNP to alter the direction of current government policy was  limited  from the Opposition benches.
However, he said if elected to govern, the party would place mining companies under tighter regulatory framework that ensured landholder rights and reduced the risk of environmental degradation.
 The regulation in Queensland is org-anic | it's an evolutionary beast. What we've got at the moment is not going to stop with an LNP government. If we have to move to provide further protection, we will do that,  he said.
 While the economic imperative is important, if you just rush for the almighty dollar, then you run the risk of bastardising the process and setting up future generations for the wrong sort of outcomes. 
Mr Springborg admitted the LNP had  undersold  its CSG policy platform and could be doing more to address the concerns of bush voters.
 Standing here today, sometimes I feel like a government minister, but I'm a government minister without much authority other than to stand up and jump up and down,  he said.
 We're trying to use the parliamentary process as best as we can to air the concerns of people who are coming to us and get changes | and we've had some success with the help of organised groups and communities.
 The election will be sometime in the next 12 or 18 months, and if we're privileged enough to take government, then we can start to make real changes.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"APLNG MELBOURNE, Dec 10 AAP - The Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture says a comprehensive investigation has given water produced at its coal seam gas project the all clear.
The $35 billion APLNG project was put under a cloud last month after traces of contaminants including the carcinogen benzene was found in fluid samples taken from eight of its CSG exploration wells in Queensland.
 But on Friday, APLNG said a comprehensive investigation into traces of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) confirmed no significant risk to the environment or human health associated with its coal seam gas exploration activities in October.
 The investigation identified possible sources of BTEX contaminants, including small amounts of lubricants and diesel which may have been introduced inadvertently in the course of operations,  APLNG said in a statement.
 Processed mineral oil present in an additive previously used in HFS (hydraulic fracture stimulation) fluids was also identified as containing trace levels of TEX chemicals,  it said.
It said the investigation also indicated trace levels of BTEX chemicals could occur naturally under some conditions.
 Australia Pacific LNG will continue regular testing of water from its operations,  it said.
The APLNG joint venture project, a 50:50 collaboration between Origin Energy Ltd and US company ConocoPhillips, will have its plant based on Curtis Island near Gladstone in Queensland.
It is expected to begin exporting LNG in 2014.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE chances that Queensland's Galilee Basin will one day join the state's existing coal seam gas provinces in the Bowen and Surat Basin are increasing, as international buyers continue to stake claims in the area.
The Galilee is already the centre of ambitious coal production hopes, with billionaires Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer competing to get massive thermal coal operations into production.
 India's Adani group is also looking at early production of a massive 30 million tonnes of coal annually and claiming to be ahead of the local magnates in terms of planing.
The basin was not so long ago thought to be too far from the coast, let alone international markets, to be a serious producer of coal or gas, perhaps for some generations.
But Chinese giant CNOOC (the China National Offshore Oil Corporation) is the latest overseas player to put a toe in the Galilee's waters, where it has been joined many of Australia's CSG majors.
CNOOC's entry came this week through a $50 million investment in five Galilee exploration permits held by Brisbane-based Exoma Energy, which will give the Chinese group a 50 per cent participating interest in the exploration blocks.
The deal gives Exoma chairman Brian Barker and his company a destination for its gas.
``They told us that basically we don't need to worry about the market for the gas,'' he said as the deal was announced in Beijing.
Significant production from the Galilee Basin region is probably still a long way off.
But CNOOC, which is building its fourth big liquefied natural gas reception terminal in China, and a string of other international companies, are obviously looking at the Galilee long term.
WestSide Corporation, currently a small producer from the Bowen Basin but with promising exploration areas there and in the Galilee, recently announced that its Bowen Basin partner, Mitsui of Japan, would exercise a farm-in option to acquire 49 per cent interests in its two Galilee Basin exploration areas.
Major Australian energy players have been in the Galilee a lot longer than their international rivals, however.
In 2008, AGL Energy agreed to spend $37 million in coal seam gas areas there held by Galilee Energy, a subsidiary controlled by listed company Eastern Corp.
Eastern has recently mopped up the minorities in Galilee and adopted its name.
If the full $37 million is spent, AGL will own 50 per cent of Galilee Energy's exploration ground.
Origin Energy has been an even longer-term Galilee participant, having gained a significant foothold there by taking over American group Tri-Star Petroleum in 2002.
Meanwhile, another small CSG hopeful, Blue Energy, is talking to Korea Gas Corporation about a Galilee Basin farm-in.
Kogas is also expected to sign with Santos, as a significant customer, and probably equity partner, in its planned Curtis Island LNG plant at Gladstone.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"India's booming economy could well become the second engine of growth for Australian commodity exports in the next few decades, but only if it breaks free from its maze of bureaucray and scandal, writes Michael Dwyer.
The future of Australia's biggest commodities boom in a century may well lie in places like Dabhol, a one-time fishing village 300 kilometres south of the bustling Indian financial capital of Mumbai. India's third import facility for liquefied natural gas, located at Dabhol on the coast of the western state of Maharashtra, is due to receive its first LNG shipment this month amid surging demand for energy in the world's second most populous nation.
 But construction of the Dabhol facility has dragged on for years and has been the subject of numerous delays, highlighting the challenges facing India as it attempts to replicate China's economic success.
If India manages to break free from a long history of bureaucratic malaise and scandal, its booming economy could well become the second engine of growth for Australian commodity exports in the next few decades.
Yet the scandal over the way Manmohan Singh's government issued second-generation mobile phone licences in 2008 â€“ costing as much as $US40 billion in lost revenue â€“ also highlights some of the uncertainties involved in operating in the Indian market.
Prime Minister Singh's Congress Party-led government has been thrown into disarray by the phone permit scandal as India's Central Bureau of Investigation and Supreme Court look into the role of Andimuthu Raja, the former communications minister forced to resign over the scandal.
No one disputes that India has plenty of potential to become a bigger player in the global economy, with insatiable energy needs that many analysts say could see the South Asian giant rival China's influence on global commodity prices in coming decades.
 It is hardly surprising that the spotlight for commodities demand has been firmly focused on China, and India has been overlooked in this area,  says Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore.  This is set to change. 
Bajoria says India's commodity demand has reached a  tipping point  and growth is set to accelerate significantly, with the country's primary energy demand likely to soar by 50 per cent in the next five years and metals demand to jump 80 per cent.
And imports will be needed to make up for a lot of that demand, requiring a  strong supply response  from commodity exporters such as Australia during the next few years.
India has already become an increasingly important market for Australian commodity exports in the past few years as South Asia's biggest economy vies with South Korea for third position on the list of Australia's largest overseas markets.
Australia's exports to India have jumped to an average of about $1.3 billion a month from as little as $55 million two decades ago, and now account for around 8 per cent of shipments.
Australia recorded a trade surplus with India of $15.5 billion last year, second only to the trade surplus with Japan.
China accounts for about a quarter of Australian exports.
Commodity companies operating in Australia are eyeing the potential.
BG Group, which recently committed to building a new $US15 billion LNG project in Queensland, is one of the companies that's expressed interest in supplying the 5 million tonne a year Dabhol import facility.
State-owned GAIL India, the largest gas transmission company in India and a stakeholder in the finally completed Dabhol facility, hasn't yet disclosed the spot supplier of the terminal's inaugural shipment.
Linc Energy earlier this year signed a $3 billion deal with India's Adani group for the sale of its Galilee coal tenement in north-west Queensland, the largest single investment by an Indian company in Australia.
India is certainly on the Reserve Bank of Australia's radar â€“ the central bank provides a regular commentary on the performance of the Indian economy in its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy.
 As we think about the future, the story is broader than China,  RBA assistant governor Philip Lowe said in a recent speech.
 Over the years ahead, the Indian economy, which also contains more than 20 per cent of the world's population within its borders, is likely to become increasingly important to Australia. 
Australia is already India's main source of coking coal imports and is likely to be a major beneficiary of what Barclays estimates by 2030 will be a four-fold increase in demand from 2010 levels.
 As China's demand growth slows in the next decade or so, India's growth is poised to take up some of the slack,  Bajoria says.
While China's gross domestic product growth has averaged close to 10 per cent since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping first started opening up the economy in the late 1970s, India's GDP growth has noticeably picked up speed since Singh first came to office in the mid-1990s.
The International Monetary Fund is predicting neck and neck GDP growth between the two emerging giants next year, with China's economy tipped to expand 9.6 per cent and India forecast to achieve growth of 8.4 per cent.
Figures released late last month show the Indian economy expanded by 8.9 per cent in the September quarter from a year earlier, matching the pace of the previous three-month period.
 India has a good chance of lifting its trend GDP growth rate to around 9 per cent in coming years, from 8 per cent now,  says Vishnu Varathan, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.  This will happen at a time when China will shift its development away from the emphasis on state-led investment and exports, towards more domestic-demand focused areas such as services. Accordingly, growth in China will probably slow towards 8 per cent over the long run, and may be even slower. 
Given its 20-year head start, China's economic development in the past three decades is viewed by many analysts as a reasonably good template to judge what could be achieved in India.
 Like China, India too is urbanising,  the RBA's Lowe says.
 As people move to cities the demand for steel tends to rise. Not surprisingly, in China consumption of steel has more than quadrupled since 1997. Indian steel consumption has also grown, but not nearly as quickly.
 However, the experience of China and that of other countries that have urbanised hints at the potential growth in India. 
McKinsey Global Institute estimates that India will need to build the equivalent of a city the size of Chicago every year for the next two decades as its urban middle class swells to 91 million households from 21 million today.
Bajoria from Barclays Capital notes that India's contribution to global commodities demand is already significant, although it is still normally China that makes the headlines.
 Between 2000 and 2009, almost 20 per cent of the growth in global zinc consumption came from India, while for both oil and copper India's contribution to global demand growth was 12 per cent,  he says.  Without India's growth in the past two years, we estimate that growth in global demand for lead, primary energy and gas would have been negative, global oil demand would have fallen by 22 per cent more, while coal and wheat demand growth would have halved. 
But not all analysts are quite so bullish on the India growth story.
Robert Prior-Wandesforde, the Singapore-based head of India and South-East Asia economics at Credit Suisse, says there are significant differences between India and China that make it difficult to compare the role of the two emerging economies in terms of driving global commodities demand.
 The key difference between the two is that India is not as industry-based as China,  Prior-Wandesforde says.  And unless it changes a few things, it's going to struggle to achieve industry-led growth and infrastructure-led growth. 
India's labour relations laws and property regulations often work as an impediment to manufacturers, he says.
 The government also talks a good infrastructure story, but often fails to deliver,  according to Prior-Wandsforde.  A key distinction with China is that even as there is money around, the red tape and bureaucracy involved in getting big projects done is huge. Even if the money is there to be spent, it's not always easy to spend it. 
The history of the Dabhol LNG port is a good case in point. The LNG being shipped into the import facility will in the first instance be used to fuel GAIL India's Dabhol power station, which was originally built by failed US energy giant Enron before being shut down in May 2001 after a pricing dispute with the generator's sole customer, Mumbai's state-owned electricity supplier.
Plans to build a pipeline from Dabhol to India's IT capital of Bangalore are also in trouble due to disputes with landowners that have held up other developments for decades.
Capital Economics' Varathan says the recent spate of high-profile graft scandals has also taken some of the shine off India's good prospects for growth.
 Economic policies have clearly improved tremendously since 1991 and some public sector institutions have adjusted well,  he says.  Nevertheless, the Indian state is struggling overall to provide the high-quality institutions which are needed to support rapid growth.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"EAST Timor has renewed its criticism of Woodside over its plans to build a floating liquefied natural gas platform above the Timor Sea's Greater Sunrise field, warning of potential cost blowouts and accusing the company of making misleading statements.
Government spokesman Agio Pereira pointed to Standard & Poor's recent lowering of Woodside's credit rating after delays and higher costs at the company's Pluto project in Western Australia.
 He said a $US900 million ($A914 million) cost blowout and a six-month delay at Pluto because of the need to rebuild flare towers that did not meet cyclone specification  raises concern within the Timorese government given the potential cost blowouts for the untested floating LNG technology proposed by Woodside for Greater Sunrise .
 If similar cost blowouts were to occur with Greater Sunrise, the costs would effectively be paid for by the people of Timor-Leste [East Timor] before any revenue flowed to the nation,  Mr Pereira said.
East Timor and Woodside have been in an acrimonious standoff over the Greater Sunrise field since the Perth-based company announced earlier this year it would build one of the world's first floating platforms at the field. East Timor's leaders bluntly rejected Woodside's plans, demanding the gas be piped to a processing plant on its south coast, which would boost employment and provide greater revenue in the country, where most people live in poverty.
 The government has consistently maintained their position that the option of the pipeline to Timor-Leste is the safest and most economically viable, following the spirit of treaties covering the Timor Sea which promote shared benefits,  Mr Pereira said.
 The one productive field in the area, Bayu Undan, has its gas piped to Darwin, which has provided a huge boost to the Northern Territory's economy. 
East Timor's Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmao, has said that his country is prepared to forgo billions of dollars of revenue from Greater Sunrise if Woodside does not bring the gas to East Timor.
But Woodside's chief executive, Don Voelte, has insisted that East Timor cannot walk away from agreements it has made about developing the field.
Mr Pereira accused Woodside of continuing to  announce the Greater Sunrise project was progressing well when communications had all but ceased last year .
A Woodside spokesman declined to comment.
Woodside closed up 5Â¢ at $43.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"A CONTROVERSIAL $30 billion gas plant on the Kimberley coast is a step closer to approval, with a government report backing a site near James Price Point as the most commercially viable.
The draft strategic review for the federal and West Australian governments â€” due out on Monday, a year late â€” concedes there would be environmental effects from dredging and clearing native vegetation to build Woodside's liquefied natural gas processing plant.
 It also says several threatened species could be affected, including humpback whales, sea turtles and the greater bilby.
WA Premier Colin Barnett publicly nominated James Price Point as his preferred site â€” well before the outcome of the strategic assessment â€” and has moved to compulsorily acquire land from indigenous owners, saying he could not risk delays to a project expected to generate 6000 jobs.
But the WA government and Woodside are facing strong opposition from environmentalists, including celebrities Missy Higgins and former Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst.
A copy of the draft review was obtained by the Wilderness Society and given to The Age.
Two studies of sites outside the Kimberley cited by the review found the extra cost of piping would be prohibitive for the project's proponents.
But the society's WA co-ordinator, Peter Robertson, said the review had not properly considered sites outside the Kimberley, breaching a 2008 agreement between the WA and federal governments.
Last month, federal Environment Minister Tony Burke said of the issues involving the Kimberley:  You have an intersection of indigenous issues, economic resources and some of the most pristine and magnificent country I have ever seen. 
The draft review will released on Monday for public comment. The final report will be handed to Mr Burke early next year, with the plant's future subject to his final approval.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"ENERGY
EAST Timor says Woodside Petroleum's $2 billion cost blowout at the Pluto liquefied natural gas project does not bode well for the company's planned development of the Greater Sunrise gasfields in the Timor Sea.
 Woodside and its joint venture partners, Shell and ConocoPhillips, in April decided to develop the fields through a $US10 billion-plus floating LNG development, angering the East Timorese government, which wants an LNG plant built in the tiny nation.
Yesterday, East Timor used Woodside's November announcement, that flare towers not constructed to specification had pushed out costs to $14bn at Pluto, to help its case.
``This raises concern within the Timorese government, given the potential cost blowouts for the untested floating LNG technology proposed by Woodside for Greater Sunrise, which holds far greater risks than simple flare tower technology,'' government spokesman Agio Pereira said.
``If similar cost blowouts were to occur with Greater Sunrise, the costs would effectively be paid for by the people of Timor-Leste; before any revenue stream flowed to the nation.''
Mr Pereira did not say how the people would pay for the blowouts. The statement is the latest in a steady stream that East Timor has sent since April, when the partners settled on a floating LNG plant as their preferred option.
Shell will build the $US5bn floating LNG plant, while Woodside will oversee construction of the rest of the underwater development. East Timor said Woodside had relented to regulators' conditions in submitting information on the three development options -- floating LNG, an East Timor plant or a Darwin plant -- in recent months.
Woodside said in October that it had handed over the concept evaluation report.
It is understood the eventual report was basically the same one Woodside delivered in April, only for its executives to have the document thrown back into their cars as they were leaving by security in front of local media.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte has previously said an East Timor plant was the most expensive option and would cost $US5bn more than a floating LNG plant.
Mr Pereira yesterday said the Woodside report revealed that a pipeline to East Timor would cost $US400m less than a pipeline to Darwin.
``Independent studies commissioned by Timor-Leste indicate the cost savings with a pipeline to Timor-Leste are likely to be much higher,'' Mr Pereira said.
He did not deny Mr Voelte's comments that the report showed East Timor was the most expensive option.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"The explosion which caused the Gulf of Mexico oil spill took place shortly after a man who was monitoring vital safety equipment decided to leave his workstation for a cigarette break. An employee of the Halliburton subsidiary Sperry Sun, Joseph E. Keith, told investigators he failed to realise the well was filling with dangerous levels of crude oil and natural gas because he was in the canteen, having a smoke and a cup of coffee. By the time Mr Keith had resumed watching his monitors, which were tracking pressure levels on the Deepwater Horizon rig, the safety gauges had returned to normal, according to testimony he gave to the joint Coast Guard- Interior Department panel in Houston. Not long afterwards, a huge explosion on the BP rig killed 11 people, injured 17 others, and caused oil to begin leaking into the Gulf. Over the ensuing three months, about 709 million litres were released, in what is believed to be the worst accidental spill in history.
  Mr Keith had worked on the Deepwater Horizon for eight years. On the day of the blow-out, he recalled being uncomfortable with the number of activities taking place on the rig. The fatal cigarette break lasted 10 minutes, and he smoked just half of his cigarette before returning to his workstation. Had Mr Keith seen the pressure data which had emerged during his absence, he ''would have called the rig floor'' to warn colleagues that they were in danger. He did not hear the subsequent explosion and only realised something was seriously amiss half an hour later, when the screens he used to monitor drilling fluid in the small trailer where he worked began to bend and stretch because of intense heat. When he ran on to the deck of the stricken rig, Mr Keith discovered the body of a dead co- worker. He survived the ensuing fire, along with 114 other employees of BP and its subcontractors, by boarding a life raft. The eight-person Coastguard panel which heard his testimony is holding its sixth round of hearings into this year's disaster. A separate inquiry by a White House commission is also continuing, although members say their efforts to find out what went wrong are being obstructed by one of BP's suppliers, National Oilwell Varco.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Origin Energy will resume its controversial hydraulic fracturing operations at its Queensland coal seam gas fields after identifying a range of potential causes for the presence of cancer-causing chemicals in several wells.
Origin stopped work at 17 wells at its Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas joint venture with American company ConocoPhillips in October after low levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) were detected in water samples from eight wells.
 The company said on Friday that an investigation carried out under the eye of Queensland authorities had confirmed there were no environmental or health risks posed by the hydraulic fracturing, or  fraccing , activities.
Fraccing involves blasting water, chemicals and material into a well to open up cracks in coal seams, and concerns environmentalists and landowners who are opposed to the coal seam gas industry.
Origin did not find a definitive cause for the BTEX reading, saying it could have been an accidental contamination by lubricants and diesel, a now-discontinued fraccing fluid, or naturally occurring BTEX.
Origin and ConocoPhillips aim to approve the project for development as early as this month if they can secure customers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Relations between East Timor and Woodside Petroleum over the proposed $US8.6 billion Greater Sunrise liquefied natural gas project have plumbed new depths after the East Timorese government seized on Woodside's Australian project issues.
East Timor spokesman Agio Pereira said the recent credit rating downgrade to Woodside following the latest cost blowout at the $14 billion Pluto LNG development in Western Australia reinforced the country's concerns about the Perth-based oil and gas producer's capabilities to deliver the Sunrise project.
 Woodside and East Timor have been in a dispute over the best method of developing Greater Sunrise, a portion of which sits in a joint development area controlled by the Australian and East Timorese governments.
Woodside and its partners in the project earlier this year selected floating LNG processing as the best method for developing the project, with the concept winning out over plans to pipe the gas to LNG facilities in either Darwin or East Timor.
East Timor has vowed not to authorise any development that does not involve processing facilities in East Timor.
In a statement released on Friday, Mr Pereira noted the last cost blowout at Pluto had stemmed from the installation of flare towers â€“ which are a  well established, tried and tested technology  â€“ that did not meet cyclone specifications.
 This raises concern within the Timorese government given the potential cost blowouts for the untested floating LNG technology proposed by Woodside for Greater Sunrise, which holds far greater risks than simple flare-tower technology,  Mr Pereira said.
 If similar cost blowouts were to occur with Greater Sunrise, the costs would effectively be paid for by the People of Timor-Leste; before any revenue stream flowed to the nation. 
While Woodside declined to respond to the comments, UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said the flare tower situation at Pluto could not be directly compared to the construction of a floating LNG vessel for Sunrise.
 How can the failure of the Pluto LNG project flare-tower contractor to take into account the wind loading requirement specified by Woodside have anything to do with the proposal to develop Sunrise using Shell's game-changing FLNG technology?  Mr Ramsay said.
In its latest quarterly report released in October, Woodside said it had handed over to East Timor details of the three development options for the project.
East Timor said the documents revealed that a pipeline from the field to East Timor would cost around $400 million less than a pipeline to Darwin.
KEY POINTS
East Timor says Woodside's credit downgrade is a concern.
The nation wants the Greater Sunrise gas processed in the country, not on a vessel.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"Ms Razzaq said, ''We are conducting a review. It is not ideal and we have been working hard to rectify that. ''We recently implemented changes to existing natural gas Even Pay arrangements. Since implementing these changes we have identified a number of issues, such as those experienced by your readers,'' she said. After a report by Consumer Voice last Sunday on the Even Pay system, the Sunday Canberra Times received many emails from
people who had been charged close to double what they owed and who had battled with ActewAGL's accounts department to have these errors corrected. Some have scrapped the Even Pay arrangement after ActewAGL staff were prevented by its computer system from re-establishing a suitable agreed payment. Martin Page, of Waramanga, has paid his gas account for 10 years under Even Pay. He was so upset at having his account cancelled without notice that he wrote to ActewAGL chief executive Michael Costello, but has received no reply.
 ''I would rather pay a realistic, consistent amount and have the extra money in my pocket than pay extremely high amounts for six months, followed by very low amounts to balance out the disproportionate, unjustified initial payments,'' he said. Of further embarrassment to ActewAGL, and of considerable annoyance to some customers, some Even Pay accounts were cancelled without customers receiving letters advising of their new, over-estimated payments. Ms Razzaq said she did not know why this had occurred.
''The billing system is quite complicated,'' she said. She gave an assurance people paying electricity and water accounts had not been affected by the error. Gas customers were on a separate billing system managed by AGL. Gas customers had been migrated to that system in 2008. Despite around a third of Even Pay customers being affected, MsRazzaq defended the system. ''Even Pay has been great,'' she said. ''It helps customers to average costs.''
Clearly embarrassed by the error, she said the review process had been stopped. Instead, a review of letters sent to 3000 customers would seek to identify accounts which had been over-estimated. ''We will be investigating the complaints you have sent through and contacting each of the customers to address the issues they have experienced and apologise for any confusion caused by this review.'' Customers with queries about their natural gas Even Pay arrangements were encouraged to call ActewAGL on 131 886.

 But it is an exploration well so we're looking to determine the depth and the interval over which the gas is present. 
Swansea MP Robert Coombs has moved to assure the community that the project is still exploratory.
 That doesn't meant to say that it's carte blanche opportunity to go and drill or anything like this,  he said.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2010,4,"MARK COLVIN: Environmentalists have attacked a new report that gives a positive assessment of a massive gas plant north of Broome.
The Federal and West Australian Governments initiated the Strategic Assessment Report to look at the possible impacts of the controversial liquefied natural gas development.
 The assessment says the proposed precinct will have an impact on marine life but this and other impacts can be managed.
David Weber reports.
DAVID WEBER: Environmentalists have been calling for a site to be established in the Pilbara region where there's already a concentration of industry.
The Wilderness Society's Peter Robertson says there should've been a more detailed analysis of the options.
PETER ROBERTSON: One of the fundamental aspects of the agreement that the Commonwealth and State governments signed in February 2008 was that options for processing Browse gas outside of the Kimberley needed to be properly studied.
And ever since then the WA Government and particularly since the election of Premier Barnett, the WA Government has simply refused to look at options outside of the Kimberley.
DAVID WEBER: Mr Robertson says there's been minimal analysis of the possibilities outside of the Kimberley region.
He says this is strange when there have been reports that some of the joint venture partners don't want to process gas in the Kimberley.
Peter Robertson describes the scale of the project as truly scary.
PETER ROBERTSON: We're talking about a project that's going to include 14 pipelines both going out to sea and coming onshore from the drilling rigs out in the Browse Basin.
You're talking about between 12 and 39 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per annum. They're talking about seven to 24 billion litres of groundwater that would need to be extracted from local aquifers.
You're also looking at the removal of about 1.5 kilometres of shoreline at James Price Point. And you're looking at 21 million cubic metres of dredging in the marine environment to create a shipping channel.
DAVID WEBER: Indigenous people in and around Broome are divided as to whether the project should go ahead.
More than $1.5 billion has been negotiated in compensation and benefits for Aboriginal people in the region.
But Peter Robertson says the gas plant could still be established elsewhere and the funds set aside.
PETER ROBERTSON: There is no reason why the Commonwealth couldn't guarantee that a portion of the royalty income that it will derive from the exploitation of the Browse gas field could not be allocated to Kimberley communities regardless of where the gas is actually processed.
And there are many precedents for governments both state and federal to separate the location of any particular industrial development from the allocation of benefits.
DAVID WEBER: WA's Department of State Development says the review is the most wide-ranging of any project in the state.
The department's deputy director-general Gail McGowan.
GAIL MCGOWAN: This process began in 2007 when we started looking at the potential of some 40 plus sites across the Kimberley, narrowing that down to James Price Point as a location at which the impact can best be managed.
DAVID WEBER: The terms of reference said that the report would be looking at the other options aside from the Kimberley and it seems that that doesn't seem to be contained in the report. Is that because James Price Point has been firmed up as the viable option?
GAIL MCGOWAN: There are two issues there. One is that the studies conducted during the site selection process concluded that that Pilbara option would not be economically viable or environmentally desirable.
And certainly the West Australian Government is developing the LNG processing and export precinct to ensure that the benefits from processing gas from the Browse Basin are actually delivered directly to West Kimberley communities, bearing in mind that 42 per cent of the Kimberley population is Indigenous and that compares to the state average of 3 per cent.
DAVID WEBER: If it wasn't to be a single user hub would the possible option be, or could there be, a whole heap of processing sites up and down the Kimberley?
GAIL MCGOWAN: Absolutely and that's where the Government actually started this process from to avoid that ad hoc development on the Kimberley coast.
You've got to recognise that the entire area of the Kimberley is something like 424,000 square kilometres. We're talking about an area of 25 square kilometres, a small area on that coast where we can actually manage at least two and more, potentially more processes, rather than as you say have ad hoc development up and down the coast and its attendant environmental and social impacts.
DAVID WEBER: The Strategic Assessment Report is open for public comment.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"More reports of bill distress among ActewAGL's Even Pay system customers emerged yesterday. The Sunday Canberra Times reported that more than 3000 customers who were linked to the payment system were overcharged on their natural gas bills because of a computer glitch. Lyneham disabled pensioner Luke
Robbie said he was almost overcharged on his gas bill but not because of a computer problem. Mr Robbie was contacted about 7pm early last month by what he thought was a call centre in India, about his Even Pay account. Before the call Mr Robbie had assumed an annual total of his ActewAGL account was averaged out on a fortnightly basis over 12 months and deducted from his bank account.
 ''I got a phone call ... saying that because of my last six-month gas bill, it was going to have to go up to $69 a fortnight from $41.58,'' he said. ''I thought, like hell .. . I couldn't afford a massive chunk like that ... and the next day I rang ActewAGL to find out what was going on.'' According to ActewAGL, if annual usage varies, payment amounts are adjusted accordingly but ActewAGL must first notify the customer in
writing to inform them of the new total. ''The guy said, 'We don't know what's going on, it's supposed to be worked out over your last 12 months, not your last six months, but we've been having problems with people getting phone calls from these people who are affiliated with AGL and they're basing it over a six-month period when they should be basing it over the full 12 months','' Mr Robbie
said. ''It showed that with mine it should go up to $48, not $69.'' Mr Robbie said his gas bill had been $41.58 for more than two years. ''The left hand is not telling the right hand what's going on. ''AGL are doing one thing and ActewAGL have had to turn around and fix it.'' An ActewAGL spokesman said AGL would have contacted Mr Robbie on ActewAGL's behalf as AGL handled
all billing associated with its gas customers. ''They're still based in Canberra, at the old ActewAGL house, that's where the call centre is.'' The spokesman hadn't heard of an incident like Mr Robbie's and said he would have to look into the individual case before commenting. ''There might have been a legitimate reason for the call, I really don't know,'' he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Oil and gas producer Santos looks set to formally approve its $18 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project as early as this week, in a move that could trigger a $1 billion-plus equity raising.
Santos has been targeting a final investment decision on the first train, or processing line, at GLNG before the end of this year, and with Christmas less than two weeks away faces a tight timetable to sanction the project.
 While Santos has already secured sufficient funding for its share of capital costs for the first GLNG train through hybrid bond issues and the sale of equity stakes in the project to Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total, it is also believed to have secured a quartet of banks to examine a potential capital raising.
Santos has already secured all required environmental approvals, and has commitments from Petronas and Total to purchase the bulk of the first train's LNG output.
The upcoming final investment decision will only cover the first train at GLNG, with the second train expected to be approved for development next year.
The company has been working to secure another long-term gas sales agreement with state-owned energy giant Korea Gas, but the deal has been stalled as it awaits the South Korean government's sign-off.
Kogas is believed to want to purchase up to 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from GLNG, which would account for the remaining volumes from the first two LNG trains not already contracted.
While finally securing Kogas as a partner and customer for GLNG would be a boost for Santos and the project, CLSA analyst Di Brookman said Santos's recent comments about its preparedness to approve the project without another gas sales deal meant the market wasn't expecting a breakthrough before the final investment decision.
Ms Brookman said she expected GLNG to be approved in the coming days or face a challenge in sanctioning it this year.
 I think they'd have to do it soon. If they didn't do it next week, you'd think it would have to wait,  Ms Brookman said last Friday.
Analysts have predicted Santos could need to raise $1 billion to $2 billion to cover its share of capital costs over the development of the project's two trains.
Merrill Lynch analyst James Bullen earlier this month said Santos could comfortably fund the first train out of its current cash position and urged the company to delay a raising for 12 months while it proved up gas and secured customers for the second train.
 Santos should raise equity when they have a clearer line of sight to GLNG train two [final investment decision],  Mr Bullen said.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay believes Santos is unlikely to strike its deal with Kogas before it makes its final investment decision on GLNG. Mr Ramsay said the upcoming approval could be limited to ordering long lead-time items and starting civil works, giving the company more time to lock in the Kogas deal and, subsequently, an equity raising.
He noted that any equity raising in the current environment would likely need to be carried out at less than the price offered under Santos's May 2009 equity raising at $12.50 per share.
 We think it will be very difficult for Santos to go back to its investors and raise funding for an advanced GLNG project, but at pricing that is a material discount to an earlier equity raising,  Mr Ramsay said in a recent note.
Santos shares closed up 9Â¢ to $12.54 on Friday.

AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"RESOURCES
PUBLIC submissions have been called for into Woodside's $30 billion liquefied natural gas hub on Western Australia's Kimberley coast, as environmentalists and celebrity campaigners increase their opposition to the development.
 The WA Department of State Development's statutory strategic assessment report was released for comment yesterday. Final project approval rests with state and federal environment authorities.
The development, which has BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron and Shell as joint-venture partners, has been the subject of a campaign by environmentalists, traditional owners and celebrities who have called for it to be rejected at the planned James Price Point site.
Greenpeace used the release of the assessment, which found a relatively low environmental impact from the gas hub, to exploit perceived troubles within the joint venture.
Greenpeace campaigner Trish Harrup called on the joint-venture partners to push for their stated preference and build the project at the brownfields Karratha site.
 Clearly neither Premier Colin Barnett nor Woodside are concerned about the kind of reputational damage that will come from such a bloody-minded approach,  she said.
 However, across the globe, communities will be watching the joint-venture partners, BHP Billiton, Shell, BP, Chevron, to see if they are willing to become party to this kind of environmental vandalism.
 Following the Gulf catastrophe, BP efforts should be on restoring its reputation rather than engaging in resource extraction in an environmentally fragile area. Similarly, Shell's global brand has been damaged by its operations in Nigeria and the last thing it needs is another battle along a front consisting of environmentalists, indigenous people and those concerned with good corporate governance. 
Disquiet in the joint venture has been building. In September, Shell Australia chairman Ann Pickard warned Woodside and the West Australian government not to back stakeholders into a corner. Last month, BHP chairman Jac Nasser told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Perth that BHP  won't proceed with any development where our values and standards are compromised in any way .
Singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, one of the key celebrity campaigners, also announced the first in what could be several events designed to raise money for the  save the Kimberley  cause. Higgins will perform a one-off Melbourne show next month and proceeds will be used to attract expert scientists to scrutinise the strategic assessment and provide submissions to the WA EPA.
Submissions on the report can be lodged until March 8.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE rush to turn a dollar out of Queensland's coal seam gas boom continued yesterday as Transfield Services outlayed $575 million for the Toowoomba-bred well drilling and servicing group, Easternwell.
The deal would seem likely to significantly add to the wealth of Easternwell's founding Campbell family, and its private equity partner, Ironbridge Capital. Though not as much perhaps as some observers, who in the past month had been touting a float of Easternwell for as much as $720 million.
 It is believed half of Easternwell - which was founded by continuing chief executive Troy Campbell's father in 1976 - is owned by management and other smaller shareholders and half by Ironbridge.
Mr Campbell did not return calls yesterday but Easternwell's management and other smaller shareholders will take part of their consideration for the sale, some $35 million, in Transfield shares.
And they will also be in line for an ``earn-out'', of up to $17 million if certain unspecified earnings milestones are reached in the year ending June 2012.
Transfield said the deal was on a ``cash-free and debt-free basis'' - apparently leaving smaller shareholders and Ironbridge to cover any current Easternwell debt.
For Transfield, the deal provides a significant broadening of its current service offering, and into areas of the energy and mining industry which are relatively high margin.
``This acquisition is consistent with our stated strategic objective to expand our services and capabilities into adjacent sectors and to pursue higher value work,'' Transfield Services chief executive Peter Goode said yesterday.
``We were looking for an acquisition that would shift the needle,'' he said. ``We wanted something that would be substantial and could stand on its own as a business and as a market leader.''
Others capitalising on the CSG boom include the Toowoomba-based Wagner group's joint venture with Scottish specialist energy services company Wood Group and Dalby-based civil engineering contractor Ostwald Bros.
Easternwell is expected to contribute more than $40 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to Transfield for the six months ending June 30, 2011, the company said. On top of the $35 million in shares, Transfield will pay cash of $540 million for Easternwell, which Ironbridge built by combining the Toowoomba group with Australian Drilling Solutions.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Transfield Services is poised to benefit from greater exposure to the thriving coal seam gas and iron ore sectors following the acquisition of drilling services group Easternwell Corporation for $575 million.
As foreshadowed in The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column, Transfield yesterday announced an agreement to buy Easternwell, which is majority-owned by private equity firm Ironbridge Capital.
 Easternwell derives around 40 per cent of its annual revenue from well servicing activities in the coal seam gas sector in Queensland and is the largest provider of mine dewatering services to the Western Australian iron ore sector.
 The acquisition rationale for Easternwell is compelling for many reasons, we believe,  Transfield chief executive Peter Goode told analysts and investors yesterday.  Importantly, it is very much aligned with our stated strategy, and also with my personal experience in the upstream oil and gas business.
 It sets a platform for growth and broadens our presence in the reÂ­sources sector, where we have a prominent position in Australia already, even further. 
The deal marks Transfield's first acquisition under Mr Goode, who joined the company in October 2008 with a mandate to restore its financial performance after a debt-fuelled acquisition spree almost brought its undoing.
Transfield will fund the Easternwell purchase through a combination of debt and equity, but Mr Goode said the structure would ensure the company maintained  a conservative level of gearing with ongoing balance sheet flexibility .
JPMorgan is acting as lead manager and underwriter on a 2-for-9 accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer priced at $3 a share to raise $294 million. The price represents a 14 per cent discount to Transfield's last-traded price of $3.50 on Friday.
At the same time, the company has refinanced its debt facilities, securing commitments from the majority of existing lenders for $915 million, of which $271 million will be drawn down for the Easternwell transaction.
Transfield will also issue $35 million in new shares to senior Easternwell employees who are shareholders in the company, while an earn-out of $17 million is payable if certain earnings milestones are achieved by the end of financial year 2012.
Based on an enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation measure, the price being paid by Transfield did not appear excessive, Deutsche Bank analyst Craig Wong-Pan said.
 If you look at the price they paid, it's EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.6 times. Compare that to the sector. Transfield was on 9.2 times and the sector average was 8.8 times. 
Mr Wong-Pan also viewed the acÂ­quisition as a positive because it gave the company greater leverage to the resources sector, and represented a move up the value chain.
 It's going into a new area that has higher margins. The Easternwell business has reported a 26 per cent EBITDA margin previously, and that is significantly higher than Transfield's. It's moving up that value chain, providing more value-added services. 
Transfield expects Easternwell to contribute more than $40 million to its EBITDA in the six months to the end of June. But the company has not changed its full-year profit guidance. Mr Goode reiterated that subject to economic conditions, the forecast was for a mid-single-digit percentage increase on financial year 2010's $96Â million net profit after tax, with earnings skewed to the second half.
Earlier this year, Ironbridge appointed Macquarie Group to run a dual-track process assessing both an initial public offering and a trade sale for Easternwell.
Mr Goode was one of the first trade buyers Easternwell chief executive Troy Campbell approached and Transfield was granted the right to conduct due diligence on an exclusive basis.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"CSG EDS: updates with comment from Qld Resources Council
BRISBANE, Dec 15 AAP - One of the world's leading investment banks has poured cold water on Queensland's emerging $50 billion coal seam gas industry.
 A report by JP Morgan says the industry has significant water risks, an unknown impact from growth and is a potential risk to public safety.
The report, by analyst Garry Sherriff, says costs involved in developing the projects, which involve piping gas from the Surat Basin to export terminals at Gladstone, are likely to blow out because of environmental concerns.
It warns that towns and landowners risk reduced water supplies; there is a risk of reduced water quality; and of gas migrating to existing bores.
Once on the surface, the saline water extracted in the CSG mining process will have to be treated, stored and disposed of, the report says.
JP Morgan also expresses doubts about the cumulative impact from multiple CSG developments.
These water risks could translate into project cost increases, government intervention, changes to regulations and potential disruption to long-term gas supply contracts, the report says.
There is also a danger that a build-up of gas in water bores could result in large, uncontrolled gas releases which may pose a risk to public health and safety, the report says.
JP Morgan's report backs up community concerns over the industry, says Friends of the Earth campaigner Drew Hutton.
 It is time for the state government to start listening to community voices calling for a moratorium on the industry,  Mr Hutton said.
 The report states there are so many environmental risks associated with the operation of coal seam gas that the government will need to change the rules along the way and this could create great uncertainty for the companies and their markets,  Mr Hutton said.
He said when the impacts of the industry are realised, the public would demand much more rigorous regulation.
 This could drastically change the ground rules for the companies and cause cost blow-outs,  he said.
 The state government is pursuing a very risky strategy for economic development by putting so much faith in this one fallible industry and the (state opposition) LNP is supporting it every inch of the way,  Mr Hutton said.
 Investment experts are urging caution and I am calling on Queensland's leaders to do the same. 
Resources Minister Stephen Robertson said the state government was committed to protecting groundwater resources.
 The emerging CSG industry offers enormous potential but the government insists this cannot come at any cost,  he said.
 We passed legislation in parliament in November that strengthens the protection of Queensland's water bores and natural springs near coal seam gas projects.
 The government makes no apologies for insisting that all resource proposals are held to strict environmental and safety standards,  Mr Robertson said.
 It's what the community expects. 
Chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council Michael Roche said any resource project contained risk.
 You also need to look at the risk management strategies,  he said.
 Those risk management strategies for LNG and coal seam gas projects are covered in huge detail,  he said.
The strategies were in both the proponents' environmental impact statements and in government restrictions on the industry, Mr roche said.

Recently, a meeting in Brisbane put together a plan to boost the hunt for new mine and extraction sites, and a new organisation, called the Queensland Exploration Council, was formed.
 Michael Roche, of the Qld Resources Council, says the Exploration Council is a group of like-minded people with a shared vision of positioning Queensland as the Australian leader in exploration by 2020.
He says the state has been living for too long off the discoveries of the past and there is a danger that production rates will start to deplete the known resource.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"ONE of the world's biggest merchant banks has raised serious questions about the reliability and safety of the $50 billion coal seam gas industry, citing the potential for large, uncontrolled gas releases.
The National Water Commission has claimed Queensland underground aquifers could be depleted and take centuries to recover because of gas extraction.
 Now a report by JP Morgan says the industry has significant water risks, an unknown impact from growth and is a potential risk to public safety.
The industry agreed the report raised important issues but said they were addressed in the 1500 conditions imposed on the CSG projects.
The report also warned that the costs involved in developing the projects that will pipe gas from the Surat Basin to export terminals at Gladstone were likely to blow out because of environmental concerns, particularly over water and compensation to farmers.
The detailed report by analyst Garry Sherriff also indicated that it expected the CSG companies would have to pay clean-up costs for salt-affected areas and future legal liabilities to aggrieved landowners.
It cited six key water concerns caused by the industry, including a reduction in the water supply to towns and landowners, reduced quality, gas migration to water bores and the safe storage of salt.
It also warned that the State Government had shown its hand in its overwhelming action against Cougar Energy, an underground coal gasification plant near Kingaroy, which has been shut down for months over a chemical scare despite tests giving it the all clear.
Although Mr Sherriff said well built gas wells could prevent gas moving into water bores, he added there was a potential that ``the build-up of gas in water bores can result in large uncontrolled releases of gas, which may pose a risk to public health and safety''.
Mr Sherriff said the cumulative impacts of multiple CSG developments were unknown. It was also not known whether CSG companies had provided environmental bonds to the Government to cover potential site clean-ups.
Agforce spokesman Wayne Newton said the report backed the community's call for a moratorium on CSG until more was known on its cumulative impacts.
``More and more people are starting to raise concerns and we have not had our questions answered,'' he said.
Wandoan farmer Pat Devlin said the problem was that few people in Brisbane had any idea of what was coming.
He said his biggest worry was the land contamination from the amount of salt that would be extracted along with the gas.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"ORIGIN Energy chief Grant King's hopes of signing off on the multibillion-dollar Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone before year's end have been dashed.
It had been Origin and US partner ConocoPhillips' long-held aim to join BG Group, and potentially Santos, in having their massive LNG plant plans given the green light before the new year.
 But federal Environment Minister Tony Burke yesterday knocked that possibility on the head, telling Origin his assessment of Australia Pacific's environmental impact statement would not be forthcoming until late February.
It was originally due next week.
Mr Burke has already ticked off BG's Curtis Island LNG and Santos's Gladstone LNG projects.
Both projects, like Australia Pacific's and Shell's Curtis Island ventures, plan to pipe coal seam gas from central Queensland to a hub in Gladstone Harbour where it will be converted to LNG and exported.
And although Mr Burke's sign-offs were subject to many conditions, Origin was expecting to also get an acceptable conditional go-ahead - for a project it has said could eventually cost $35 billion.
It was otherwise a very good day for Origin. It and Hong Kong-owned TRUenergy have emerged as the winning bidders in the NSW Government's $5.3 billion power sell-off.
Origin says it paid a ``fair price'' for its $3.25 billion share of the electricity assets and the market agreed, pushing its shares 30c higher to $17.10.
But the market had closed before news of the Australia Pacific delay emerged.
Analysts had seen the project as running well behind BG's and Santos's because it had not signed up customers to underpin its development. But only weeks ago Conoco chief executive Jim Mulva said Australia Pacific would have customer signatures, to underpin its early stages, before the end of the year.
Origin said yesterday that Mr Burke's office had said the delay wasn't due to a call for further information from Australia Pacific - which might imply unease at its proposal - but ``rather to allow sufficient time for a full assessment of the project and in recognition of the impact of the forthcoming Christmas and New Year holiday period.''
Australia Pacific, like the BG and Santos projects, already has Queensland Government approval. But ``Commonwealth approval is the next step in gaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the project in order to pave the way for a final investment decision,'' Australia Pacific project director Page Maxson said.
``The project will not be able to proceed to FID (final investment decision) until such time as the EIS approval process is complete.''
The project's future - given significant landholder unease at the massive scale of the proposed coal seam gas-to-LNG industry in Queensland - was clouded last month after traces of contaminants including the carcinogen benzene were found in fluid samples taken from eight of Origin's coal seam gas exploration wells in Queensland.
But Australia Pacific later said a comprehensive investigation into traces of BTEX chemicals in the well water showed there was no risk to the environment or human health.
As reported in The Courier-Mail yesterday, JP Morgan, one of the world's biggest merchant banks, has raised serious questions about the reliability and safety of Queensland's emerging coal seam gas industry, citing the potential for large, uncontrolled gas releases.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips's $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas joint venture has formally confirmed it will miss its year-end deadline for a final investment decision after being hit with a two-month delay by the federal government.
The APLNG partners have been waiting for federal Environment Minister Tony Burke to approve their environmental impact statement, having received the all-clear from the Queensland government.
 On Wednesday, the minister said he would delay his decision from December 21 to February 22 due to the  scale and complexity  of the project.
APLNG's experience mirrors that of its two rival LNG projects in Queensland, namely BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG development and the Santos-led Gladstone LNG project, in being delayed by the federal government.
But Origin yesterday stressed that, unlike the delays sustained by BG and Santos, its delay did not require the APLNG partners to provide addition information to Mr Burke.
 He [Mr Burke] noted the extension was not for the purpose of seeking further information, but rather to allow sufficient time for a full assessment of the project and in recognition of the impact of the forthcoming Christmas and new year holiday period,  Origin said in a statement.
APLNG project director Page Maxson confirmed the project cannot proceed to a final investment decision until the environmental approval process is complete.
Earlier on Wednesday, Origin managing director Grant King told The Australian Financial Review the company was committed to the project despite the delays.
 We remain absolutely committed to proceeding with APLNG on as fast a timetable as we can,  Mr King said.
 Back in October 2008 we were targeting December [for a final investment decision], we're damn nearly there in respect to all the consents, we've got the Queensland consents. Christmas has probably got us in terms of the [federal] regulatory consents.
 But we will be at it hard in the new year. 
Origin and Conoco, which each hold a 50 per cent stake in the project, won environmental approval from Queensland in November despite a toxin scare on eight exploration wells during drilling in October.
The APLNG partners last week said it would resume full work at the project's gas fields after finishing their investigation into the detection of the toxins in water samples at some of its coal seam gas wells.
In his letter to the APLNG partners outlining the reasons for the latest delay, Mr Burke said his department had received information about APLNG's response to the toxin scare as well as advice from Queensland's Department of Environment and Resource Management.
 DERM has advised that it does not consider that landholder bores will be impacted as a result of these incidents, and that there is no evidence of unlawful environmental harm,  Mr Burke said.
Mr Burke, who replaced Peter Garrett in the environment ministry in the wake of August's federal election, has already approved the projects of both BG and Santos.
BG has since approved its project for development, while Santos is aiming to make a final investment decision on its project before the end of this year. Analysts have said the decision could come as early as this week.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee noted that APLNG's chances of being approved this year had already looked unlikely even before the delay, given the partners are yet to lock in any buyers for gas from the project.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"ORIGIN Energy's hopes of securing customers and board approval this year for the $35 billion Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project at Gladstone have been torpedoed by a two-month delay to a federal government decision on the plan.
Environment Minister Tony Burke said yesterday he would not make a ruling on APLNG by the December 21 date he had been targeting, and pushed the deadline out to February 22.
 Even though the two other big LNG projects recently given government approval at Gladstone -- BG Group's Curtis LNG and Santos's Gladstone LNG -- were delayed by Mr Burke, Mr King had expected APLNG to move through quickly because of investigations done on the other two projects.
The delay means comments by Jim Mulva -- the chairman of Origin's APLNG partner, ConocoPhillips -- that he expected to have two LNG trains worth of gas sold by the end of the year, will not come to fruition.
``Regulatory consents and the customers go hand in hand,'' Mr King told The Australian yesterday.
``But the comment we've made consistently and continue to make is that we are in negotiations with customers we think can trigger the project and that remains . . . true.''
APLNG project director Page Maxson said a final investment decision would be delayed until at least after environmental approval had been received.
In a letter to Origin, Mr Burke said the December 21 timeline was too challenging for such a large project. The Christmas-New Year break was also a factor, Mr Burke said.
When the Labor government delayed the other two projects, then environment minister Peter Garrett had asked for more information about the impact of the projects. ``We don't believe there is anything project-specific (in the delay),'' Mr King said.
``It's more of a workload issue -- and their ability to do the necessary diligence in their review process.''
APLNG received Queensland environmental approval on November 9.
Despite having gained environmental approval, Santos is running out of time to meet its self-imposed deadline for a 2010 final investment decision for GLNG and embark on a long-flagged equity-raising.
Origin said yesterday that it planned to conduct an equity-raising in the next 12 months.
The raising will pay off debt associated with its successful $3.25bn bid for NSW power assets and, if an investment decision is reached, will help fund Origin's commitments to APLNG.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2010,4,"SANTOS MELBOURNE, Dec 17 AAP - Santos Ltd says it has sold a 15 per cent stake in its Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) and flagged a $500 million capital raising.
The gas giant has also signed an off-take agreement with state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) for 3.5 million tonnes per annum, it told the stock exchange on Friday.
 Under the terms of the new agreements, Santos will sell an aggregate 15 per cent of GLNG to French company Total and KOGAS.
The sale price is a little higher than a 15 per cent stake in GLNG Santos offloaded to Total in September for $650 million, which was below market expectations.
Santos said it intended to hold a $500 million equity raising by issuing 39.8 million shares at a placement price of $12.55 per share.

MELBOURNE, Dec 17 AAP - Santos Ltd is poised to make a final decision on the Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) project, after selling a stake in the project and signing a $US120 billion sales off-take deal.
 Santos has also flagged a $500 million equity raising to help pay for its share of the $US16 billion project, which will be among the first to utilise Queensland's massive coal seam gas reserves.
The gas giant on Friday said it had sold a 7.5 per cent stake in GLNG to Korean Gas Corp (KOGAS) and another 7.5 per cent to French company Total for a combined $665 million.
KOGAS, the largest LNG buyer in the world, will also purchase 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of gas from the project over 20 years, worth more than $US120 billion at consensus oil prices, Santos says.
The state-run KOGAS will have a 15 per cent stake in GLNG, after a parallel deal announced on Friday for it to buy 7.5 per cent of the project from Malaysia's PETRONAS.
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services placed Santos' debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications after the deals were announced, saying GLNG was significantly transformational for the gas company.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the agreements paved the way for the GLNG partners to make a final investment decision on two gas trains, rather than one.
 The stars have really aligned for GLNG in recent weeks and today's agreements with KOGAS and Total mean that we can make the final investment decision (FID) in January,  Mr Knox said in a teleconference from Seoul, where the deals with KOGAS were signed.
When Santos sold a 15 per cent stake in GLNG in September for $US650 million, the company's share price was pushed lower with investors disappointed at the price tag.
But Mr Knox said the combined $665 million paid by Total and KOGAS was part of an  extremely powerful  package.
 We have underpinned a two-train project. We have got a very strong set of partners and we have moved the project towards FID in January,  he told journalists.
He said the equity raising completed Santos' funding needs for its share of the GLNG project.
Under the terms of the raising, which is only to institutions, Santos will issue 39.8 million shares at a placement price of $12.55 per share.
State One Stockbroking energy analyst Peter Kopetz said the announcements were good news for Santos.
 With Santos getting KOGAS across the line, they have locked up about 7 mtpa altogether which means that the two trains can go ahead,  Mr Kopetz said.
 I am expecting the FID in January will be positive. 
After completion of the deals, Santos will retain a 30 per cent stake in GLNG, with PETRONAS holding 27.5 per cent, Total having 27.5 per cent, and KOGAS with 15 per cent.
Shares in Santos went into pre-market trading halt on Friday, last trading at $12.97.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"A South Korean company has signed an agreement with Santos to buy 3.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Queensland each year.
KOGAS will take a 15 per cent stake in the Gladstone LNG project and French company Total has also increased its stake by 7.5 per cent.
 The project will source gas from the Surat Basin in the southern inland and the Bowen Basin in north Queensland, west of Mackay.
The gas would be piped to central Queensland for processing.
Premier Anna Bligh says it is good news for the state's economy.
 The Santos gas agreement with Korea is one of the largest gas deals ever done in Australia and it's happening right here in our state,  she said.
 These international agreements mean that we're exporting cleaner, greener energy into the Asia region.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2010,4,"SANTOS'S Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas project has cleared all hurdles for a 2010 green light with a $70 billion Korea Gas sales and equity deal to be announced in Brisbane today and an equity raising to follow.
The raising, which will be done through Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, will be for between $500 million and $1bn.
 Santos will go into a trading halt as the raising takes place, with a final investment decision on the project expected next week.
Under the sales and equity deal, Korea Gas will take a 15 per cent stake in GLNG and agree to buy 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG, or a full LNG train's worth, for 20 years.
Santos has previously said 5 million tonnes of LNG sales over 20 years represented $100bn of revenue, meaning Korea Gas's offtake could be expected to bring in $70bn.
The Korea Gas stake will drop Santos's GLNG stake from 45 per cent to 30 per cent, but the company will retain its position as the leading shareholder in GLNG.
But Santos's dominance of the project will be substantially reduced and it will only just be the biggest shareholder.
According to reports citing the South Korean government, part of the deal will involve French oil company Total, which joined the project in September, boosting its stake from 20 to 27.5 per cent.
Malaysia's Petronas will reduce its stake from 35 to 27.5 per cent.
Korea Gas has been in talks with Santos for months.
Santos has said a final investment decision will be taken this year on the first train of a two-train project, which analysts estimate will cost $20bn in total.
A decision on a second train is targeted within 12 months.
Total and Petronas had already agreed to take the gas from the first train as part of deals to buy a combined 5 million tonnes a year of LNG.
But Santos chief executive David Knox has said that if the long-awaited deal with Korea Gas was signed, some of the gas volumes from the first train could be given to the gas company.
Investors will be closely watching the price Korea Gas pays for its 15 per cent stake.
Santos shares took a battering in September, when Total paid $650m for a 15 per cent stake. But as part of the deal, Santos had to forfeit an extra $US500m it had been due from Petronas.
Analysts have valued a 15 per cent stake in the project at between $500m and $1bn.
News of the deal came yesterday, when newswires reported a South Korean government statement revealing the size of the LNG and stake sales, but not the value.
Santos shares jumped when the reports came out, ending 37c, or 3 per cent, higher at $12.97.
The company put out a statement saying it remained in talks with Korea Gas but had not reached a definitive agreement.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said that while the extent of the sell-down was a surprise, and details, including the money to be handed to Santos, were not known, it was a positive development.
``If it's lower equity, it may mean they are going to get more money in the door,'' Mr Ramsay said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"LONG-running negotiations between Santos and Korea Gas, which will give Santos' Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas the final sales volumes it needs to underwrite its $15 billion to $18 billion plant, have been concluded, according to reports out of Korea.
Kogas, the world's biggest buyer of LNG, has reportedly agreed to buy a 15 per cent stake in the Santos-led GLNG venture and signed on to take 3.5 million tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years, starting in 2015. And there is a suggestion, attributed to the Korean Energy Ministry, that there will be a realignment of the equity stakes of other partners in the project, leaving Santos with 30 per cent and Malaysia's Petronas and French Energy giant Total with 27.5 per cent each.
 But it is unclear whether the supposed deal will allow Santos to make a final investment decision in the next week, something it had hoped to do before year's end.
News agency Bloomberg said South Korea's Energy Ministry, on which Santos and Kogas had reportedly been waiting for formal approval, had confirmed the deal. Santos yesterday ``noted speculation'' that the Kogas deal had been done. While confirmed discussions were ``advanced'', it said the two had ``not yet reached a definitive agreement''.
That leaves the UK's BG Group, through Queensland Gas Company, leading the pack of four major proponents who hope to build plants on Gladstone harbour's Curtis Island. Origin Energy's plans this week hit a hurdle with the Federal Government putting off a decision on whether to wave through its Australia Pacific LNG proposal to late February. That decision puts Santos in second place. The fourth contender, Shell and its partner PetroChina, is running perhaps two years behind the other three, given that PetroChina
no doubt has a good idea of when its marketing muscle will best be brought to bear to underpin its and Shell's plans.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"While Santos's protracted deal with Korea Gas over the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project is looking increasingly certain, another deal faces an increasingly tough timetable if it is not to fall away.
The Korean energy ministry reportedly issued a statement yesterday saying it would take a 15 per cent stake in GLNG and commit to a huge offtake contract of 3.5 million tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years.
 Finally securing the deal will dramatically increase the odds of Santos launching its $1 billion-plus capital raising as soon as it approves GLNG. The market has been hanging out for a buyer of Kogas's calibre to join the project, and will be far more willing to back another Santos equity raising as a result.
While GLNG looks rosy, the situation over at Santos's Evans Shoal project in the Bonaparte Basin is more murky.
Santos agreed in March to sell its 40 per cent stake in Evans Shoal to US company Magellan Petroleum for $100Â million upfront and a further $100 million in milestone payments.
To complete the transaction Magellan must pay $85 million to Santos by Christmas Day â€“ now just six business days away.
At the end of the September quarter, Magellan had $US36.5 million in cash to its name, well short of the funding required. Given nine months have passed since the original deal was struck, it seems Magellan has not had the easiest time raising cash for the deal.
Most recently, Magellan has flagged a deal by which its major shareholder, the Luxembourg-based Young Energy Prize, will enter the project and stump up the bulk of the outstanding funding.
It is understood the entry of YEP, which is controlled by Russian entrepreneur Nikolay Bogachev, requires the approval of the other partners in Evans Shoal â€“ namely Royal Dutch Shell, Petronas and Osaka Gas.
Getting one oil major to approve something quickly is one thing, getting three to do so is another thing all together,
Either way, it looks a tight run towards that Christmas Day cheque.
Meanwhile, Karoon Gas Australia and its partner in the Poseidon gas discovery, US major ConocoPhillips, look set to announce today they have locked in one of the biggest drilling contracts in Australia in recent times.
The pair are poised to secure a rig to drill at least five wells at Poseidon next year, plus an option to drill up to another two.
At around $100 million a well, the program could ultimately be worth up to $700 million.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The drawn-out nature of the Santos-Kogas process â€“ while frustrating â€“ should not take too much lustre off a deal that will represent a remarkable moment in Santos' history.
The deal will massively reduce the risk of the Gladstone Liquified Natural Gas project by providing the bona-fide LNG buyer the market has craved.
 It shores up buyers for all LNG from its first two trains and reduces Santos's share of the project's $18 billion capex.
It should answer many of the questions that have hovered over whether Santos â€“ a company with no experience in operating LNG and a minor player by global oil and gas standards â€“ could successfully pull off a project of GLNG's size.
Petronas, Total and now Kogas will be an exceptionally strong group of partners to aid Santos in constructing what will be only the world's second coal seam gas-fed LNG project.
The Kogas offtake commitment is huge and will rank as one of the largest trade deals in Australia's history, its worth to be measured in the tens of billions of dollars.
Santos chief executive David Knox can claim a major achievement.
"
AGEE,The Age,2010,4,"SANTOS is expected to proceed with two liquefied natural gas trains for its $16.1 billion Gladstone LNG project next month after securing an offtake agreement and equity sales.
The Adelaide-based company will also undertake a fully underwritten institutional share placement of almost 40 million shares at $12.55 to raise $500 million to fund its $4.8 billion share of the project.
 That stake has been reduced to 30 per cent after it sold 7.5 per cent to Korea Gas (KOGAS) and 7.5 per cent to France's Total for $665 million. It means Petronas will have 27.5 per cent of GLNG, Total gets 27.5 per cent and KOGAS becomes the minor shareholder with 15 per cent.
Each of the LNG processing trains will have a nameplate capacity of 3.9 million tonnes a year, with train 1 set to provide 1.7 million tonnes a year for KOGAS and 1.8 million tonnes a year for Petronas. Train 2 will feed 1.8 million tonnes a year to KOGAS and 1.7 million tonnes a year to Petronas.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the LNG offtake agreements were worth more than $120 billion.
 I have been talking this year about doing one train now and the second train 12 months later. I am very pleased to announce that is not what we are doing, we are doing two trains upfront,  he said.
LNG exports are expected to begin in 2015, generating $6 billion a year in average gross revenue, with construction to begin in the first quarter of 2011. The headline $16 billion includes $2 billion in contingencies.
Bechtel will build the two LNG trains, Italy's Saipem the gas transmission pipeline and Fluor the upstream service facilities.
Santos has been forced to slash dividends to help pay for the project. Shareholders are expected to get a final dividend for the year ended December 31 of 15Â¢ a share, down from 20Â¢ a year earlier. It also plans to introduce a 2.5 per cent discount on its dividend reinvestment plan.
Santos shares are expected to exit a trading halt on Monday with the settlement of the institutional placement to take place on Thursday.
Standard & Poor's analyst May Zhong placed Santos on CreditWatch negative given the large capital investment in GLNG.
 We consider the GLNG development as significantly transformational for the underlying business and financial profiles for Santos,  Ms Zhong said.  This transformation reflects, in our view, not only the relative size of the GLNG development relative to Santos's existing base business but also the level of complexity in designing, constructing, contracting, commissioning, resource conversion, and integrated logistical management required of up to five years for the development.

GCBULL,The Gold Coast Bulletin,2010,4,"SANTOS is poised to approve a $US16 billion ($A16.16 billion) two-train liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone in Queensland after signing a major offtake and equity deal with Korean company Kogas.
Santos had been planning to make a final investment decision on a one-train project initially, then look to approve the second train within 12 months.
 But the multibillion-dollar deal signed yesterday, for the supply of 3.5 million tonnes of LNG a year to Kogas, means the company will make a decision on two trains next month.
Santos has now contracted 7 million tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years.
Santos chief executive David Knox said the confidence the GLNG joint venture had to go ahead with the two-train proposal was a key message.
``The whole package we've done is an extremely powerful package,'' Mr Knox said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"LAST WORD
It was a huge week for the energy sector, starting with the Pythonesque completion of the $5.3 billion sale of selected NSW electricity assets and ending on Friday with Santos, led by David Knox, signing deals paving the way for the $US16 billion LNG coal seam gas project in Gladstone.
 Both were landmark transactions and both were sealed while an elephant was sitting in the room. The elephant, of course, was a carbon tax. The industry accepts that a tax on carbon will be imposed but, until decisions are made about the system for doing this, uncertainty will pervade the sector.
If that uncertainty is not removed within the next 12 months, leading industry players say investment in new energy-generation infrastructure will be affected, and that in turn will push up energy prices.
Australians are already paying the price for the investment required in recent years to replace ageing assets built between the 1950s and 1970s.
Electricity prices have surged by 12 per cent this year and by an average of 5 per cent a year for the past decade. Those are much higher growth rates in electricity prices than in six other developed economies analysed in a timely paper published by the Reserve Bank of Australia this week.
The RBA paper, which examines the surge in the price of utilities including water, says the increase in natural gas prices has been less severe than in several other developed countries but, at 9.8 per cent this year, the growth rate is more than double the inflation rate.
While the RBA concludes that the level of prices for household electricity and gas does not appear to be particularly high relative to other advanced economies, its ominous conclusion is that further large increases are anticipated in the years ahead.
Increased capital investment in energy infrastructure automatically passes through to consumers because, under the pricing model used by the Australian Energy Regulator, an increase in investment contributes to higher prices in the regulatory period.
Without going into the complexities of the regulatory pricing, suffice it to say that the estimated $12 billion expenditure on electricity networks planned for 2011 and 2012 will be passed on.
It is the same with the carbon price. Whatever system is devised by the Gillard government, it will be recovered from the market.
That brings us to the strategies pursued by leading companies in the industry to handle both the pressures of changing consumer energy use and the demands for lower carbon emissions.
It is fair to say Origin Energy is at the forefront of this strategic repositioning. It became the country's largest energy retailer this past week, with the purchase from the NSW government of Integral Energy and Country Energy and the electricity trading rights from Eraring power station, the country's biggest coal-fired power station.
Origin was attracted to the Eraring electricity trading rights because the Eraring power station is one of the most flexible power stations in Australia. It can operate efficiently even if it is functioning at only a third of its total output.
This flexibility is particularly important in a market where the changing habits of consumers have led to a fundamental shift in power usage.
As the RBA paper points out, there is huge growth in electricity in Australia at peak times, as more and more Australians use air conditioners on the hottest days and heaters on the coldest days.
Companies such as Origin are being forced to have the capacity to handle the surges in peak periods, even though the extra capacity is idle during non-peak periods. The RBA paper says growth in peak demand is expected to outpace growth in overall electricity consumption, which implies that additional costs involved in expanding capacity will not be matched by increased sales overall, leading to higher prices per unit of electricity sold.
This environment for energy consumption, combined with the pressure to reduce carbon consumption, has meant that the flexibility is a paramount consideration for energy producers.
Origin's strategy has been to focus on gas-fired power stations in the recognition that gas is the intermediate fuel that will help the transition from coal-fired power through to renewable energy.
Depending on the configuration of a gas-fired power station, it can produce up to 50 or 60 per cent less carbon than a coal-fired plant. On average, a gas-fired power station produces 30 per cent less carbon than a coal-fired plant.
Gas-fired power stations can be started up in minutes, as opposed to days to get a coal-fired plant from scratch to full capacity.
Whatever carbon tax system is introduced in Australia, it seems clear that gas will play an increasingly important role in reducing the carbon intensity of Australia's power output. The average carbon intensity of Australian energy production is currently about 0.92 tonnes of carbon per megawatt-hour of electricity.
It is clear to companies like Origin that, in order to encourage lower carbon output, the carbon tax system will have to provide incentives for the carbon-intensive power stations such as those in Victoria to run less and the gas-fired plants to run more.
The shift towards gas as the intermediate fuel was recognised in recent forecasts issued by the International Energy Agency in Paris in its World Energy Outlook 2010.
It raised the question as to whether gas was entering a golden age. It said natural gas was set to play a central role in meeting the world's energy needs for at least the next two-and-a-half decades.
The IEA has forecast that global natural gas demand, which fell in 2009 during the global financial crisis, will resume its upward trajectory from next year. It says demand will rise by 44 per cent between now and 2035.
Not surprisingly, China gas demand is tipped to grow fastest, accounting for more than one-fifth of the increase in global demand to 2035. On the flip side of the growing demand is a huge forecast increase in Middle East production. It is forecast to double its output by 2035.
More than a third of the surge in gas production will come from unconventional sources: shale gas, coal seam methane and tight gas.
Santos will be part of this growing supply chain now that it has completed all the elements required for a final investment decision.
On Friday, it executed binding agreements with Kogas and Total that will ensure the Gladstone LNG project goes ahead with two trains of gas supply and not the single train originally planned.
The final deal to get the $US16 billion GLNG project over the line involved the sale by GLNG of 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG to Kogas; the sale by Santos of an aggregate 15 per cent interest in GLNG to Total and Kogas for $665 million; and an aligned GLNG joint venture comprising Santos, Petronas, Total and Kogas.
Getting Kogas on board is significant because it's the world's largest LNG customer.
The final ownership structure of GLNG is Santos 30 per cent; Petronas 27.5 per cent; Total 27.5 per cent; and Kogas 15 per cent.
The deal included a $500 million share placement by Santos at $12.55 a share. Also, Santos shareholders have been told they will have to suffer a reduction in dividend payments to help cover the cost of Santos's capital expenditure contribution to the project of $US4.8 billion.
But shareholders will take heart from market reports that the GLNG project will deliver shareholders significant value over time. Mark Greenwood at Citigroup says the market is undervaluing GLNG.
He says the fact that Total was willing to pay $650 million for a 15 per cent share in GLNG shows the French company was willing to attribute a value to the project that is not recognised in the Santos share price.
 Our unrisked valuation for Santos including a two-train GLNG development is $17.47 a share, which provides 34 per cent upside relative to where it is currently trading,  Greenwood said in a note to clients on Friday. In other words, the price at which the stock was trading on Friday gave shareholders a free option on both the GLNG project and the Santos interest in an LNG project in Papua New Guinea.
One aspect of the Santos GLNG project that should provide some comfort to Australian householders concerned about the price of energy is the foreign buyers of the LNG produced in Gladstone will be paying $US8 a gigajoule. Compare that to the price paid in the Australian market for gas of about $3 to $4 a gigajoule. Another way to look at that dramatic difference in the price of gas between Australian households and those in Asia is that we are living in an artificial energy bubble which cannot last.
The treasurers and chief financial officers at Australia's big banks breathed a big sigh of relief on Friday following the release of a joint statement from the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on the new bank liquidity rules.
Essentially, the banks will be able to go to the doors of the Reserve Bank and get the liquidity they need to meet the new liquidity coverage ratio for a fee. At least they know that there is a relatively simple and elegant solution to the problem of Australia not having enough government bonds to be held as liquidity under the new standard.
The solution means our banks won't be held back from filling their role as key intermediators between borrowers and depositors. The big unknown is how analysts, investors and depositors will react when a bank uses the RBA facility and shows it in its balance sheet. It is hoped that using the facility will not be seen as a sign of danger.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"A breakthrough $US60 billion deal with the world's largest buyer of liquefied natural gas will allow Santos to speed up a doubling of capacity at its landmark $US16 billion Gladstone LNG project in Queensland.
Santos on Friday confirmed its Gladstone joint venture had committed to sell 3.5 million tonnes a year for 20 years to Korea Gas, all but selling out projected production from the project's first two trains, or processing lines.
 Santos will, as part of the deal, sell Kogas and its existing Gladstone partner, Total of France, a 15 per cent equity stake in the project for $655 million.
The deal ensures Gladstone will be the second coal seam gas-fed LNG project to be approved for development, behind BG Group's $US15 billion Queensland Curtis project approved in October.
Combined with an earlier agreement to sell 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG to Malaysian giant Petronas, the project has now secured buyers for LNG worth about $US120 billion. Santos and its partners plan to approve the development of Gladstone as a two-train development, rather than a single-train project, with a final investment decision delayed by a month until the end of January.
The second train is set to improve Gladstone's economics by leveraging off infrastructure built to support the first train.
Santos also announced it would shore up its finances for the project's construction through a $500 million placement at $12.55 â€“ a 1.2 per cent discount to its average share price the past week.
Santos chief executive David Knox said Gladstone was now  well and truly ready to go .
 We've underpinned a two-train project, that's the absolute key thing we've done today,  Mr Knox said from Seoul on Friday.
 We've got a very strong set of partners, we've got 7 million tonnes of LNG sold, and we've moved the project towards [a final investment decision] in January, which allows us to deliver this. That's a whole new investment. 
Santos provided new detail about Gladstone's projected capital costs, and the project's $US16 billion forecast budget will come in slightly below analysts' expectations.
That figure includes $US2 billion in contingencies, with much of the project's cost locked into fixed price contracts.
The company said it expected the overall rate of return from Gladstone to be between 11 and 14Â per cent.
Macquarie Research analyst Adrian Wood said Kogas would make a  fantastic  addition to Gladstone.
 Without Kogas they were looking to sanction one train now and one later,  Mr Wood said.
 That would have meant an awkward conversation with shareholders about raising money for a second train they hadn't yet committed to, but would also have exposed what are some fairly marginal economics on the first train as a stand-alone project. Now with Kogas in we're looking at a two-train project, and that massively de-risks the whole thing,  he said.
Deutsche Bank advised Santos on the Kogas transaction, while JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley will carry out the placement.
On top of Santos's equity stake sales, Petronas will sell another 7.5 per cent share of Gladstone to Kogas.
That will leave the joint venture consisting of Santos with 30 per cent, Petronas and Total with 27.5Â per cent, and Kogas 15 per cent.
The project's nameplate capacity will also increase from 7.2 million tonnes a year to 7.8Â million tonnes.
Santos shares were at $12.97 before they entered a trading halt on Friday.
KEY POINTS
The Gladstone LNG output has been booked by Korea Gas.
The deal is for 3.5 million tonnes a year for 20 years.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2010,4,"COAL SYDNEY, Dec 19 AAP - New rules governing coal seam gas exploration in NSW have come too late for residents of inner-Sydney St Peters, where drilling has already been approved.
About 100 campaigners, including residents and farmers, rallied near the St Peters drilling site on Sunday to protest against the revised legislation which they claim fails to protect agricultural land and aquifers.
 The action coincided with the NSW government's introduction of  more rigorous  community consultation and  tighter  environmental controls for new drilling applications.
 The reality is natural gas is an important part of cleaner and more sustainable energy sources into the future,  Premier Kristina Keneally said in a statement issued on Sunday.
 However, it is important to get the balance right: managing our natural resources in an environmentally responsible way, with extensive community consultation, while moving the industry forward to a cleaner source of power. 
The updated rules require that exploration proposals be considered by four state departments and that the government also examine banning the use of chemicals at sites where they could threaten groundwater purity.
Greens MP David Shoebridge, who joined Sunday's St Peters protest, said the changed laws don't go far enough.
 This package falls a long way short of giving the DECCW (Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water) the concurrent approval power that farmers and environmentalists have been calling for,  Mr Shoebridge said.
Planning Minister Tony Kelly on Sunday praised the  tough new rules  for coal seam gas exploration but admitted they came too late for the St Peters drill.
 It is too late for the (site) at St Peters, it was granted in 2008,  Mr Kelly said of the updated approval system.
The NSW opposition welcomed the changed laws but said its implementation has taken too long and that there is more needs to be done.

 Applicants will now also have to provide details on any expected environmental impacts to the Planning and Environment Departments before drilling starts.
Hunter Valley Protection Alliance chief Executive John Thomson says the new rules are a step in the right direction.
 It was absolutely gobsmacking to us when we found out that the industry wasn't covered under the Environment Act and the department had no oversight of the industry whatsoever,  he said.
 How could you imagine an industry of this scale not being subject to the Environment Act?
 So yes it's a good step in the right direction, but boy, we've got a lot of work to do to get this properly managed and regulated.
 Fundamentally what we need is a strong strategic plan that really looks at all the impacts of the industry that says there's a right place and wrong place for these industries.
 So then communities aren't going to have to spend the rest of their lives going through these very detailed documents trying to make sense of it and then trying to understand where it's appropriate for their area or not.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,4,"WITH the election fast approaching, the NSW Government yesterday moved to limit the ongoing controversy surrounding coal seam gas drilling in the state, announcing a raft of new rules designed to give communities more say before projects are approved.
Under the changes exploration companies must submit plans, detailing environmental impacts and chemicals to be used before work commences.
 Companies must also provide detailed information about their activities to all affected councils and landowners and establish a community information hotline.
The move comes after a campaign for a moratorium was launched by the NSW Farmers Association and backed by the Australian Greens, and as recently as last week, Lismore City Council.
â€œWe recognise community concerns about coal seam gas exploration â€“ and we are listening to them,â€? Premier Kristina Keneally said in a statement.
â€œHowever, it is important to get the balance right managing our natural resources in an environmentally responsible way, with extensive community consultation â€“ while moving the industry forward to a cleaner source of power.â€?
She said the Government would consider banning the controversial BTEX chemicals which had already been outlawed in Queensland after trace elements were found during drilling at Arrow Energy's Surat Basin.
Exploration plans will be scrutinised by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW) and the Department of Planning and Industry & Investment NSW.
Primary Industries minister Steve Whan said while the gas was an important future energy source for the state, it was important its development didn't go unchecked.
â€œThe involvement of DECCW in the exploration licence process will ensure that both short term and long term environmental impacts are taken into account.â€?

ILM,Illawarra Mercury,2010,4,"THE State Government yesterday announced new rules giving residents more say in coal seam gas exploration in a bid to quell community fears over environmental impacts.
Companies now will be required to submit work plans detailing environmental effects before any gas drilling takes place.
 Details of drilling, chemical use and hydraulic fracturing, or  fracking  will be taken into account before licences are granted.
The Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, the Department of Planning, and Industry and Investment NSW will all be brought into the exploration licence process.
Community involvement will be strengthened, with applicants required to detail their activities to councils and landholders, establish an inquiry hotline and distribute information on landholder rights.
In September this year, northern suburbs residents claimed they were being kept in the dark about plans to extract methane gas from coal seams between Helensburgh and Coledale and also expressed concerns about the potential risks of fracking.
Meantime, tension is escalating over coal mining in the Southern Highlands as landowners are approached by company representatives about drilling on their land.
The village of Sutton Forest is the centre of a growing battle over plans for an underground coalmine which would likely dig under some of the area's most expensive mansions.
In the past week some residents of Golden Vale Rd at Sutton Forest have been approached by mining company Anglo American, for talks about exploratory drilling on their land.
One of the residents, who did not want to be named, said Anglo's regional manager of external affairs Aldo Pennini called him on Thursday and tried to arrange a face-to-face meeting to discuss drilling on his land.
The resident, whose family has owned the land for decades, said no.
 They were very polite, there were no strong-arm tactics,  he said.
 I politely declined because I don't want to be living on or near a coalmine. 
The Mercury yesterday asked Anglo American and Mr Pennini about the approaches but the company declined to comment.
A consortium including Australian miner Cockatoo Coal and Korean steel company POSCO wants to buy the mining lease from Anglo American.
The group opposed to mining, the Southern Highlands Coal Action Group, is escalating its campaign against the mine plans.
The group's convener Peter Martin said Anglo was trying to fulfil work requirements before the sale, drilling to ascertain the quality of coal seam and the extent of the coal.
 We've had calls from a number of landowners, all of which have told them to go away,  he said.
 I've spoken to them on the telephone and advised them we're going to be resisting what they're doing very vigorously.
 It's the thin end of the wedge. History's shown once you allow coal companies to start exploration drilling, it makes it a lot easier for them to get regulatory approval for mining. 
Mr Martin said the group had more than 2000 members. He said up to 450 new members signed up in the past two weeks at Bowral markets and at a screening of the documentary Gasland in Bowral, which filled the Empire Cinema's theatre.
So far there has been no comment from the most famous landowners on Golden Vale Rd, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban.
They appeared on the Oprah television specials in Sydney, but do not appear to have visited their Sutton Forest property.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2010,4,"THE use of toxic chemicals in the exploration and extraction of coal seam gas is likely to be banned in NSW, following pressure from environment groups and a similar decision by the Queensland government.
The chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, collectively referred to as BTEX, are commonly used in the controversial  fracking  or hydraulic fracturing process for extracting coal seam gas.
 Fracking injects a mixture of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rock formations to fracture them and release the gas. But there are concerns about the possible contamination of drinking water as a result.
Announcing new rules for coal seam gas exploration in NSW, Planning Minister Tony Kelly said he expected the state government's coal exploration strategy would be brought before cabinet on February 1. The question of whether to ban BTEX is also expected to be discussed.
 What we really need to determine in the future is the use of some of the chemicals used, like BTEX for example,  Mr Kelly said.
Opposition industry spokesman Duncan Gay said the Coalition supported a ban on the use of BTEX in coal seam gas exploration and extraction and had been calling for it for two months.
The new rules for coal seam gas exploration and extraction mean that assessment of a mining company's application for a licence will no longer solely be carried out by the Department of Industry and Investment.
All future applications for coal seam exploration will need to contain a review of possible environmental effects.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"The forgotten player of Queensland's gas boom, Perth-based Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd, could be just weeks away from a deal that gets it back in the game.
Having licked its wounds after Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina took over Arrow Energy, which deprived LNG Ltd of a source of gas for its Fisherman's Landing project at Gladstone, the company has got back on with the task of finding new partners.
 LNG Ltd is believed to be confident of securing a fairly Â­Â­high-profile partner interested in the company's unique LNG technology, which should go a long way to bolstering the credibility of both the company and its LNG process.
The new partner, which should be announced by mid-January, won't extend to Fisherman's Landing as such, but could bring the clout to facilitate the deals the project needs to get back on track.
The preferred partner, which is not already active in Australia, is one of several European and Asian groups to have approached LNGâ€ŠLtd since Arrow was taken over.
On the gas supply side, LNG Ltd has already decided to investigate the option of piping gas from Metgasco's northern NSW fields to Fisherman's Landing.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"An ongoing legal dispute between Burrup Fertilisers and its natural gas supplier is adding another layer of uncertainty for potential buyers of the beleaguered ammonia producer on Western Australia's Burrup Peninsula.
Burrup and the Apache-led Harriet Joint Venture have been wrangling since 2006 over the venture's capacity to continue a cheap 25-year gas supply contract inked in late 2001.
 The Indian-owned company's success in securing a long-term gas supply at a rock-bottom price believed to be as low as $US1 per gigajoule, several times below current market prices, was originally a key ingredient in its success in developing one of the world's biggest ammonia plants near Karratha.
But the Harriet JV partners, which include Kuwait's Kufpec and Tap Oil, declared force majeure on the contract in 2006, only about a year after starting delivering the gas. They cited the failure of exploration wells that meant they could not guarantee reserves sufficient to meet the full length of the contract. Burrup disputed the ability of the partners to avoid their contractual obligations.
The Harriet JV is continuing supplies to the ammonia venture, but Tap has warned supplies could last only another four or five years.
The contract was for the supply of 80 terajoules a day of gas for 25 years.
Tap, a 12.22 per cent partner in the Harriet JV, last year applied in the WA Supreme Court for a declaration to try to limit damages for a potential failure to supply the gas to Burrup Fertilisers to liquidated damages under the gas supply contract. That would amount to $US20 million to $US25 million in total for Tap, spread from about 2013 to 2030.
The court was expected to hear the trial in late 2010 or in 2011.
Apache's Australian subsidiary declined to comment yesterday on the process, but Tap advised that Burrup is continuing to take delivery of gas at the usual daily rates and is up-to-date with its monthly payments under the contract.
It said it had yet to assess the implications of Burrup Fertilisers' receivership but said it had  no material credit risk exposure.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"Santos's landmark deal with energy giant Korea Gas looks to have spelt an end to any short-term collaboration between Santos and other players in Queensland's coal seam gas sector.
Santos last Friday announced it had locked in a deal to sell Kogas about $US60 billion worth of output from the Santos-led Gladstone liquefied natural gas project over 20 years.
 The deal, which includes Kogas buying a 15 per cent stake in the project, effectively sells out production from GLNG's first two trains (or processing lines).
It will also allow Santos and its partners to approve the project as an initial two-train development, compared with the initial one train the partners had been contemplating.
Speaking to The Australian Financial Review, chief executive David Knox said the partners in GLNG (Santos, Kogas, Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total) were firmly focused on executing the GLNG development, with thoughts of consolidation and collaboration with other parties on the back burner.
 The key thing here is the partnership right now is absolutely focused on getting the [final investment] decision done. The second thing we're going to be focused on is delivery and making sure we get that absolutely right,  Mr Knox said.  Then we'll look to the future when we're more confident of where we are. 
Santos's difficulties in sealing the Kogas deal coupled with concerns over whether GLNG had sufficient gas reserves to cover two trains meant Santos had long been tipped as one of the Queensland coal seam gas companies most likely to collaborate with the state's less advanced projects.
Santos is known to have held detailed discussions with Royal Dutch Shell over potential collaboration earlier this year.
The Kogas deal, coupled with a substantial upgrade to the project's gas reserves, has reduced the rationale for collaboration in the short term.
The GLNG venture's site on Curtis Island is considered one of the island's best, and has space for up to five LNG trains.
Mr Knox also said he was confident the company would avoid the kinds of cost blowouts that have marred LNG developments worldwide â€“ and most recently Woodside Petroleum's $14 billion Pluto project in Western Australia â€“ due to the use of fixed-price contracts for most of the project's big contracts.
The contractor for two trains, Bechtel, and pipeline company Seipem have agreed to fixed-price contracts, while engineering, procurement and construction contractor Fluor has a majority fixed contract.
With several LNG projects now in construction in the region, labour and equipment costs are tipped to rise.  We've shielded ourselves from that [cost pressure] by having fixed price contracts. That was a deliberate strategy,  Mr Knox said.
 In a fixed-price contract, you potentially have to pay a little bit more to achieve a locked-in sum and that's what we've done. 
Santos yesterday completed its $500 million institutional placement at $12.55 a share. Santos shares, which resumed trading for the first time since the Kogas deal was announced, closed up 53Â¢ at $13.50.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2010,4,"ARGUS REPORT - Gas
The coal-seam gas industry's concerns that it will face an unfair disadvantage compared with its offshore competitors under the proposed resource tax regime seemâ€Šâ€Što have been only slightly assuaged.
 Coal-seam gas producers such as Santos, Origin Energy and BGâ€ŠGroup met with the Policy Transition Group (PTG) in early November to outline their problems with the government's plan to impose a tax on them similar to the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT), which now covers offshore oil and gas companies.
The tax, which has existed since 1987, is being extended to onshore oil and gas projects, including Queensland's burgeoning coal-seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry.
Unlike conventional offshore oil and gas projects, where the tax applies once the operations are profitable, the coal-seam gas companies are concerned that they will be liable to pay state royalties as soon as they start production and then the PRRT at a later date.
Although those royalties will be refundable, they will still need to be paid initially, creating a new layer of administration and expense for the onshore industry that does not apply to offshore companies such as Woodside Petroleum.
 There will still be that double hit for a period,  said Teresa Dyson, a tax partner at Blake Dawson.  They've proposed that there'll be full refundability of royalties but that there should be measures that ensure that the states and territories don't have any incentive to increase their royalties. 
Santos, Origin and BG all declined to comment yesterday while the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association said it still held  a number of concerns with the long-term impact  of the resource taxation reforms. The industry lobby group did add, however, that it was cautiously optimistic that the recommendations provided a foundation for the next stage of discussions with the government.
But unconventional oil and gas projects, including coal-seam gas, should benefit from an expected difference in the definition of exploration versus conventional projects, the PTG proposed. That would allow more generous deductions for exploration expenditure, which would be offset against taxable receipts.
Some sub-sectors of the unconventional oil and gas industry also had a small victory, as underground coal gasification and the extraction of coalmine methane when integrated into a coalmining operation were both recommended for inclusion under the more favourable minerals resource rent tax regime, instead of the PRRT.
Junior oil and gas explorers were unsuccessful, however, in their bid for a $50 million threshold to be introduced before the PRRT applies, similar to that proposed for the MRRT. As a result, small oil and gas companies will feel the effects of the new tax much earlier than will their mining counterparts.
 That differential in the tax rate as well as the threshold that applies for MRRT and not for PRRT will still be a sticking point for industry,  Blake Dawson's Msâ€ŠDyson said.
APPEA chief executive Belinda Robinson said it was regrettable that while the case for supporting the junior sector was acknowledged, the PTG sought to defer further consideration of measures to assist smaller explorers.

 Argus report offers sweeteners Labor faces state royalties battle
The federal government is set for a showdown with the states after its Â­mining tax advisory panel recommended crediting all current and future state royalties against the planned $7.4 billion tax.
A detailed report by the Policy Transition Group, co-chaired by Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and former BHP Billiton chairman Don Argus, said the federal government should put in place arrangements so there was no incentive for states to increase royalties on coal, iron ore and gas projects.
The report released yesterday recommended concessions such as a gradual phase-in of the tax for small miners earning between $50 million and $100 million, and adjusting the taxing point to assist the magnetite industry. But in a blow to junior Â­miners, it found no compelling case to give tax incentives for exploration.
Despite the PTG report's concessions being cautiously welcomed by major miners, West Australian Premier Colin Barnett called on Prime Minister Julia Gillard to dump  the dog  of a tax.
The federal government has not yet decided which of the recommendations it will accept; Treasurer Wayne Swan said he would respond to theÂ report early next year after Â­consideration by cabinet and talks with state leaders.
 There is a lot of common sense in this report,  Mr Swan said.  There will be further conversations that will need to be had with cabinet colleagues first and foremost, but also the resources sector [and] the states, before we respond formally. 
A major point of contention has been whether the federal government would credit future royalty increases. The original agreement between the government, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, signed last July, said  all  royalties would be credited. The government has since argued that crediting future royalty increases would give a  green light  for the states to increase royalties  willy-nilly  and leave the commonwealth to foot the bill.
The industry says if the commonwealth does not credit any future royalty increases, this could lead to double taxation.
Mr Swan said yesterday he had  dozens  of mechanisms to deter the states from raising royalties, but said he would not pre-empt discussions. Those mechanisms are understood to include withholding federal payments to the mining states if they raised Â­royalties.
The PTG report, released by Mr Swan and Mr Ferguson in Canberra yesterday, was broadly welcomed by major miners, but opposed by smaller companies.
Rio Tinto's managing director Australia, David Peever, said it was an important step towards ensuring that the key principles in the heads of agreement between the companies and the government entered into in July were carried through into the minerals resource rent tax (MRRT) legislation.
 It is fundamentally important that Australia's future resources taxation regime remains competitive when the MRRT is implemented,  he said. He was pleased the Argus committee had recommended that all current and future state royalties be creditable against MRRT liabilities.
The 175-page document says that to preserve Australia's international competitiveness, there should be full crediting of all current and future state royalties under the MRRT so as to provide certainty about the overall tax impost on the coal and iron ore mining industries.
 Equally, the MRRT should not be used as a mechanism to enable states and territories to increase inefficient royalties on MRRT taxable commodities,  the Argus report says.
 Accordingly, the [Argus committee] also recommends the Australian, state and territory governments put in place arrangements to ensure that state and territory governments do not have an incentive to increase royalties on coal and iron ore. This would limit their negative impacts, while allowing the Australian government's taxation regime to maximise the return to the community during the high point of the resources cycle, so achieving the balanced outcome described above. 
Mr Swan said the royalties issue would be discussed with the states, including at the Council of Australian Governments, which is scheduled to meet in February in Canberra.
But Mr Barnett was resolute yesterday and sent Mr Swan and Ms Gillard a Christmas message.  This tax proposal is a complete shambles,  he said.  My advice to Julia Gillard is have a nice Christmas, a Happy New Year, sit down quietly and think about it and realise this tax proposal is a dog and just get rid of it.
 We will not allow the commonwealth to impose any restrictions on the way in which we collect royalties from the mining industry.  States can increase royalties if they choose to, that is their constitutional right. The federal government could only withhold GST if the states agree to that, and Western Australia will not agree to handing over GST revenues to the commonwealth. 
The Argus report says Treasury has advised that the measures identified in the report would, when taken together, be  broadly fiscal neutral  over the next four years.  Some of the recommendations involve fiscal cost, while others involve a fiscal gain,  it says.
The Argus committee was established to review the details of the mining tax after Labor's peace deal with the major miners earlier this year. Under the deal, which applies only to coal and iron ore, miners will pay an effective tax rate of 22.5 per cent on the value of their commodities under the new minerals tax. The rate was watered down from 40 per cent after then prime minister Kevin Rudd was deposed.
The Argus report contains 94 recommendations on the planned MRRT on coal and iron ore, and on the extended petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) that will be applied to onshore oil and gas projects from mid-2012.
The recommendations include technical issues concerning project taxing points, deductible expenses, transfer of losses, the value of project-starting bases transitioned into the regime, and administrative compliance. Mr Swan indicated the government was likely to adopt the proposal to establish a tax implementation group, comprising experts from industry and the tax profession, and officials from Treasury, the Tax Office, and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.
The Minerals Council of Australia said the Argus committee had  ended  the debate over the crediting of all state and royalties,  by upholding the spirit and letter of the heads of agreement on the tax .
The MCA welcomed most of the key design details proposed but said there were some technical areas where the Argus report was not in line with industry expectations.
These include the indexation of some deductions at the inflation rate instead of the original 13 per cent, subjecting inventory as of July 2012 to the tax, limiting transferability of losses between coal and iron ore projects, and treating starting bases for petroleum projects under the PRRT differently from the MRRT.
Association of Mining and Exploration Companies chief executive Simon Bennison, who represents smaller miners and explorers, said the majority  completely oppose the additional tax on iron ore and coalminers. AMEC is also extremely disappointed that exploration development incentives will not be pursued at this time .
Opposition energy and resources spokesman Ian Macfarlane said the report showed how much work still had to be done to address the deep flaws in the tax.
 The report of the Policy Transition Group shows just how badly this government has bungled the MRRT,  Mr Macfarlane said.
 This is basic design and consultation work that should have been done months ago, before the tax was announced and hastily redrawn. From the very beginning, the government's rushed and reckless tax grab has been badly handled.

The project worth an initial $16.15billion, will utilise coal seam gas extracted from the company's reserves throughout Queensland including the Surat Basin region.
 The CSG will be transported via a 420km underground pipeline to the LNG facility on Curtis Island near Gladstone.
The two LNG processing trains will have an expected 7.8 million tonnes per annum capacity.
On Friday, Santos signed agreements for the sale of GLNG of 3.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG to KOGAS.
Santos also agreed to sell an aggregated 15 per cent interest in GLNG to Total and KOGAS for $665million as well as completing an aligned GLNG joint venture which comprises of Santos, PETRONAS, Total and KOGAS.
Once the KOGAS and Total sale transactions are completed, the ownership structure of GLNG will be Santos 30%, PETRONAS 27.5%, Total 27.5% and KOGAS 15%.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"CALLS for the Queensland Government to address outstanding concerns about the lack of science and legislative controls surrounding negative impacts from coal seam gas production are growing louder following the release of a report highlighting the industry's risks to the environment.
A report issued by investment bank JP Morgan identifies extensive finan- cial risks associated with Queensland's emerging coal seam gas industry.
 Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton (pictured) said it was time for the State Government to start listening to com-munity voices calling for a moratorium on the industry.
 The report states there are so many environmental risks associated with the operation of coal seam gas that the government will need to change the rules along the way, and this could create great uncertainty for the companies and their markets,  Mr Hutton said.
The report was especially concerned about the cumulative impacts of all four CSG projects. These include greenhouse gas emissions and possible impacts on the Great Artesian Basin which, various expert studies have shown, could be damaged for centuries. Unexpected blow-out operating costs and compensation demands from affected landholders could also become serious financial issues.
Mr Hutton said when the community learned how irresponsible the State Government had been in allowing this industry to go ahead without full knowledge of its impacts, it would demand much more rigorous regulation.
This could drastically change the ground rules for the companies and cause cost blow-outs.
 The State Government is pursuing a very risky strategy for economic development by putting so much faith in this one fallible industry, and the LNP is supporting it every inch of the way,  Mr Hutton said.  Investment experts are urging caution and I am calling on Queensland's leaders to do the same.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Mid north coast politicians are under pressure to reject any plans for a coal seam gas industry in the region.
The Three Rivers Greens say a survey plane has been flying around Port Macquarie and the Hastings area, collecting data for a Sydney-based exploration company.
 The co-convenor, Ian Oxenford, says he wants the local MPs to support the Greens' no coal seam gas policy.
He says such plans would have devastating impacts in the region.
 This is an area of tourism and good healthy agriculture, off shore fishing,  he said.
 We don't want to see it become an industrial area.
 The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico should still be fresh on people's minds and this is the sort of thing that can go wrong of its off shore.
 If it's on shore, well then it's quite debilitating to agricultural land and just to general living. 
Mr Oxenford says the Greens want any plans for a coal seam gas industry in the region to be stopped.
He says such exploration would result in the 'pristine region' being turned into an industrial zone.
 There are many worries with coal seam gas,  he said.
 It produces some pretty dreadful toxins, it releases water out of the coal seam, not just gas, so it's quite different in its structure to natural gas.
 We'd like to see our politicians, Rob Oakeshott and Peter Besseling, come out and say this should be a no coal seam gas region.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2010,4,"Gas works
AN audit of Australia's energy resources highlighted the importance of Casino's gas reserves, when the Australian Energy Resource Assessment, prepared by two Federal Government agencies, was published in March. The report predicted that gas would outstrip coal as an energy provider by 2030, giving weight to the possibility that the gas-rich Casino and Woodenbong regions would become major gas hubs. At the end of 2009, The Northern Star had reported Sydney-based gas company Metgasco had discovered both conventional and coal seam gas at its Kingfisher site, near Casino, with the potential to power 30,000 homes for more than 650 years.
 Casino rail hub
WITH the discovery of gas and an era of newfound prosperity in sight, Casino was reported to be â€˜on a mission to raid the region of its industries and make itself the industrial hub of the Northern Rivers', wrote Northern Star journalist Mel McMillan. A development application was lodged with Richmond Valley Council to build a $12.7 million dollar rail terminal in the town. Throwing their weight behind the Summerdowns Rail Terminal proposal were The Northern Co-operative Meat Company, Riverina Stock Feeds, and Forest Enterprises Australia.
Nude Bike Ride
IN an original stunt to draw attention to the world's over-consumption of fossil fuels, about 20 riders staged a nude bike ride from Byron Bay Railway Station. A visitor from Victoria was heard to remark: â€˜You wouldn't see this in downtown Frankston'.
Steiner in strife
THE Shearwater Steiner School, at Mullumbimby, fell into the hands of administrators as it struggled amid a mountain of debt. The school's board appointed Mark Robinson and Stephen Parbery of PPB as administartors. Mr Robinson told shocked parents the school's board had brought the school's cash flow under control, but was unable to fix the â€˜debt overhang'. He said whether the school remained open would depend on the outcome of a creditors meeting, and at parents keeping their children at the school and continuing to pay fees. Recently (December 18-19, 2010) The Northern Star has reported that writs have been served on seven members of a committee which used to help run the school.
Body recovered
NEWS reached the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the body of talented young Byron Bay man Dylan Etherington had been found in Bosnia. Mr Etherington had been missing since diving from the historic Mostar Bridge on February 22 into the icy waters of the Neretva River in Bosnia-Herzegovina. His body was found by fishermen near the town of Mostar. Mr Etherington was a keen surfer and had recently completed a film on internationally renowned Byron band, Parkway Drive.
Rivafest scrapped
BALLINA Shire Council decided to scrap the popular Rivafest, which ran successfully for the past two years. The festival attracted more than 100,000 people in 2009. Councillors decided they couldn't justify spending $80,000 on the event annually.
Wategos fires
FIRE destroyed two multi-million dollar properties on Brownell Drive, Wategos Beach. Both houses were holiday lets. Tourists had left the first house only hours before the blaze began. Fire trucks from Byron Bay, Bangalow and Brunswick Heads attended and police evacuated nearby homes.
Shearwater woes
THE Shearwater Steiner School in Mullumbimby went into voluntary liquidation, with debts totalling more than $10 million. Unsecured creditors, including tradesmen and businesses, were owed about half of this amount.
SINGLE father Ashleigh Mackinnon, who accumulated huge medical debts trying to save the life of his wife Leah Chapman after she contracted breast cancer, resorted to desperate measures to save the family home. Mr Mackinnon put his $650,000 Wilsons Creek home up as the prize in a competition, with tickets selling at $100 each.
Blues Festival
BLUESFEST celebrated its 21st birthday with a new site at Tyagarah, big crowds and a great line up including Jeff beck, Jack Johnson, Crowded House and Angus and Julia Stone. The only hiccup was a problem with the ferris wheel, when one of the carriages fell, injuring several girls.
Metgasco
METGASCO announced plans to build a 140 kilometre pipeline from Casino to Ipswich to enable the export of coal seam gas to Asia and south-east Asia â€“ subject to approval. Managing director David Johnson said the export market demand for liquid natural gas was â€˜mind-boggling'.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2010,4,"Central Queensland coalmines have released potentially polluted water into the state's river systems, as flooding continues to halt work.
The Environment and Resource Management Department has reported that nine coalmines and two coal seam gas operations have released water  outside of their Environmental Authority conditions  recently.
 The huge amount of floodwater flowing through the state means that the harmful effect of any release of water from the mines should be mitigated.
Queensland Resources council chief executive officer Michael Roche says,  the environmental regulator has been strict but has been realistic about the situation. 
Flooding is causing millions of dollars of losses as means of transport such as railways and roads are closed, and the mines themselves are flooded.
There are estimated to be 45 coal-carrying vessels waiting offshore from the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal near Mackay, and QR National's Blackwater and Moura coal freight lines are also closed, cutting shipments from the Port of Gladstone.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2010,4,"S ince the industrial revolution began over two centuries ago, the oceans have absorbed an estimated 500billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is about a quarter of the total amount spewed into the atmosphere as the burning of coal, oil and natural gas gathered pace and agriculture replaced forests. As a result, the basic chemistry of seawater is being altered on a scale scientists say has not occurred for at least 20 million years. Moreover, it is happening at a rate not seen in the last 65 million years. Does it really matter? More specifically, will it affect future food security in a world where one billion people already rely on fisheries for their primary source of animal protein and another three billion depend on the sea to meet at least 15per cent of their protein needs? When carbon dioxide enters salt water, it makes the upper layer of the ocean more acidic. Since 1750, ocean acidity has increased by 30per cent.
 If we continue at this rate, it will record a 150per cent rise by the end of the century. In addition, as carbonic acid intensifies in seawater, calcium carbonate used by marine organisms to build shells, plates and skeletons, like coral reefs, is diluted. Global fish stocks are declining in many areas due to over-harvesting, marine pollution and habitat destruction. A study commissioned by the United Nations Environment Program and presented to the international climate change conference in Cancun, Mexico, earlier this month warned that fisheries face new threats from ocean acidification.
The study called for more extensive research on the impact this will have on catches of fin fish and shell fish, as well as fish farming. Aquaculture is the world's fastest- growing food source and last year
produced half of all the fish consumed by humans. It is seen as a panacea for dwindling wild fisheries. However, the fishmeal used in aquaculture comes from wild stock.
As the oceans acidify, marine scientists are observing another alarming trend, falling oxygen content. A study of the tropical ocean published earlier this year found that zones without enough oxygen for fish and other marine animals to survive expanded by 4.5million square kilometres between 1960 and 2008, an area about half the size of the United States. A lowered oxygen level can be a significant constraint on the growth of marine life because it takes a lot of energy to extract oxygen from water.
Daniel Pauly, a biologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada, predicts that the drop in the ocean's oxygen combined with
acidification will reduce the global fish catch by between 20 and 30per cent by 2050.
Tropical reefs provide shelter, food and breeding grounds for about 25per cent of fish species and account for as much as 12per cent of the global fish catch. These coral reefs are built from calcium carbonate over many centuries. Yet they are among the most vulnerable forms of marine life to more acid seas and warming waters. One of the most severe episodes of coral stress hit reefs in South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean earlier this year. It was the latest of several major episodes of mass bleaching over large reef areas in different parts of the world in the past 20 years. Since then, the number and frequency of these die-backs have increased. If the trend continues, it may disrupt the slow process of reef recovery.
There have been five mass extinctions in Earth's history and corals provide clues about what happened and why. They have been around for most of that time and they readily fossilise, thus providing a record.
Very little is known about the first mass extinction. But in the wake of the following four, reefs disappeared for millions of years long after adverse climatic conditions returned to benign levels.
Dr J. E. N. Veron, former chief scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science and author of numerous books on coral reefs, says that only a few decades ago he thought it ridiculous to imagine that reefs might have a limited lifespan as a consequence of human actions.
Today, he warns that if the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and sea continues to
rise, acidification will have a widespread impact by 2050. Different species of coral, coralline algae, plankton, and molluscs will show different tolerances, and their capacity to calcify will decline at different rates.
But, he wrote earlier this month, ''they will all suffer from some form of coralline osteoporosis. The result will be that corals will no longer be able to build reefs or maintain them against the forces of erosion.'' Veron added that what were once thriving coral gardens supporting the greatest biodiversity of the marine realm would become ''red-black bacterial slime, and they will stay that way''. His warning is a reminder that although the costs of action to curb carbon dioxide emissions may be high, the costs of inaction may be even higher.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2010,4,"THE State Government and the mining industry joined forces yesterday to allay pollution fears related to the release of water into central Queensland waterways by waterlogged mining operations.
Ten coal mines and two coal seam gas operations have released water outside their Environmental Authority conditions so far this month.
 The Government and the Queensland Resources Council yesterday said the risk of environmental harm ``is low''.
``Ongoing monitoring by the Department of Environment and Resource Management shows that water quality in the Fitzroy system remains high and is expected to continue to do so with the torrential rain flowing into the system,'' acting Climate Change and Sustainability Minister Andrew Fraser said.
QRC chief executive Michael Roche supported Mr Fraser in a separate media release in which he said some mines and gas operations had ``discharged water safely into strongly flowing local watercourses where it was not possible to manage such water on site'', in full consultation with DERM.
``We are talking about dilution factors akin to adding a thimbleful of water into a swimming pool,'' he said. However, the water releases were sharply criticised by Professor John Cole, a former State Environmental Protection agency senior bureaucrat and now the director of the University of Southern Queensland's Centre for Sustainable Business and Development.
``Mr Roche seems to think that a 1950s approach to pollution control, namely `dilution is the solution', is acceptable when bigger than expected flooding occurs,'' Prof Cole said.
``That is not acceptable environmental management and should not be condoned by the State Government.''

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"AS shadow minister for natural resources, mines and energy Jeff Seeney continues to draw condemnation from Queensland Country Life letter writers over his comments downplaying the impacts of coal seam gas production on agriculture, he is winning support from an unusual quarter | his direct political opponent.
Natural Resources, Mines and Energy Minister Stephen Robertson has been having a field day with the LNP's split over CSG in recent weeks, and last week issued a press release attacking the party's leadership for failing to reign in its warring elements over the issue.
 Mr Robertson singled out statements from shadow primary industries, fisheries and forestry spokesman Ray Hopper's recent Condamine electorate newsletter in which Mr Hopper expressed his  absolute disappointment  at Mr Seeney's com-ments in QCL, and stated that the views expressed by the Member for Callide were  Mr Seeney's personal opinion and not that of the broader LNP .
Mr Robertson said that in Parliament three weeks ago, Mr Hopper and the rest of the LNP members voted with the Bligh Government to support a motion endorsing the CSG industry and the Queensland Government's regulatory approach to the industry.
Mr Robertson said Mr Hopper had still not explained to his electorate why he voted to support the industry in Brisbane but constantly opposed it in his electorate, and called on the Member for Condamine to resign or for Opposition leader John- Paul Langbroek to take action and sack him.
Mr Robertson described Mr Seeney as  a proud man  who would not take Mr Hopper's attack lying down. Mr Seeney was  at times thoughtful , as evidenced by the recent QCL article.
 He should be asked for his response so that we all understand, once and for all, what the official LNP policy actually is. Is it Mr Seeney's version or is it the version of his more junior colleague, Hopper?  Mr Robertson said.
In response, Mr Hopper said Mr Robertson was just trying to confuse the public about the very real problems that face the CSG industry.
 The long-term Labor Government is hoping that all the questions people are asking, all the concerns they are raising, will just disappear. Minister Robertson should concentrate on legislating im-provements to the CSG industry rather than wasting time spinning political stor-ies. This issue is just too important.
 The State Labor Government's hand-ling of the CSG industry has been appal-ling at the very least. 
 It was my advocacy in Shadow Cabinet that led to the LNP's policy for the Protection of Prime Agricultural Land.
 The initiatives the LNP have announced like appropriately resourcing an independent Gasfields Land and Water Authority, regionally basing compliance staff, the CSG industry having to demonstrate they aren't adversely impacting upon the underground water and ensuring a fairer share of royalties back to the regions are examples of the work we have been doing to champion fairness and equity for all Queenslanders.
 I will continue to do all I can to ensure landholders' property rights, and the prime agricultural land they have been earning their living from for decades, are protected.
 I will continue to support them in their endeavours to guarantee we have land and water for generations to come to enable the continuation of food and fibre production for our nation.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2010,4,"Gasland is a movie about the US shale gas industry which, in a sense of guilt by association, has put Australia's coal seam gas industry in the spotlight since its first showing in Nov-ember.
Josh Fox, producer of Gas-land, has been the focus of much media attention and he has used it to promote the movie and his view of the US shale gas industry. He has also extrapolated events in Gasland, to represent what's ahead for Australia because the CSG in-dustry uses the same hydraulic fracture stimulation (HFS or fraccing) process used for shale gas in the US.
 Josh Fox's portrayal of HFS is central to his movie Gasland and it is the scapegoat for fau-cets on fire, dead creatures and something obscure about antelope migration. Now, anyone can google Gasland to see the various rebuttal/support web-sites, but I do think Josh's rep-resentation | and conse- quences | of HFS should itself be put under the spotlight.
The US shale gas industry probably puts down more gas wells every year than will occur in the whole of project life of our CSG to LNG projects. And to economically produce gas from shale it has to be fracked, so every US shale gas well will be subject to HFS. This is where the Gasland portrayal of HFS and its attributed environmental harm doesn't pass the common sense test. If the claims were accurate, then we wouldn't need a movie to tell us about them because the cumulative impact of all that fraccing would be both widespread and increasing in effect. In short, there would be so much methane (shale gas) leaking into the atmosphere it wouldn't be safe to light a cigarette in country areas in the US.
In CSG production, the purpose of HFS is to open up tight coal seams and allow gas to flow | it is a very targeted and controlled process so far used in some five percent of Queens-land CSG wells (but expected to increase to 10-40pc). Gasland does not detail the technology used to ensure HFS achieves its objective by extending the horizontal fracture along the coal seam and minimising the vertical fracture.
If there is insufficient separation distance between the HFS site and underlying/overlying aquifers it is possible to fracture into the aquifer. But this results in loss of gas and more water to remove and treat and both are unnecessary expenses to efficient gas prod-uction. Additionally, there is further cost in doing a cement squeeze to repair the poor HFS job and close off the aquifer. So, all up, there is a lot of financial incentive to get it right the first time.
Hydraulic fracturing start-ed some 60 years ago and like all technologies, be it agricultural chemicals or genetically modified cotton plants, all as-pects of it are continually being refined and improved. Con-trary to Gasland's portrayal, HFS is not shrouded in mys-tery nor is there secrecy about fraccing mixes. In fact detailed information is available on company websites and companies must provide detailed reports to the State Gov-ernment. The APPEA website has a full list of the chemicals potentially used in HFS of CSG wells | potentially, be-cause only some are added to each fracc mix. Indeed, some HFS is done with only two additives and technological advances may see the fraccing completely unnecessary.
So why would Josh Fox say that Gasland is a glimpse into what lies ahead for Queens-land and NSW? Fox is articulate and in my experience a decent enough bloke and good promoter of his work, but he has an agenda | and that is to stop the use of fossil fuels.
Fox is entitled to his view, but plenty of environmentalists concede gas has an important role in our energy future | domestically and internationally. Energy demand is rising and we all want to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
Natural gas, which is what CSG is, produces 40pc to 70pc less emissions than coal to generate electricity. Gas-fired plants can be switched on and off quickly | unlike coal-fired plants | so they are the perfect complement for wind and solar. Gasland is worth a watch, as it touches on some big questions facing our society.
Josh Fox tells an interesting story but he does not provide too many answers.

FTLAND,The Land,2010,4,"Santos, which is among 15 companies exploring and testing for coal seam gas (CSG) in NSW, says criticism of the industry is based on misconceptions.
Santos has interests in nine exploration licences in the Gunnedah Basin which cover about 22,000 square kilometres across the Gunnedah, Coonabarabran, Scone, Quirindi and Boggabri districts.
 Late this year it began pilot testing at two sites with well heads and surface installations on private land near Caroona and Mary's Mount, drilling up to 315 metres below the surface.
Santos spokesman, Sam Crafter, said CSG already accounted for about 80 per cent of Queensland's gas supply and the technology had been proven over 15 years, with present progress representing  an unparalleled economic opportunity that is expected to generate up to 18,000 jobs in Queensland.
He maintained that NSW had the potential to follow the same path.
Mr Crafter said the CSG industry was spending  many millions of dollars carrying out the studies and assessments required to deliver a safe and sustainable industry that can operate alongside landholders, and risks of adverse impacts on groundwater were  very unlikely .
Santos has partnerships with Australian Coalbed Methane and Macquarie Energy and in July, 2009, it acquired  significant additional acreage  and invested in CSG company Eastern Star Gas (ESG); combined permits between the two companies cover an area of about 63,000 square kilometres.
While Santos has NSW Government approval to explore for coal seam gas it has not yet applied for approval for commercial extraction of gas.

FTLAND,The Land,2010,4,"THE development of the Queensland coal seam gas (CSG) industry, gave Liverpool Plains conservation farmer, Donald Parish,  Booloolah , Mullaley, cause for concern.
His primary concern, shared by wife, Natasha, was what damage an Eastern Star Gas (ESG) pipeline through their cropping country could do
 The parishes (pictured) pointed to an incident at Coolah, just before Christmas, when heavy rain had exposed the Central Ranges Pipeline, which was more than three metres beneath the ground.
Mr Parish visited the Queensland gas fields to see what might happen at Gunnedah, and this only fuelled his fears.
 It's the cobweb effect ? as the industry expands, we expect more wells to be sunk and more roads formed to link it all,  he said.
ESG has proposed an easement 40 metres wide along the pipeline ? which would remove a substantial amount of land from agricultural production.
Mr Parish said the CSG industry was promoted as green and harmonious, but he had found it anything but in Queensland.
 It's not something that sits quietly in a paddock, there are large numbers of machinery and people,  he said.
While fracking ? pumping sand and fluids into the strata to facilitate extraction ? might be common practice elsewhere, Mr and Mrs Parish were adamant they did not want it on the Liverpool Plains.
 Eastern Star Gas has said it won't use this practice, but in some communiqujs this is unclear,  he said.
 We want some straight answers. 
? SAM NORRIS
 We don't know what damage putting 120 tonnes of sand down a hole into an aquifer might do,  he said.
 It's appalling and it's exactly why we are concerned about the pipeline through our private land,  Mrs Parish said.
 There are 400 truck movements between Chinchilla and the Dalby gas fields each day. 
A lack of clear communication from ESG had caused much concern.

FTLAND,The Land,2010,4,"ENERGY policy in Australia is in disarray with ambiguous signals from the Federal Government concerning a prospective carbon tax.
Government policy has already vastly devalued coal-fired power generators and market signals have recently encouraged a scramble for coal seam gas.
 If bipartisan political support emerges for nuclear power, the economics of energy and the government's energy agenda could change all over again and perhaps for the better at least for farming communities within the Surat Basin in Queensland.
After the development of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, the industrial revolution was the next major turning point in human history.
The revolution began with the transition from manual and draft-animal labor towards machine-based economies driven by new forms of energy.
In Australia today we should have plenty of both ? food and energy.
There are enormous energy reserves under the ground, but what is exploited, and what is used for domestic power generation, is as much about politics as market signals.
Coal is on the nose, nuclear a political hot potato, and a coal seam gas industry has sprung up in the Surat Basin and with it the potential for 40,000 wells that could threaten the ground waters of the Great Artesian Basin.
Some farm groups keen to stop the development of new mines and gas fields have employed environmental activists including Friends of the Earth campaigner, Drew Hutton, in their fight against the wells.
But this is very short sighted.
A major problem with professional activists is they are usually against everything and uninterested in distinguishing between responsible operators and vandals.
A better tactic for farm groups concerned about mining would be to take a more strategic approach, and an approach that is in the national interest ? not just their own interest.
There is pressure building within both the Liberal and Labor parties for a change of policy on the nuclear issue.
And it makes sense for agriculture.
Uranium reserves do not underlie prime agriculture land and nuclear power stations would be built by the sea and near major urban and industrial centres.
If farm leaders came out in support of nuclear power, the industry might at last be seen as more than totally self-serving with only a shallow interest in anything that doesn't involve food production.
And after all, into the future, a prosperous Australia will need not only quality food but also cheap, reliable base-load energy ? something uranium can provide.

FTLAND,The Land,2010,4,"KATIE and Scott Lloyd have 21 coal seam gas wells on their 3200-hectare cattle property,  Wieambilla , south-west of the Darling Downs town of Chinchilla in Queensland ? and are still struggling to come to terms with the situation.
Three are exploration wells and 18 are in production.
 When they were being established each well site took up about one hectare.
Within about five kilometres of their property there are about 165 such wells.
Coal seam gas (CSG) extraction is more advanced in Queensland than in NSW, but many NSW farmers could be in line for a similar experience to the Lloyds as exploration and gas extraction expands in this State.
CSG exploration licences cover large areas of NSW, from Woll- ongong to the Hunter Valley and stretching into the north-west slopes and plains.
One issue that has emerged in recent months in Queensland ? notably near Kingaroy and the Surat Basin (which includes Chinchilla) further west ? has been contamination of groundwater by carcinogenic chemicals and other contaminants, allegedly the result of the practice of  fracking .
This involves a fluid with water, sand and some additives being pumped down a well at high pressure to fracture the coal seam, to allow gas and water to escape.
The Queensland Government in July ordered coal gasification company, Cougar Energy, to suspend its operation at Kingaroy, because of contamination, but the company in mid-December reported tests from a monitoring bore had shown no detectable levels of the main chemicals of concern, benzene and toluene.
Cougar is conducting underground coal gasification (UCG) which is a very different process to extract gas from coal seams than CSG.
It said only one sample out of eight tested since early November had shown a trace of benzene.
Landholders in southern Queens- land earlier this year formed the Basin Sustainability Alliance as a focus for their concerns.
Alliance chairman, Ian Hayllor, said exploration companies were going  hell for leather , with plans afoot to expand the number of wells from about 4000 to 40,000 within 10 years.
He said the CSG industry expected to extract 350,000 megalitres of groundwater a year in the region.
 There is a question whether they have got the science or understanding of the long-term impacts on groundwater,  he said.
Mr Hayllor said various methods were being used to handle the saline water that came up with the gas, including evaporation ponds, re-injection of the water into the ground and, after desalination, diverting the water into the rivers.
 We are totally opposed to any water being exported out of the area,  he said.
Mr Hayllor said the Queensland Government's Strategic Cropping Zone plan to protect the best farming land from open-cut mining was of no help, because it did not cover CSG.
The Lloyds say two of the production wells on  Wieambilla  have been plugged and abandoned because they leaked gas.
Staff of the three companies involved ? Origin, QGC and Ian Sykes ? come on to the property virtually every day.
 During the development phase there was pretty horrific traffic,  Katie Lloyd said, and even though the companies were required to notify them of such visits, it was hard to adjust to the constant presence of strangers.
Mrs Lloyd said while some coal companies were good to deal with, others were  absolute horrors .
As well, the level of compensation available to landholders for all the disruption was  crap .
The Lloyds rely totally on groundwater for their 5000-head cattle feedlot and fear the CSG operation could deplete or pollute their water source.
Their water comes from shal- lower aquifers than the low-qual- ity saline water tapped by the wells.
Mrs Lloyd said water levels in their bores were dropping but trying to prove any link with the mining activity would be  an absolute impossibility .
She advised any farmers in NSW whose properties might be targets for exploration to get baseline data on their groundwater and to keep monitoring the water to measure the impact of exploration or extraction.

While environmentalists and many landholders objected, local firms welcomed the announcement as an injection into our local economy and an employment surge.
 Ostwald Bros were delighted with the decision because it allowed it to employ more people and give younger employees the opportunity to work in the area rather than leave for work.
The company was one of the first local companies to land a substantial contract from the pipeline, backing up its initial reaction that it was good for local business and the community.

There is growing support for the Hobart City Council's calls last year for a new roll-out.
 When announced in 2003, the gas roll-out was to connect 100,000 homes; so far only 40,000 have gas.
Mount Nelson resident Liam Gash says the gas pipeline finishes half way up his street.
 Why would you stop half way up the hill to Mount Nelson when the top of Mount Nelson is one of the colder areas of Hobart? 
The Liberals' Matthew Groom says the Government has failed to provide cheaper energy options and further delays could be very costly.
 I think there's an urgent need for the Government to assess the cost of a further infrastructure roll-out against the growing burden that Government has to meet concessions,  he said.
 There are many Tasmanians that simply can't afford their power bills and so there's going to be increasing pressure on Government to deliver concessions to those people.
 The most vulnerable people in our community don't have gas as an option and they're really battling when it comes to power prices. 
A government spokesman says $56 million has been invested in the roll-out of gas so far, and the target of reaching 100,000 energy users is still on track.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"ONE of the nation's biggest natural gas distributors, Envestra, is seeking a double-digit increase in gas tariffs in Victoria to fund a major capital expenditure program to upgrade ageing networks.
The company has already asked the federal government's independent gas industry umpire, the Australian Energy Regulator, to allow it to increase tariffs in South Australia by 10 per cent and Queensland by 8 per cent every year for five years from July 1 this year.
 Envestra managing director Ian Little said that, subject to the AER negotiations, the increases would help finance about $675 million of new spending on capital projects in both states over the next five years, twice the amount spent in the prior regulatory period.
Of that, $507m would be spent in South Australia alone to replace older gas mains to reduce leakage.
With regard to its Victorian gas networks, Envestra would push for a similar increase to that proposed for South Australia, he said.
``We are seeing the same thing about to be proposed in Victoria when we put our Victorian submission in for a price increase,'' Mr Little said.
The Victorian increase will take effect from January 1, 2013.
``Even in the current five year period, Victoria has a significant mains replacement program as well, going through the central city and out towards the eastern suburbs.''
Envestra delivers gas to about 30 per cent of Australia's natural gas consumers.
Charges for gas pipelines are a major part of retail gas bills, comprising about half of a typical bill in NSW and 60 per cent in South Australia.
Mr Little said the increases were also a flow-on from the global financial crisis, which had led to higher debt servicing costs.
``Of the $30 increase per year in South Australia, one third of it would just be the increased cost of capital. So it is substantial,'' Mr Little said.
The AER is expected to issue a draft determination on Envestra's South Australian and Queensland applications early this year, and a final determination in April.
In NSW, retail gas prices are forecast to rise between 3.4 per cent and 4.1 per cent on July 1 after also rising last year.
Network owner Jemena is pursuing a $760m capital spending program over the five years to 2015.
Mr Little said the gas tariff rises were dwarfed by proposed electricity price rises, where an estimated $42 billion of spending on networks will be a big driver of higher bills over the next five years. Electricity bills have risen by about 40 per cent nationwide in the past three years.
In NSW, regulated electricity prices will rise by between 10 per cent and 13 per cent on July 1.
In Queensland, power prices are due to rise by 5.83 per cent after rising 13.3 per cent last year.
In Victoria, power prices are unregulated but the AER says prices are rising because of the costs associated with smart meters and compliance with climate change policies.

FTLAND,The Land,2011,1,"As the coal seam gas (CSG) juggernaut in NSW rolls on, and almost every coal mine seeks to increase its annual run-of-mine production, many in the bush are questioning whether we are heading helter-skelter toward a catastrophe that could have lasting impacts on food security, our environment and our health.
The NSW Government has sat on its hands on the issue of producing a strategic land use plan for the State ? and given that it received mining royalties of $1.2 billion in 2008-09, that's hardly surprising.
 Rampant demand from China has pushed coal prices up by 17 per cent to $US117 a tonne since last month, and pushes to explore and expand are coming thick and fast.
Companies in NSW have almost $7 billion in committed projects right now, and more than $1.5 billion is being spent in a project that will vastly increase the export capacity of Newcastle Port.
And with that bottleneck being smashed, the rush is on to to get more coal out of the ground and off to sea.
At a meeting at Broke recently, a local told me the little Hunter township has 33 bed-and- breakfast businesses, plus wineries, and they treasure their way of life.
But I guess the revenue they provide is a drop in the bucket compared with king coal.
The Opposition won't commit to a moratorium either.
Which raises an important question: if neither side of government is willing to make a stand and put existing applications  on hold  to create a long-term land-use strategy that protects agriculture and gives miners certainty, then just who is running the State?
Independent federal MP, Tony Windsor, has the right idea about strategic land plans that protect agriculture and water resources ? a national plan makes eminent sense.
In fact it is so sensible, one suspects it is doomed for that reason, in a weary debate that so far has been devoid of commonsense from the people we pay to represent us and reflect our views.
Farmers aren't saying there's no place for mining.
It's a significant and welcome economic impetus in a lot or regional communities.
In this huge country, there's plenty of room for agriculture and mining to co-exist, with a planned approach, but somebody needs to do just that ? and quickly.
n Bronwyn Farr is a senior journalist with The Land.
"
FTLAND,The Land,2011,1,"INCLUDED in the Framework for Sustainable Development recently released by the NSW Farmers Association was a call for a pause on any new mining or coal seam gas development until a State strategic plan was developed. It caused an uproar.
Amid a predictably knee-jerk reaction and wildly exaggerated claims by the minerals industry of massive job losses and lost State revenue, we continue to pursue a commitment to change on behalf of our members.
 Farmers have a long and generally happy history with miners.
The State depends on these two great primary industries to survive economically and thrive. It's essential that we can work together.
At present, however, landholders feel they are under siege.
Seventy per cent of the State is now covered by exploration and mining tenures. This is certainly good for the minerals industry, but what of other land uses that may already exist on the land and depend on its natural resources?
How can they exist with such uncertainty and plan for the future? Do we really want mining everywhere, and why shouldn't we have this debate?
Unfortunately, legislation was historically designed to facilitate mining rather than protect valuable natural resources or landholder property rights.
All of which leaves communities and landholders worried that without proper safeguards in place, vast tracts of land could be sterilised and valuable water resources that have taken generations to form be depleted or destroyed.
Landholders are not alone in their concerns. The National Water Commission recently warned of  significant, long-term and adverse  effects on the nation's water supplies if the coal seam gas (CSG) industry is not properly regulated.
Investment banker, JP Morgan, warns that CSG development carries  significant water risks, unknown impacts from growth, and a potential risk to public safety .
Both warn that the gas extraction process could hurt other water users, such as farmers, and damage water quality in river systems.
We're not calling for the mining and coal seam gas industries to be shut down across the State, nor are we suggesting they don't have a place in NSW ? but we are suggesting that planning properly for these industries is the key.
We are advocating up-front Statewide strategic planning where valuable natural resources, urban areas for growth, mineral resources and valuable agricultural resources are recognised.
We believe such planning will deliver a diversified economy, protect our natural resources, and build a strong sustainable future for our State.
Until this is in place, we believe the sensible and rational thing to do is to take a step back, take a deep breath, and suspend new mining or coal seam gas developments, until we know what we are doing.
Otherwise, we feel the old adage  act in haste, repent at leisure  could well apply to our future generations.

"
FTLAND,The Land,2011,1,"FEDERAL and State water experts are backing calls by landholders for an urgent study of the potential impacts of coal seam gas (CSG) development on the nation's water resources.
The focus is largely on the potential $35 billion industry in south-east Queensland, where up to 40,000 wells could dot the Surat and Bowen Basins over the next 20 years ? and where there have already been water contamination incidents.
 Last month, Arrow Energy confirmed benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene ? together known as BTEX ? had been found in wells at a Bowen Basin gas site.
In October, BTEX was discovered in eight wells at drill sites run by Origin Energy about 300 kilometres west of Brisbane, while earlier this year a coal gas project near Kingaroy was shut down when benzene and toluene were detected.
While 95 per cent of known reserves are in Queensland, increasing exploration in NSW by companies, including Santos and Metgasco, is expected to uncover more reserves.
Companies are testing for CSG using hydraulic fracturing, known as  fracking .
Rules regulating this practice, which involves injecting a mix of water, sand and chemicals underground to force gas to the surface, are not clear cut, as specific approval for fracking is not required.
NSW Natural Resources Commissioner, John Williams, has warned there could be potentially catastrophic impacts on State water resources if CSG projects go ahead unchecked.
He supported a call by National Water Commissioner, Chloe Munroe, for a precautionary approach.
The National Water Commission released a position paper earlier this month identifying a variety of risks, saying cumulative impacts were not well understood, and that there could be  substantial consequences .
 If not adequately managed and regulated, the industry risks significant, long-term and adverse impacts on surface and ground-water systems,  Ms Munroe said.
She said mining should operate under the same rules applied to other water users.
Dr Williams said it was vital that mining and natural resources were integrated before mining activity occurred.
 We need a plan of action to minimise harm to water resources if coal seam gas extraction takes place,  he said.
 We do need to mine, but we need to know where we can do it without harming natural resources, and the best time to do this work is before the development happens so the community knows where it can be harvested without damaging their future and the mining industry has some security. 
He said legislation, including the Mining Act, needed to be brought into line with sustainable development principles.
Dr Williams, a member of the Wentworth Group, said taking CSG should not interfere with the viability of water resources and agricultural land, but there was no process yet to prevent this.
Ms Munroe's report said extracting large volumes of low-quality water would have an impact on connected surface and groundwater systems.
Dramatic depressurisation of coal seams could reduce pressure to nearby aquifers, reducing flows and causing land subsidence.
A report by JP Morgan said the coal gas seam industry had significant water risks, including a reduction in the water supply to towns and landowners, reduced quality, gas migration to water bores and the safe storage of salt.

There was also a potential for  large, uncontrolled releases of gas, which may pose a risk to public health and safety .

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Rumours of a major delay in the $43 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off Western Australia have picked up a lot more credibility after comments from one of its contractors, AJ Lucas.
The contractor yesterday became the first company to publicly declare a problem at Gorgon.
 AJ Lucas said there had been a  considerable delay  in the start of drilling that it was hired to carry out at the project.
Rumours of a delay of about six to eight months have been doing the rounds for some time.
Among those who referred to the start-up issues at Gorgon was arch-rival Woodside Petroleum's chief executive, Don Voelte.
While Chevron, the operator of Gorgon, continues to stick to its script of a 2014 start, the pressure appears to be building.
AJ Lucas had hoped to have wrapped up its Gorgon drilling by the end of 2010 and book the $95 million in revenues from the contract in the first half of financial year 2011.
Instead, the contractor has not even started work.
The problem for AJ Lucas has been getting its drilling equipment through tight quarantine conditions and on to Barrow Island, where Gorgon is being built. Every contractor planning to work on the monster project will have to jump through the same hoops.
Building LNG projects is never easy, hence the multibillion-dollar price tags, but Chevron has added another layer of complexity by siting the LNG plant on a class-A nature reserve.
Another implication of a delay at Gorgon could be an increased focus by Chevron on its other West Australian LNG project, Wheatstone.
The quarantine complications could prompt Chevron not to expand Gorgon in favour of enlarging Wheatstone, which appears to be a much simpler project.
The delay could have a negative effect on rival Woodside, which is expanding its Pluto project. The Gorgon and Pluto projects could overlap, creating a shortage of skills and equipment.
A delay would also mean that Chevron and its partners, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, will have to scramble to fill orders from its customers.
Gorgon is expected to produce 15 million tonnes of LNG a year, just slightly less than the North-West Shelf project, so making up this shortfall for its customers will not be easy.
Gorgon's biggest buyer is PetroChina, which ditched a contract to buy LNG from Woodside's Browse project a year ago.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The Queensland floods have taken a toll on profits at engineering services company AJ Lucas, which has also warned of  considerable delay  to work it is carrying out at Chevron's $43Â billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia.
As a result, operating cash flow would be reduced to just $3 million in the December half, the company said yesterday. That compares with a figure of $42.5Â million in the first half of financial 2010, which was boosted by some one-off items.
 The company expected  much more favourable trading conditions  in calendar 2011, helped by irrigation, coal seam methane and water infrastructure projects due to start this year.
But earnings are expected to be heavily skewed towards the second half of financial 2011. Full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were now expected to be between $32Â million and $36Â million, AJ Lucas said.
That compared with a consensus among three analysts for 2011 full-year EBITDA of $43.9Â million, according to Bloomberg data.
 It's disappointing that La Nina has come along at this time when we've had our share of difficulties in recent years and now the rains have conspired to upset our growth plans a bit,  said AJ Lucas company secretary Nicholas Swan.
AJ Lucas shares fell 2Â per cent yesterday to $2.45, taking the decline over the past year to 44 per cent.
At Gorgon, which is being built in the Barrow Island nature reserve, delays to the start of drilling work that was due to be completed by the end of 2010 mean that AJ Lucas will now book revenues only from the $95 million contract in the current half.
The horizontal drilling of nine holes on the Barrow Island shoreline to allow offshore gas pipelines to be connected to the on-land system will get under way only at the end of the month, after it took longer than expected to get drill rigs and piping to the quarantine-controlled site.
 Although we've got considerable resources on the island, in terms of supplies we need to do the work and manpower we have made very little progress towards completing that work,  Mr Swan said.
AJ Lucas will give a more detailed market update, including results from a recent strategic review, next month.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"FLOODS BRISBANE, Jan 7 AAP - Flooded mines in Queensland are being allowed to discharge water in the hope the size of the floods will dilute any damaging residues.
Since December 1, 11 coal mines in central and north Queensland, and one coal seam gas (CSG) mine in the southwest have been given permission to discharge water.
 Around 40 mines are expected to be affected by the biggest natural disaster in Queensland's history, and each is being case-managed, the government says.
 We are working closely with the mines to ensure authorised dewatering activities go ahead while there are high volumes of water to dilute the discharge and minimise the risk of environmental impact,  acting Environment Minister and Treasurer Andrew Fraser said in a statement.
 When we foresaw that this was going to be one of the worst wet seasons on record, we worked closely with each individual mine to make sure they were well prepared to meet their environmental obligations,  Mr Fraser said.
Mines Minister Stephen Robertson said six potential breaches of environmental approvals by CSG miners were under investigation.
 All incidents will be investigated, but as with the cases at coal mines, the high volume of water in the systems has greatly reduced any risk of environmental impact,  Mr Robertson said.
He said it was pleasing that no brine dams - containing the salt by-product of CSG extraction - had spilled over.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The company rolling out Tasmania's natural gas network is frustrated by the state government's decision to stop funding residential connections, and it does not appear residents are letting the issue rest.
There has been an angry reaction to the Energy Minister's announcement that only commercial connections will now be considered.
 When the rollout was announced eight years ago, the government promised 100,000 homes would be hooked up, but only 40-0000 have access to gas.
The general manager of TasGas, Richard Sheather says the government is going against the original funding agreement, in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding.
 We came to the state with an understanding that we wanted to make gas available to as possible, and as a gas utility the more people you can get onto your network the better so obviously we're keen to continue,  Mr Sheather said.
 Obviously we're still here and we're still talking to the government, so I wouldn't call it a broken promise but obviously we're a little bit frustrated that not a lot has happened in the last few years. 
Residents' lobby
Residents who missed the government-supported rollout but want to be connected to gas now have no option but to pay for it themselves and some do not accept the situation.
East Launceston resident Scott Bell has formed a lobby group.
 Gas is really important in this city from the air pollution point of view but really for domestic consumption to ease the financial burden on the population,  he said.
Welfare groups are also disappointed there are no plans to connect more residential users.
Daryl Lamb of Anglicare in Launceston says it does not add up.
 We know that the electricity costs are going to be increasing, gas is roughly half the cost of electricity so it's extremely disappointing. 
The Greens MP Tim Morris wants a taskforce set up to investigate the issue.
 The Local Government Association or individual councils and the state government should get together with the gas company and start to design some parameters (by) where individual streets, perhaps just one street away from the gas at the moment can get to understand how much money they will have to put up collectively to get the gas down their street,  Mr Morris said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Macquarie Group is set to go into direct competition with Australian liquefied natural gas suppliers through its gas export venture on the US Texas coast, which is targeting some of Australia's biggest LNG customers.
The move reflects a dramatic transformation in the gas market in the US, which in the space of a few years has switched from an important importer of LNG into a potential major exporter.
 The Australian financial group is already in negotiations with potential customers in Japan, China and South Korea, which may take supplies from or book capacity at the planned $2 billion Freeport LNG export terminal on the Gulf of Mexico, said Nicholas O'Kane, global head of energy markets for Macquarie.
 Marketing in earnest has started and we'll be looking to sign up customers from now on,  Mr O'Kane told the Weekend AFR.
 The response initially has been very, very strong, so we'll just see how we go. 
Macquarie calls its foray into US LNG exports a logical extension of its gas trading business but it also illustrates a wider step-change in world energy markets and the spectre of the US emerging as a serious competitor in Asia for Australia's $220 billion line-up of proposed LNG supply projects.
Only a few years ago Woodside Petroleum and BHP Billiton had plans (since scrapped) to develop LNG terminals on the Californian coast to receive gas from their West Australian projects.
Driving the turnaround is the surge in shale gas production in the US, which has kept a lid on natural gas prices in North America. The US benchmark gas price, at the Henry Hub pricing point, averaged about $US4.50 per million British thermal units last year, compared with prices typical in Europe of about $US8 and closer to $US10 in Asia, according to consultancy PFC Energy.
 Is LNG from North America at a Henry Hub price of $US4.50 competitive with Australian LNG? Against some Australian projects, it is indeed,  said PFC analyst Nick Tsafos.
But the economics rapidly change should US prices rise, making the proposition much more complicated given most LNG export projects rely on contracts that can last a couple of decades.
Under the accord announced last November, Macquarie will contribute to the initial development costs of the Freeport LNG export project at Quintana Island, about 115 kilometres south of Houston, but not to the capital costs.
While it will not have an equity stake in the terminal, it has an exclusive right to market at least 50 per cent of its gas liquefaction and export capacity.
The Freeport LNG export venture is the second announced in the US within months after private company Cheniere announced a similar plan in June to add export capability to its Sabine Pass import terminal, also on the Texas coast.
The projects are the first LNG export projects in the US for 40 years, since the Kenai plant in Alaska started exports to Asia in 1969.
Assuming the Freeport terminal operates at capacity at its start-up, due in 2015, Macquarie will be responsible for about nine cargoes a month, and is expected to target the higher-priced Asian gas markets rather than Europe, where gas prices are not so closely linked to crude oil prices.
 We think that these US liquefaction schemes have some potential, but from an economic perspective they look more viable supplying LNG into Asia than Europe,  said Frank Harris, global head of LNG at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Mr Harris said that some Asian importers might be interested in taking some limited capacity in US LNG export terminals as contract prices based on a premium to Henry Hub prices could offer better value than oil-indexed LNG out of Australia.
Mr O'Kane has flagged that Macquarie will be targeting LNG importers across Asia.
 At this stage, initial conversations have been with customers in Korea, Japan and China, but we'll be spending a lot of time in north Asia but also in south-east Asia as well,  he said.
The expansion of the Panama Canal will help drive the entry of the US into Asian LNG markets, according to industry sources.
The $US5.2 billion enlargement project, due for completion in 2014, will open up the strategic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to standard LNG tankers, which are currently too big to pass through.

Macquarie Group is setting up a gas export venture in Texas.
The US has moved from an LNG importer to an exporter and is targeting Australia's customers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Plans by Indian industrial conglomerate Reliance Industries for a huge $US1.2Â billion liquefied natural gas import terminal will be music to the ears of Australian LNG producers and hopefuls.
Reliance's plans for the terminal had been shelved due to its own gas discoveries off India but with demand for gas continuing to grow, the company intends to go ahead with the 5Â million tonne-a-year facility.
 India is well positioned for LNG imports, sitting roughly equidistant between the world's biggest LNG producer, Qatar, and Australia, which is on its way to becoming No.2.
Reliance's news is good for Australia on two fronts. First, it represents a very handy potential buyer for the likes of Origin Energy's and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG project, which is desperate for customers.
Second, even if Reliance doesn't partner with Australian LNG producers, it could absorb LNG production from Qatar that would otherwise compete with Australian LNG in markets such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China.
A big risk to LNG supply and demand in the Asia-Pacific region has been the potential for Qatari LNG to flood the market. Qatar's rich associated liquids production means it could give away LNG and still record a healthy profit and, with US LNG demand having disappeared, there were fears Qatar's LNG would increasingly wind up in Asia.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"This is the week the bulls who invested in NSW coal-seam gas player Eastern Star Gas have been waiting for.
The believers have long hoped that Santos would buy out Eastern Star and incorporate its growing NSW gas reserves into Santos' proposed $14Â billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas project (GLNG) in Queensland.
 We're now just days from the expiry of the clause that optimists believe will free Santos to bid for Eastern Star. Eastern Star bulls have been clinging to the date JanuaryÂ 15 like believers in the Mayan calendar ever since Santos took its initial stake in Eastern Star in July 2009.
At the time, Santos purchased a 19.9Â per cent stake in Eastern Star from Hillgrove Resources for $176Â million, plus a 35Â per cent interest in several Eastern Star permits for a further $300Â million.
Under the terms of the purchase from Hillgrove, which equated to $1 a share, Santos was bound to pay Hillgrove the difference on any takeover offer for Eastern Star priced above $1 a share and launched within 18Â months of the original transaction.
That requirement formally expires on Saturday, hence the belief that a Santos offer could come as early as next week. (With Eastern Star closing at 78.5Â¢ on Friday, there's a good chance Santos won't have to go too far above $1Â a share to get its mark.)
Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Eastern Star has until Friday to terminate or pay up on its proposed $25Â million acquisition of a site for a small-scale LNG plant in Newcastle â€“ a site of no interest to Santos.
As far as Santos' financial ability for an Eastern Star tilt goes, its larger than expected sales of stakes in GLNG has left it cashed up and with smaller than forecast capital expenditure commitments.
The GLNG partners are eyeing an initial two-train LNG development, but Santos has previously said the site has room for up to five trains.
Santos has also avoided taking a board seat at Eastern Star, which has been interpreted as a sign of Santos' acquisitive intentions.
Sadly, those convinced of an impending offer may have to take a cold shower.
While Santos has in the past had trouble proving up reserves for GLNG, further feeding expectation of a move on Eastern Star, Santos put many of those concerns to bed with a big recent reserve upgrade in Queensland.
Plus, with its major shareholding in Eastern Star likely to deter rival bidders, with Eastern Star's LNG ambitions still embryonic and with real decisions on an expansion of GLNG still several years away, Santos is unlikely to be in any rush to snap up Eastern Star.

ILM,Illawarra Mercury,2011,1,"PLANET Gas has started asking residents along Joadja and Wombeyan Caves roads for permission to begin a seismic survey into a coal seam gas development.
Approval is needed from landowners within 200m of any survey, which it says will have  minimal impacts  on the environment.
 The firm has signed a deal to explore three leases for coal seam gas held by Leichhardt Resources.
The Shoalhaven lease, PEL469, covers 3100sq km, including most of the Southern Highlands.
If the surveys prove successful, drilling for coal methane gas could start in the next few years.
Wingecarribee Shire Council, which passed a motion opposing any coal seam gas extraction, needs to approve any tests that are conducted on its roads.
The council confirmed that Planet Gas had written to the mayor indicating its plans on November 29.
Acting council general manager Michael Brearley said any decision on whether to allow the company to conduct the survey on its roads would be decided by staff, not by council members.
Planet Gas CEO Ian Halstead said the tests would involve a truck setting off acoustic waves on a 20km stretch of road, which would then be measured to indicate the depth of any coal seams.
The Southern Highlands Coal Action Group, (SHCAG), set up to oppose a possible coalmine at Sutton Forest, is leading opposition to coal seam gas extraction.
Spokesman Peter Martin said it was important the community opposed what he said was an environmentally destructive practice - particularly where the  fracking  extraction method was used.
His message to landowners was:  Don't let them get started. 
But Mr Halstead said there had been a lot of hysteria about coal seam gas, driven by the US documentary Gasland, which the SHCAG screened twice at Bowral in December to sell-out audiences.
 Planet Gas will ensure it uses a environmentally friendly drilling fluid system. The shallow well would take 25-35 days from construction to returning the area to its natural state,  he said.
Mr Halstead said the company would undertake three surveys, starting in March. Exploratory drilling could start in June.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2011,1,"Santos Ltd and its partners have given the final go-ahead for the multibillion dollar Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) project in Queensland.
The gas giant said it and joint venture partners PETRONAS, Total and KOGAS had decided to proceed with the $US16 billion ($A16.11 billion) coal seam gas project.
 Santos chief David Knox was quick to allay fears the 6,000 jobs expected to be created for the venture may take scarce labour needed to help Queensland rebuild after torrential floods that have devastated parts of the state.
 There will be a ramp-up period and so I think the immediate response to the floods and our project will not overlap,  Mr Knox told reporters.
It was widely expected the project would be given the green light, after Korea's KOGAS agreed last month to purchase 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of gas from the project over 20 years, worth an estimated $US120 billion.
Malaysian energy giant PETRONAS also has an agreement to buy 3.5 mtpa of GLNG's production over a 20 year period.
The two-train project will have a nameplate capacity of 7.8mtpa, with LNG exports to begin in 2015, making it among the biggest coal seam gas project in Australia.
 The approval of GLNG is a significant milestone in Santos' history,  Mr Knox said in a teleconference.
Patersons oil and gas analyst Scott Simpson said the final investment decision for GLNG was good news for Santos, and was a result he had been expecting.
 The timing of the announcement, around the floods, just shows it is business as usual and they will work through any technical challenges to deliver the project,  Mr Simpson said.
Following the announcement, Standard & Poors took Santos Ltd off creditwatch and reaffirmed the company's investment grade BBB+ rating.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"SANTOS SYDNEY, Jan 13 AAP - Santos Ltd says the Gladstone Liquid Natural Gas (GLNG) partners have approved the development of the $US16 billion ($A16.11 billion) GLNG project in Queensland.
Santos says major works will now to commence for upstream field development, pipeline and LNG plant facilities.
 Santos estimates the project will create 1,500 jobs in the first half of 2011, with orders now to be placed for long lead items such as line pipe, compressors and LNG plant components.
GLNG is a joint venture between Santos, which owns 30 per cent, and three of the world's largest LNG companies, PETRONAS (27.5%), Total (27.5%) and KOGAS (15%).
Santos chief executive David Knox said approval of the project came at a very difficult time for Queensland, which is confronting the human and economic cost of severe flooding across many communities.

The Gladstone Liquid Natural Gas (GLNG) partners have approved the development of the $US16 billion ($A16.11 billion) GLNG project in Queensland.
 Santos Ltd says major works will now start on upstream field development, a 420km pipeline and LNG plant facilities.
GLNG is a joint venture between Santos, which owns 30 per cent, and three of the world's largest LNG companies, PETRONAS, Total and KOGAS.
Mr Ferguson on Thursday told reporters in Canberra the project could create 1500 jobs in the first half of this year and 5000 jobs during construction, with 1000 permanent production roles.
He said the project would make Australia the world's second-biggest LNG exporter by 2015.
But he admitted there would be competing demands for workers as Queensland rebuilt from the flooding.
 They are going to be matters that are going to have to be discussed in detail at a government level once we get through the immediate challenges on the flood front,  Mr Ferguson said.
 We already have a challenge at the moment in terms of the shortage of labour in Australia and the potential impact on wages - we are aware of those matters and I suppose the difficulties in Queensland at the moment add to those challenges. 
Mr Ferguson said he did not support a boost in the migration program to address the skilled labour shortage.
 I think we've got a pretty good migration program at the moment,  he said.
 I'm not proposing and no-one is proposing at the moment a huge increase in migration to actually work out how we attend to the immediate challenge of reconstruction (in Queensland) and projects such as Santos, but they are issues that government considers from time to time. 
Meanwhile, Mr Ferguson said he expected to have a final draft of new resources tax legislation prepared by the second half of 2011 after further public consultation and talks with Treasury.
He said he expected outstanding issues with the states over royalties would be resolved  in due course .

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"SANTOS MELBOURNE, Jan 13 AAP - Gas giant Santos Ltd has moved to allay fears that thousands of jobs needed to build a new gas plant may take much-needed workers from Queensland's flood recovery.
Santos on Thursday announced the $US16 billion ($A16.11 billion) Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) joint venture project it leads had been given the final go ahead.
 About 5,000 jobs are expected to be needed for the construction phase of the coal seam gas project in addition to 1,000 permanent jobs in production.
With Queensland in the midst of its worst ever flood crisis, there have been concerns GLNG could compete for skilled labour.
But Santos chief executive David Knox said work on the project, which will not commence exports until 2015, would gradually increase it staff to a peak in 2013.
 There will be a ramp-up period and so I think the immediate response to the floods and our project will not overlap,  Mr Knox said.
Asked whether the flood crisis could put pressure on labour costs, Mr Knox said:  There may be some short term issues we believe we will complement, we won't be competing. 
He said workers will be encouraged to move from other eastern states to work on the project.
 There are a fair number who have moved from the east, all the way to the west,  Mr Know said, referring to the workers needed in resource-rich Western Australia.
 What we will be offering them of course is to come north,  he said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"SANTOS SYDNEY, Jan 13 AAP - As businesses and communities battle the aftermath of Queensland's devastating floods, the burgeoning coal-seam-gas (CSG) industry is surging ahead with the approval of a second multi-billion LNG export project.
The US$16 billion Gladstone liquid natural gas (GLNG) project, in development by Santos Ltd and a consortium of major international players, is due to make its first LNG shipment to customers in Korea and Malaysia in 2015.
 The project will process 7.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) making it the second-largest CSG-LNG project in Australia.
British-owned BG Group Plc also approved the US$15 billion Curtis LNG project last October, which will ship 8.5 mtpa of LNG to customers in China, Japan, Singapore and Chile from 2014.
Coal seam gas development is booming on Australia's east coast, with more major export projects in planning by Origin Energy Ltd and ConocoPhillips - Australia Pacific LNG - and Shell Plc and PetroChina.
GLNG involves extracting coal seam gas, which refers to methane trapped in coal seams hundreds of metres below the ground, from resources in the Bowen and Surat Basins in south-east Queensland.
In order to extract CSG, water holding the gas inside cracks and fissures in the coal seam is removed, releasing the pressure on the gas so it flows to the surface.
CSG can be used for the same purposes as other natural gases, such as domestic heating and cooking and commercial uses.
In the case of the GLNG venture, the gas will be piped 420 km to Gladstone for processing into LNG and export to Asia.
In Australia as a whole, about 20 per cent of natural gas comes from CSG, while in Queensland it is about 70 per cent.
Santos says the CSG sector is expected to contribute $40 billion in investments and tens of thousands of new jobs to Queensland alone.
Queensland has Australia's largest onshore reserves of coal seam gas in the Bowen and Surat Basins, but there are also exploration projects in the Hunter Valley and Sydney's south.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"Resources company Santos has confirmed a decision to invest $16 billion in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Gladstone in central Queensland.
The company has formed a partnership with Malaysia's Petronas and Kogas to develop the plant to process 7.8 million tonnes of gas per year at Curtis Island.
 The project received government approval late last year and Santos expects LNG exports will start in 2015.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Energy - Flood crisis
The likelihood of delays to Queensland's $50 billion liquefied natural gas industry is increasing by the day and reconstruction efforts after the floods could add to the already constrained labour market facing the projects.
 While the key coal seam gas players in the state have reported little disruption to production, field work has largely ground to a halt.
There are increasing concerns that damage to infrastructure such as roads and bridges could delay efforts to restart exploration and development efforts.
Also, the rebuilding in the state could exacerbate the already strained labour situation facing the LNG industry.
Coal seam gas drilling contractor Savanna Energy's general manager, Mike Bill, said it was inevitable that the whole coal seam gas-LNG industry would face delays given the scale of the work planned.
 They are all going to be delayed because of the lack of road access, with all the water through there, and washed-out roads, approaches and bridges and so forth,  Mr Bill said.  There will be delays, there is no doubt about that. 
Calgary-based Savanna Energy, which has a drilling contract with Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips's Australia Pacific LNG project, has reported  extensive damage  to one of two rigs it has imported from Canada. A second rig is also inaccessible.
Origin Energy has put all its exploration on hold because of access issues and said about a dozen wells out of 300 were out of action.
Work on the gas fields behind the Santos-led Gladstone LNG project has also halted. The company is also suspending drilling activity and field construction at its coal seam gas operations.
BG Group has reported only  minimal impact  to the fields supporting its Queensland Curtis LNG project, but the bulk of BG's field staff are assisting with disaster relief activities in affected communities.
However, the most significant impact on the coal seam gas industry from the floods could surface once the waters subside.
BG's recently approved QCLNG project, Santos's soon to be approved GLNG development and Origin and Conoco's APLNG project are together expected to employ 15,000 people during construction and analysts had flagged labour as a major challenge for the projects.
Macquarie Research analyst Adrian Wood said reconstruction efforts following the floods would present more competition for labour in the state.
 There was already going to be a massive constraint for tradespeople of any kind in the next five years or so and the more of them that need to be used in residential housing, the less available for other things,  Mr Wood said.
Mr Wood noted that operations in South Australia's Cooper Basin were still dealing with the impact of floods there early last year.
 Everyone was having massive production interruptions in the Cooper and you've got to think this is worse,  he said.
CLSA analyst Di Brookman said activity levels on the LNG projects were just ramping up and the full impact of the floods on the LNG project timetables would depend on the duration of the floods.
 On the surface of it they're going to need a lot of people to fix roads, rail, bridges and everything else, and if you were actively using people right now on LNG projects there'd be a problem,  Ms Brookman said.  I just don't think [the LNG developers] are there yet. 
Coal seam gas now accounts for around 10 per cent of Santos's gas production, with the bulk of that output coming from the Fairview field. Fairview sits on an escarpment above the floodwaters, but the flooding has limited access to the field and has cut off supplies. Savanna's misfortune comes only weeks after the rigs began operating.
The delivery of the rigs was delayed by several months because of the wet weather and they had been working at Origin's Talinga field, west of Dalby, for only two or three weeks before being consumed by the floods. After flying over the field, Mr Bill said it appeared waters had reached three to four metres, swamping most of the equipment.
It might take two to three weeks before the rigs could be moved to Toowoomba for repairs, which would then take up to three months, Mr Bill said.
Savanna still plans to import more equipment to Queensland and expects to pick up drilling contracts from Santos, BG and other operators.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"RESOURCES Minister Martin Ferguson says a decision by resources company Santos to approve its $US16 billion LNG project in Queensland proves Australia has moved beyond the ``argy-bargy'' of the mining tax turmoil and is ``open for business''.
Adelaide-based Santos yesterday announced final investment approval for its Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas joint venture, which will create 5000 construction jobs and 1000 permanent production jobs.
 Those behind the project, which will process up to 7.8 million tonnes of coal-seam gas a year on Curtis Island off Gladstone from 2015, said it would not compete for skilled workers in flood-ravaged Queensland.
Santos chief executive David Knox said he did not believe the immediate response to the Queensland flood rebuilding effort and the Gladstone project would overlap.
He welcomed the final go-ahead for the joint venture and branded it a ``huge win for Australia'' that would make the nation the world's second-largest LNG exporter within five years, behind Qatar.
``It is also a significant statement, I suppose, following the turmoil of last year with respect to changes in potential tax regimes, that Australia is open for business.''
Mr Ferguson said the outcome proved there was now a ``tax regime that is . . . largely accepted by industry, creates certainty and it continues to ensure that Australia is competitive internationally. The Santos announcement today sends a very important message on that front.''
The protracted stand-off over the federal government's revamped mining tax was resolved late last month after a government-initiative taskforce led by Mr Ferguson and former BHP Billiton chairman Don Argus said the government should not hit mining companies with a federal tax and then expect them to bear the cost of future state royalty increases.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, who is grappling with the floods crisis, welcomed the Gladstone project go-ahead in a joint statement with Santos.
``Proceeding now with projects like this will be a tremendous boost to the Queensland economy as we recover from the devastating impact of the floods,'' she said.
Santos is developing the LNG project with Malaysia's Petronas, France's Total and South Korea's Kogas.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"ABOUT $31 billion of investment is to be unleashed in Queensland after Santos and its partners yesterday announced the go-ahead for a $US16 billion ($A16.2 billion) coal seam gas development, the second of the controversial projects to be approved.
Adelaide-based oil and gas explorer Santos, which owns 30 per cent of the Gladstone LNG (GLNG) project, and offshore partners Petronas, Total and Kogas, said the decision to proceed meant orders would immediately be placed for pipes, compressors and LNG plant components.
 Up to 1500 jobs are expected to be created between now and June.
Last October, UK-based BG Group became the first to give final investment clearance to a major project to convert coal seam gas from the Surat and Bowen basins into LNG for Asian and domestic energy markets at processing plants at Gladstone.
Its Queensland Curtis LNG project, to be operated by BG unit QGC, involves $US15 billion spent on two LNG processing lines - or trains - and wells, field facilities and pipelines.
BG expects first LNG exports from 2014. Santos's schedule sees first shipments from its two-train project in 2015.
Santos chief executive David Knox said he didn't expect any impacts on the project from Queensland's flood disaster.
``We're confident we will achieve first gas in 2015. We've got sufficient flexibility in our schedule. We will gradually ramp up this year in terms of staff numbers. Our peak employment isn't until 2013,'' Mr Knox said.
State and federal environmental approvals granted last year had cleared the way for the GLNG and QCLNG partners to take their final investment decisions.
The environmental approvals came despite calls from agricultural industries, water management groups and environmentalists for a comprehensive scientific analysis of water impacts from CSG mining to be conducted. The National Water Commission last month issued a major report on CSG mining risks in areas such as the Surat Basin, which is part of the Murray-Darling Basin and lies above the Great Artesian Basin.
National Water Commissioner Chloe Munro said the CSG industry ``risks significant, long-term and adverse impacts on surface and groundwater systems''.
She stressed that the potential impacts of CSG projects over a significant time period ``are not well understood''.
CSG mining involves bringing saline underground water to the surface in order to release trapped gas, and there are fears that water networks will be depleted or contaminated.
The NWC raised major concerns with water practices proposed by CSG miners and issued recommendations for state and federal governments, including that CSG miners obtain licences for any water extracted.
The NWC said the CSG industry could extract 7500 gigalitres of water from groundwater systems over 25 years, or about 300GL a year. Currently, Australia's total extraction from the Great Artesian Basin is about 540GL a year.
Mr Knox said that he was not aware of the NWC recommendations.
New England MP Tony Windsor has said he will use his balance of power position in Federal Parliament this year to force CSG miners to conduct assessments of long-term, regional impacts of their controversial practices, either before exploration licences are granted or if necessary before mining proceeds. Santos shares closed up 2.2 per cent, or 29c, at $13.45. The broader market rebounded roughly 1.5 per cent.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The signing of the $US16 billion Gladstone LNG project might finally shake off the last vestiges of market scepticism about Santos. In just a few years, it has blossomed from a state government-protected basket case seemingly unable to execute on any sort of expansion beyond the Cooper Basin; to a serious player in the liquefied natural gas sector.
The fact that Santos has finally given the green light to its flagship LNG project means the overwhelming majority of its growth plans are locked in.
 Its projected growth is not contingent on finding new customers or new exploration, and all of its projects have defined gas reserves.
In its stable of four LNG projects, one is in production, another is under construction, its key growth plank GLNG was approved yesterday, and only one, a floating LNG project with GDF Suez, is still considered prosÂ­pective. That one entered the Â­feasibility study stage this week.
Chief executive David Knox had a lot to prove in bringing the Gladstone deal to fruition.
Many thought he couldn't. Woodside chief executive Don Voelte was one in particular who was not a believer in the coal seam gas story at all. But unlike the Santos of old, the company did deliver on its commitment and it won praise from investors and analysts alike after yesterday's announcement.
Santos has partnered with Total of France, Petronas of Malaysia and Korea Gas Corp to develop the project, expected to produce 7.8 million tonnes of LNG a year and create 5000 construction jobs and 1000 permanent positions.
Analysts at JPMorgan â€“ admittedly an adviser to the company â€“ declared Santos as the top pick in the sector yesterday, and downgraded its recommendations on rivals Woodside and Oil Search.
JPMorgan's view, backed by investors such as Neil Boyd-Clark from Arnhem Investment Management, is that the upside at Santos is yet to be fully priced in, whereas the reverse is true for its rivals.
Santos trades at a forecast price- earnings multiple of 33.5 times, well above the benchmark index rate of 13.7 but significantly below rival Oil Search, trading at 70 times its forecast P/E. Even Woodside, which has suffered a series of setbacks, is trading at 22 times forecast P/E.
Comparing growth prospects of the three companies, there is continued uncertainty around Woodside's Pluto expansion project, which has also yet to confirm gas reserves, and doubts about its other major growth projects, Browse and Sunrise LNG.
Oil Search has the massive PNG LNG project under way, but judging by the company's share price Â­mulÂ­tiples, this has been well and truly factored in.
To be sure, it's not surprising that it's taken time for the Santos turnÂ­around story to be believed. The company is only now starting to move from frontier explorer to a long-term, substantial LNG project manager.
The Santos project is one of four being planned for the central Queensland coast, raising questions about those LNG producers looking to lock in final investment decisions this year that are yet to firm up their Â­customers. Although the Adelaide-based company was beaten to the punch by BG Group, which signed off on its project in October, Santos was the first to identify the commercial potential in Australia of liquefying gas extracted from coal seams to sell to the export market.
Knox took over the reins in 2008, the same year the South Australian government cancelled the legislated 15 per cent shareholding cap on the company.
The cap on Santos protected management from years of under-delivery and the ultimate consequence of poor performance â€“ being taken out by a rival. During that time, it was a proxy for the oil price, with little to show for its efforts to expand beyond its historic base of the Cooper Basin.
But instead of disappearing once it became fair game, the company has gone from strength to strength.
It's been able to attract high-calibre partners in the form of Petronas, Total and Korea Gas, a clear sign that the industry is a believer in the Knox- led turnaround. While Knox has succeeded in setting up the foundations for GLNG, with strong partners and customers and a healthy balance sheet to cover its share of costs, it's in the construction process that things get tricky. Santos has no experience in that regard, so will need to lean heavily on its partners.
Santos has tried to minimise the risk of blowouts by signing up fixed prices for the bulk of its big-ticket contracts. The concern among the broader industry on fixed-price contracts is that the operator can lose its say over schedules. Santos's fixed- price contracts, however, include bonus payments and penalties linked to schedule performance that Knox will hope will provide sufficient incentives to get the job done.
Santos has four LNG projects: the Darwin project with Conoco, in which it has an 11.5 per cent stake, is already in production; its PNG project with Exxon Mobil, in which it has a 13.5 per cent stake, is under construction; it has a 30 per cent stake in the Gladstone project approved yesterday; and a 40 per cent stake in the prospective Bonaparte LNG project with GDF Suez.
But although yesterday's signing of the Gladstone deal is a major leap Â­forward for Santos, the next major question will be reaching the production stage on time and on budget.
There are concerns that Queensland's labour and capacity constraints will still stretch the budget despite the $US2 billion of contingencies and its fixed-price engineering contracts.
That could be a problem for Santos given it has locked in the price for its LNG.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Oil and gas producer Santos will deliver a $US16 billion stimulus package to Queensland, with the Adelaide-based company and its partners in the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project formally approving the huge development yesterday.
The final investment decision on the Gladstone LNG project means that more than $100 billion has now been committed to LNG projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea in the past 3Â½ years.
 While the wave of developments is set to catapult Australia from the world's sixth-largest LNG producer to the second largest, the surging Â­volume of LNG projects under or entering construction is adding to the prospects of labour shortages in the industry.
The Queensland projects of Santos and rival British LNG player BG Group, which approved its project in October, are now also set to face added competition for labour from rebuilding after the floods.
Gladstone LNG will employ up to 5000 people over the course of its four-year construction, with Santos chief executive David Knox describing the development as  a very important economic stimulus  to Queensland at a difficult time.
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh yesterday said the state faced a  reconstruction of postwar proportions  as it recovered from the floods, but Mr Knox said he was confident the gradual ramp-up in employees at Gladstone LNG would minimise the competition between the industry and reconstruction efforts.
The project is set to employ about 1500 people in the coming months, with numbers expected to gradually increase to a peak of 5000 in 2013.
BG's Queensland Curtis LNG proÂ­ject, which was approved late last year, and Origin Energy and ConocoÂ­Phillips' Australia Pacific LNG proÂ­ject, also in Queensland, are each expected to employ 5000 people during construction. In Western Australia, the $43 billion Chevron-led Gorgon LNG project that is being built will create 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. The workforce at Woodside Petroleum's almost-complete Pluto LNG project peaked last year at about 3500.
Mr Knox said that, while the flood rebuilding would require considerÂ­able amounts of labour, the bulk of work to be done by the Santos-led GLNG project this year will be in non-competing skills.
Work on its 420 kiloÂ­metre pipeline, which will probably require similar skills and equipment to the rebuilding process, will start only late this year or early 2012.
 As we gradually ramp up, it won't in any way take resources from what will be a very significant effort to recover from the floods in Queensland,  Mr Knox told The Australian Financial Review.  What we will be doing is providing longer term emÂ­ployment opportunities. 
Ms Bligh said GLNG promised Â­billions of dollars of investment in regional communities.
 Proceeding now with projects like this will be a tremendous boost to the Queensland economy as we recover from the devastating impact of the floods,  Ms Bligh said.
Santos has projected that GLNG will generate about $US6 billion in revenues a year when in production, or more than $120 billion during its first 20 years.
GLNG will consist of two trains, or processing lines, at Curtis Island off the port of Gladstone, with the trains capable of producing up to 7.8 million tonnes per year of LNG when it comes into production in 2015. The trains will be fed by a 420 kilometre pipeline connecting the plant to hundreds of coal seam gas wells throughout the Bowen and Surat basins.
The GLNG venture's key coal seam gas fields have largely escaped damage during the flooding as they are situated on escarpments. But the floodwaters have cut off access to the fields, with Santos pulling out the bulk of its field workforce. The company's Brisbane office has also been closed since Wednesday and will not reopen until Monday.
Arnhem Invesment Management managing partner Neil Boyd-Clarke said sourcing labour would be a critical issue for GLNG and other major projects around Australia.
 Finding labour for this project is going to be a challenge, but they're not alone. All major project developers in Australia are going to find keeping and retaining staff a challenge over the next several years,  Mr Boyd-Clarke said.
 Santos and the GLNG joint venture has the advantage of being located in an attractive part of the world with a reasonably substantial local population, which should help. 
Santos will own a 30 per cent stake in GLNG, with its partners Petronas of Malaysia and Total of France holding 27.5 per cent each and Korea Gas owning 15 per cent.
Petronas and Kogas have each agreed to buy 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from the project.
Sales of equity stakes in the project to its partners and a $500 million equity raising just before Christmas have left Santos's $US4.8 billion share of the construction costs for the project all but fully funded.
Ratings agency Standard and Poor's yesterday reaffirmed Santos's BBB+credit rating, citing the company's efforts to reduce risks at the project, and its  willingness to take credit-supportive actions .
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said the GLNG project faced challenges in attracting skilled labour.  We already have a challenge at the moment in terms of the shortage of labour in Australia and the potential impact on wages. We are aware of those matters and I suppose the difficulties in Queensland at the moment add to those challenges,  he said. But he said he did not support increasing skilled migration.
 I'm not proposing, and no one is proposing at the moment, a huge increase in migration to actually work out how we attend to the immediate challenge of reconstruction and projects such as Santos, but they are issues that the government considers from time to time,  he said.
Santos and its partners have signed up international contractors Bechtel, Fluor and Saipem to lead the construction of the project.
Mr Knox said the depth of the workforces of each contractor had been crucial in their selection by the project partners.  We thought very hard about [labour] in the planning stage, which is why we've got these big contractors, which is why we've got a ramp up over time to make sure we secure the right skills,  he said.
 The big contractors that we have have already got a large amount of people on their books in Australia that they've used, that they know. That will be our principal source of labour for this project. 
GLNG will almost double Santos's current revenue.

Hastings Fund Management, whose wholly owned subsidiary, Epic Energy, has an agreement to pipe gas from Santos's gas operations in South Australia into Queensland, said the final investment decision on GLNG  materially  increased the likelihood of the agreement proceeding.

CAMPAIGN FOR WORKERS WILL PUSH THE GLADSTONE FACTOR
Santos has set itself on the path toward a hiring war with its West Australian liquefied natural gas rivals, singling out their fly-in fly-out workers as a recruiting target.
Santos chief executive David Knox yesterday said the company would specifically target eastern states-based employees working on projects in WA, as he looked to fill the 5000 vacancies created by yesterday's approval of the $US16 billion GLNG project at Gladstone in Queensland. Rival Queensland projects are expected to create a further 10,000 jobs in the coming years.
WA resource companies have increasingly turned to flying in workers from the eastern states as a means of addressing labour shortages in the state, with oil and gas companies Woodside Petroleum and Chevron and mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto among them.
But the Queensland LNG projects such as that approved yesterday by Santos and its partners will be able to offer shorter travel times for workers who hope to base themselves in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.
Santos chief executive David Knox is confident Gladstone itself can also prove an attractive place to live for many workers, particularly compared with WA industrial towns such as Port Hedland and Karratha.
 We're aware quite a number of people do travel from the east to the west, and we're now able to offer the people with the right skills a long-term employment opportunity in Gladstone helping us build the facilities and pipeline, and ultimately in the longer term jobs in the operation [of the plant],  he said.
 It's on the east coast, Gladstone's an attractive place to work, it's good for the family, so it's a very attractive offer. 
While Australia's LNG construction boom is still in its early days, the industry is a hotbed for poaching. Woodside and Chevron are already waging a war for talent in Perth as both companies pursue aggressive growth projects.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Mines need to be drained and supporting infrastructure needs repair but no one can say how long it will take to return to business as usual. Story Dan Hall and Angela Macdonald-Smith
Queensland's economic recovery hangs in the balance as the nation's second largest export state counts the cost of the floods. The pace of growth in the state's burgeoning coal seam gas sector has slowed and coalminers have begun draining inundated mines to assess the damage.
 Around 40 mines are affected by flooding, wiping more than 15Â million tonnes of coal shipments off the export market, Goldman Sachs reports.
This means a hole in forecast state coal royalties of about $3.2Â billion in 2010-11.
Roughly half the affected production, or about 8.2 million tonnes, is from producers in the Fitzroy Basin area west of Rockhampton.
Half of that comprises high-value coking coal used in steel-making, with producers such as Wesfarmers, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Xstrata declaring force majeure.
Flooding and landslides damaged tracks in the Fitzroy Basin and Toowoomba Ranges, cutting supplies of coal to power plants and export terminals.
The good news on Thursday was that rail operator QR National said it would reopen the Blackwater line between mines west of Rockhampton and the Port of Gladstone on about January 20.
The line closed on December 29, forcing Gladstone Ports Corporation to run down severely diminished stockpiles and turn vessels away.
The Port of Gladstone, now the epicentre of a world-wide coking coal shortage, is likely to operate at a fraction of its 75 million tonne per year capacity into next week as prices break through $US300 per tonne, says Gladstone Ports chief executive Leo Zussino.
Coal reserves dropped below 450,000 tonnes this week, the minimum amount required to be able to load vessels and 5.5 million tonnes less than storage capacity.
In the south-east, Queensland Rail's Toowoomba Range line, the main supply route from New Hope's mines in the Darling Downs to Swanbank Power Station, was hit by landslides.
Queensland Rail crews are unable to assess the extent of damage to the main western rail line from Brisbane, Transport Minister Rachel Nolan says.
 Given the extent of flash flooding in Toowoomba, it is likely there is more than one landslip and so the task is considerable. 
The line supplies thermal coal to the port of Brisbane, which is also critically low of coal reserves, and the coal and gas-fired Swanbank Power Station. Swanbank is nineâ€Šâ€Škilometres from the central business district in Ipswich and access is threatened by rising floodwater.
Stanwell Power Â­Station, which is 22 kilometres west of Rockhampton, has hired a helicopter to fly essential staff in and out. Floods have restricted access to CS Energy's Kogan Creek Power Station near Chinchilla.
The fallout from damaged rail lines is not limited to miners. QR National, Queensland's largest coal hauler, was hit hard and says the impact on tonnages and network recovery costs remained  under assessment .
Major competitor Asciano will also be affected by the flooding. The coal hauler issued a profit warning on Wednesday, cautioning that its customers had started to issue force majeure notices on haulage contracts.
 While the rain persists, so does the risk of production losses,  Goldman Sachs analysts Malcolm Southwood and Paul Gray warn.
Queensland's coal seam gas producers reported minimal disruption to production but exploration and drilling work has stopped. The major producers, Origin Energy, Santos, BG Group and Arrow Energy, have had drilling disrupted but say they continue to meet demand.
Drilling contractors Savanna Energy and Easternwell have reported damaged, and in some cases, non-operational rigs.
There are concerns that the construction of multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas projects in Gladstone â€“ including BG's Queensland Curtis venture and Santos's newly approved GLNG project â€“ will be delayed.
 If you've got to drill hundreds of wells and the prime acreage is under water, you would think they'd inevitably face some delays,  says EnergyQuest chief executive Graeme Bethune.
Likely damage to pastoral property, access roads and other infrastructure such as evaporation ponds would all require repair work, Bethune says.
The extent of the damage and likely delays can't be determined yet as the sites are inaccessible, says Surat Basin Corporation general manager David Breese, who is based in Toowoomba.
 Just getting out of Toowoomba is an issue, so you couldn't do the logistics supply for the rigs and they need fuel, water, chemicals and the crews need food and water as well. With the roads as they are you can't drive between the major towns, let alone go off the highways. 
Breese says it may take between eight and 10 weeks before drilling companies start getting their operations back on track, given the work needed to repair roads that have to bear equipment weighing up to 40 tonnes.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The excitement around the approval of Santos' $US16 billion Gladstone liquefied natural gas development has been tempered by fresh concerns over the depth of the project's reserves base.
The formal go-ahead for GLNG was welcomed by analysts, with Credit Suisse and JPMorgan reaffirming their call of Santos as their preferred pick in the industry. But analysts at Merrill Lynch and Macquarie flagged concerns over whether Santos and its partners had sufficient gas reserves to underpin the project, despite Santos' assurances.
 In a major boost for Queensland's flood-ravaged economy, Santos and its partners in GLNG gave the green light to construction of the mammoth project on Thursday. Merrill Lynch analyst David Heard estimated Santos and its partners only had two-thirds of the  bare minimum  reserves required for a 20-year project, while Macquarie's Adrian Wood warned of  lingering resource uncertainty  at the project.
Santos and its partners have identified reserves of just over 5000 petajoules, with independent consultants expecting that figure to double ultimately.
Santos also plans to sell gas from its Cooper Basin operations in South Australia into GLNG, providing further depth to the project's resource base.
The flexibility to import gas from Santos' other operations in SA and NSW would not only shore up reserves, but leave GLNG better placed than rival developments to weather any repeat of the recent floods, Santos chief executive David Knox told The Weekend AFR.
 It's one of the strengths in the hand that we have,  Mr Knox said.  We've also got access to other parts of the Australian network and we have capacity in that network. 
GLNG will create 5000 jobs during its construction over the next four years and is the second coal seam gas-fed LNG project approved for development in the state after BG Group's $US15Â billion Queensland Curtis LNG project.
The Australia Pacific (APLNG) joint venture of Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips is due to be approved later this year, while Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina have plans for a similar project.
Given each development is expected to have a minimum operating life of 20 years, there is a likelihood that the projects will be subject to flooding catastrophes in the future.
Production from Santos's existing coal seam gas wells has not been affected by the flooding, although it and other coal seam gas companies have had to halt exploration and field development work due to access issues.
Santos's key Queensland gas fields, Fairview and Arcadia, are situated on elevated ground that has avoided the flooding.
In contrast, both BG and the APLNG partners have reportedly sustained rig damage at some of their comparatively lower-ground acreage.
 Despite all the heavy rain that we've had, we've continued production from our current fields,  Mr Knox said.
 They will be the fields that will underpin our project. This demonstrates we're able to operate even in these quite severe conditions. 
Santos owns 30 per cent of GLNG, with Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total owning 27.5Â per cent each and Korea Gas owning 15 per cent.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"LNG: Eastern Star Gas has committed to the $22.5 million purchase of land in Newcastle harbour as it proceeds with plans for a $1 billion coal seam gas-fired LNG plant.
The Sydney-based company said the arrangements for the purchase of the site on Kooragang Island became unconditional on Saturday.
 Managing director David Casey said the completion of the land purchase reflected the company's confidence in the LNG project in Newcastle. Eastern Star plans to approve a front-end engineering and design study within the next few weeks.
This follows a feasibility study that showed a Newcastle plant would be more than cost-competitive compared with the big coal-seam gas-to-LNG plants being built on the east coast.
Under a joint venture with Hitachi and Toyo, Eastern Star is planning to commit to development of the Newcastle plant around the end of the year and to start exporting liquefied natural gas by 2015, as opposed to an earlier target of 2014.
The partners are planning a 1 million tonne-a-year LNG plant that could be expanded in 500,000-tonne-a-year lots to a maximum of 4 million tonnes.
Mr Casey said he planned to go ahead with the project although major shareholder and gas joint venture partner Santos has said it is not keen to build at Newcastle.

EASTERN Star Gas says it expects to lodge initial details within weeks with the NSW Department of Planning for a proposed coal seam gas export terminal in Newcastle, as it finalises the purchase of 24 hectares at Kooragang.
 In a statement to the stock exchange yesterday, the company said payment of the final balance of $22.5 million for the land it was buying from Incitec Pivot would be made late next month. An option for Eastern Star to opt out of the sale lapsed on Friday.
Under the proposal, worth up to $2.5 billion if fully developed and including a pipeline to the site, coal seam gas from Narrabri would be exported through an electric motor-driven mid-scale plant.
The company is collaborating with Japan's Hitachi and Toyo on the project and hopes to begin work at the end of the year, with the first export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as early as 2015.
Managing director David Casey said the completion of the sale reflected the company's confidence in the LNG Newcastle project with a number of important milestones now realised.
He said a feasibility study of the Kooragang site was finished late last year with favourable outcomes.
Engineering and design work would begin within the next few weeks and a preliminary environmental assessment would be lodged soon.
 Forecast project costs are well and truly competitive with industry best practice, while the size and operational flexibility of the project are ideally suited for supply from an upstream coal seam gas project,  Mr Casey said.
Chief commercial officer Roland Sleeman said discussions with Hunter Water, EnergyAustralia and the Newcastle Port Corporation had encouraged the company.
The port corporation had previously raised safety concerns about putting a gas project near potentially explosive fertiliser plants at the port.
A port corporation spokesman said  very preliminary  discussions about the site and a potential terminal berth were ongoing.

CANBTZ,Canberra Times,2011,1,"A n African resources boom is under way, reminiscent of the 19th- century gold rushes. ASX-listed Australian miners and explorers are heavily involved and their share prices are soaring a bubble could be developing. Last week, Stirling Minerals (ASX code: SMZ) changed its name to African Iron Ore (AKI) and its share price shot up 125per cent from 20c to 45c as Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan have bought in. Since then it has dropped to 40c. While the 19th-century Californian, Alaskan and Victorian gold rushes are history, today's African resource rush is in exotic places such as the Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Eritrea and to the south Botswana, Tanzania and South Africa. These companies are searching for gold, other precious metals, coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, lead, tin, manganese, oil and natural gas. Keep in mind that any investment in the stocks mentioned in this week's column are the icing on a speculative investor's cake.
  Even for such investors no more than 10per cent of their portfolio should be invested in African fireflies. On September 8 last year, this column recommended Botswana copper and now manganese explorer, shortly to become a miner, Discovery Metals (DML) at 90c and it has recently hit $1.40: a 55per cent rise. On October 6, Ghana-based gold miner Adamus Resources (ADU) was recommended at 61c and has hit 82c, and Chalice Gold Mines (CHN) in Eritrea was at 66c and now has traded above 70c. Other Australians in Africa include aspiring coal miners Coal of Africa (CZA), Continental Coal (CCC), ZYL Ltd (ZYL), African Energy (AFR) and Atomic Energy (ATQ). In southern Africa new mines have caused an energy crisis. Your columnist is a modest investor in some of these stocks and follows their share prices, up or down, with a 15-20 per cent
floating stop loss strategy. Despite such small personal punts it seems difficult to understand why Australian miners and their investors would risk big money, perhaps even their lives, in such exotic locations. In June last year, the board of Sundance Resources (SDL) died in a plane crash in Congo. Africa is underexplored compared to Australia and this is the main reason for the rush, but there is a powerful secondary reason that seems suspect. Rio Tinto has extensive investments in some unstable African nations and yet Tom Albanese, Rio chief executive has warned that Australia represents Rio's greatest sovereign risk!
The investment world listens to the head of the world's third largest miner. Also international investors are aware, according to various sovereign world risk surveys, that Australia rates behind quite a few African nations, including Botswana and Ghana, in terms of political risk. This is patently ridiculous. At present in the Ivory Coast incumbent leader, Laurent Gbagbo, who lost the recent election supported by the army, refuses to step down. It is impossible to imagine this in Australia. One wonders if Ian Smith, Newcrest Mining's chief executive, who has recently closed his company's mine at Bonikro in the Ivory Coast, and then relocated
mine management to Accra in Ghana, would agree with Albanese? I worked in the Southern Sudan near Tong, in the Bar el Gazal region, not far from the borders with the Congo and Central African Republic, more years ago than I like to remember.

CONCERNS about the potential impact of the coal-seam gas industry on agriculture in the Northern Rivers will be discussed at a special meeting next month.
 Coal-seam gas is already a big industry in Queensland.
Now, mining companies are turning to NSW â€“ including the Clarence-Moreton Basin which runs from south of Grafton up to the Queensland border â€“ with the promise of a new industry that will create energy and jobs.
According to the Environmental Defender's Office education officer Mark Byrne, some land-owners are happy to have exploration or production wells drilled on their land, but it may not be all good news.
â€œThere have been problems in Queensland with the amount of waste water produced from the wells and the media have reported community concerns about the potential contamination of ground water from the chemicals used in â€˜fracking' or hydraulic fracturing wells,â€? Mr Byrne said.
â€œWhile the companies exploring in our area point out that the situation here is far different to Queensland, we've had calls from locals who are still concerned, especially when exploration wells appear on land near their homes and they say they haven't been informed in advance.
â€œSome people are also concerned about such things as the potential for chemicals to contaminate drinking water, how waste water will bedisposed of, truck movements and the air quality.
â€œBut it's important to bear in mind that only one well has beenapproved for fracking.
â€œAlso, the public will have a chance to comment on any new gas production projects before the government approves them.
â€œOne of the biggest problems is that the industry is so new and there is so little experience with this kind of mining in Australia, generally, that everyone is learning as they go â€“ including the miners.â€?

Metgasco has approval to build a 30-megawatt power station just outside Casino and also plans to pipe gas from the region into south-east Queensland.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Woodside Petroleum's 20 per cent increase in full-year revenues was overshadowed yesterday by news of the failure of an exploration well, which leaves the company still hunting enough reserves to underpin an expansion of its Pluto liquefied natural gas project.
Woodside in November reported a discovery at its Remy well in the Greater Pluto area off the north-west coast, but yesterday revealed its Moyet-1 well in the same permit came up dry.
 All eyes are now on the Martin-1 well, also in the WA-404-P licence, where Woodside bought out partner Hess in October.
No other wells are due to be drilled this quarter in the Pluto area and Woodside yesterday had no progress to report on talks with third parties on gas supplies.
Woodside is targeting a final investment decision (FID) this year on the Pluto-2 expansion project after delaying the decision from last year. It said yesterday it still plans to order long-lead items this year for Pluto-2 to maintain the end of 2014 as the potential earliest start-up date.
 The key question for investors is 'will Woodside successfully complete FID on Pluto train 2 this year?',  said Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge.  The intention to purchase long-lead items continues to signify confidence that they can pull this off. 
Woodside had been due to drill appraisal wells in the key WA-404-P block this quarter but the Ocean America drill rig has been sent to Singapore for repairs.
Woodside yesterday reported record production last year from the North West Shelf venture and higher oil and gas prices, helping drive up full-year sales to $4.19 billion from $3.49 billion in 2009, despite a 10 per cent output drop.
The figures were roughly in line with analysts' expectations.
Production of 72.7 million barrels of oil equivalent topped the mid-point of Woodside's guidance of 70-75 million boe.
Woodside confirmed August as the start-up date for the first train at Pluto, as per its revised schedule announced in November, and maintained its 2011 output forecast at 63-66 million boe, plus 5-9 million boe from Pluto.

WOODSIDE Petroleum has reported a 20 per cent gain in full-year revenue as rising oil and gas prices, and the renegotiation of North West Shelf liquefied natural gas contracts, offset a drop in production.
 In its fourth-quarter report yesterday, Woodside logged $US1.058 billion ($1.055bn) of sales, in line with expectations and just up on the previous quarter's $US1.033bn. Full-year revenue was $US4.193bn, up from $US3.487bn in 2009, despite a 10 per cent drop in full-year sales volumes to 72.7 million barrels of oil equivalent.
The production drop was blamed on the sale of the Otway Gas project and natural field decline, and came despite the North West Shelf having record quarterly and annual LNG production.
The biggest driver of the revenue increase was the North West Shelf, where Woodside's full-year LNG sales jumped 70 per cent to $US1.31bn, despite only an 8 per cent jump in output.
Price negotiations with Japanese customers are understood to have been a major factor in pushing the average price of the North West Shelf's LNG from $US5.81 a gigajoule in 2009 to $US9.13.
Oil prices averaged $US79.41 a barrel last year, up from $US61.66 in 2009.
Woodside made no change to its forecast for an August start-up of the $14bn first stage of the Pluto LNG project.
The company also said it was still targeting first LNG from the long-awaited Pluto expansion in 2014, a timetable Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said would require a 2011 final investment decision.
Woodside's fortunes are to some extent tied to when it can approve an expansion of Pluto with a second train, a target it had hoped to achieve last year.
A second train will improve the economics of the project, because it will require less new infrastructure.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"CHEVRON PERTH, Jan 25 AAP - Chevron Corporation's Australian arm has sealed a liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric Power Company for a portion of product from the huge Gorgon project in Western Australia.
The US energy giant said in a statement late on Monday that Kyushu had agreed to buy 300,000 tonnes per annum of LNG from the $43 billion Gorgon project for up to 20 years beginning in 2015.
 Kyushu and Chevron have existing agreements regarding LNG and equity sales from Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project, also in WA.
Chevron Global Gas president John Gass said the company looked forward to expanding its relationship with Kyushu in the future.
Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Company president Jim Blackwell said Gorgon was on track to produce first gas in 2014, while a final investment decision on Wheatstone was expected this year.
The initial Gorgon development on Barrow Island will include a three train, 15 million tonnes per annum LNG processing facility and a domestic gas plant.
Chevron has an interest of about 47 per cent in Gorgon, which has been under construction for more than a year.
ExxonMobil and Shell each hold a 25 per cent stake in the joint venture.
Chevron in December signed a sale deal for gas from Gorgon with Japan's Chubu Electric, which also has a 0.417 per cent stake in the project.
Other parties signed up as Gorgon customers are Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and GS Caltex, while a heads of agreement has been signed with Korea Gas Corporation.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"BALLINA Shire Council should support a moratorium on coal seam gas mining in NSW, Councillor Jeff Johnson said.
The NSW Farmers Association has called for the moratorium amid concerns about the environmental impact from drilling and extraction, particularly the risk posed to farmland and water resources.
 On Thursday, Cr Johnson will ask his fellow councillors to offer their support to the farming industry.
â€œI fully support the association until an independent environmental assessment has been carried out on the methods and chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing,â€? he said.
â€œThe risks posed to our local environment and water table are too high to allow more wells to be approved.â€?
Cr Johnson also wants the council to write to the Premier, the Minister for Environment and Climate Change, the Leader of the Opposition, the Shadow Environment Minister and local MPs to â€œstrongly urge a moratoriumâ€?.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"East Timor has launched a fresh attack on Woodside Petroleum over the proposed $US8.6 billion Greater Sunrise floating liquefied natural gas project by claiming the Perth-based producer has been forced to halt work on the development due to licensing issues.
In a statement released on Monday, East Timor spokesman Agio Pereira said Woodside could conduct upstream drilling and exploration but did not hold the rights to conduct processing or downstream activities under the Timor Sea Treaty.
  Therefore, neither Woodside nor regulators will proceed with the proposals until the downstream title issue is resolved,  said Mr Pereira.  This effectively means that Woodside's operations on Greater Sunrise have been suspended. 
He added that the Sunrise Commission (which represents the East Timor and Australian governments) asked the relevant regulatory bodies to cease evaluating Woodside's development proposals on December 16.
East Timor and Woodside have been embroiled in a dispute over the best strategy for developing Sunrise, one portion of which sits in a joint development area controlled by the Australian and East Timorese governments.
East Timor has previously vowed not to authorise any development that does not involve processing facilities in East Timor; while Woodside and its partners last year chose floating LNG processing as the best method to develop the project.
Woodside declined to comment on the latest statement.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"When Perth software developer Eugen Walcher was a kid growing up in the mining town of Karratha, Australia Day meant throwing a Â­couple of snags on the family's barbie. The cut-down 44-gallon drum barbecue â€“ wood-fired with an iron plate on it â€“ resulted in  many a burnt sausage .
These days Walcher is the master of his own barbecue. It's a six-burner, natural gas Everdure outdoor kitchen with a built-in sink and sewerage system, made from Tasmanian oak with Stratco corrugated sheeting.  We were going to render it but then thought, 'we'll get the mini-orb' [sheeting],  he says. The barbecue, which he built himself, took four months to complete and cost almost $8000. It even has a built-in wood-fired pizza oven.  It was 100 per cent worth it. I wouldn't have it any other way,  he says.
 Australians love a good barbie. But this Australia Day, as folks gather round to share a few cold ones, the focus will be as much on the Â­machinery as on the food.
Barbecues are bigger and sturdier than ever and we are spending more money on installing them. The Torero outdoor kitchen from Matador barbecue suppliers costs $1399 and features a satin enamel-coated hotplate and grill, four stainless-steel burners, built-in sink and tap. The Ultimate Entertainer, which  could mean you never cook indoors again , according to the website, comes with a cast iron enamel hotplate, six stainless steel burners and a granite bench top. It sells for $2699.
The owner of Kamado Cookers Australia in Queensland, Michael Jones, has sold hundreds of his 85-kiloÂ­gram charcoal cookers in the past year. The Japanese-inspired cookers are  a barbecue and oven in one , he says.
Sydney is his top market but he has sold them to buyers as far away as Broken Hill, and Kununurra in Â­WA.  The thing about charcoal cooking is it creates a lot of flavour in your food,  he says. No one wants fatty bangers any more and with the cooker fat drops into the coal,  so it's fat-free cooking .
He says Australians are moving away from simple snags and steaks. They cook pizza on the barbie and experiment with wood chips for smoky-flavoured meat and roasts. The big thing this Australia Day will be butter-fried lamb with garlic, olive oil and lemon juice, says Jones.
As for Walcher, he'll be cooking steak, asparagus, corn, chops and Â­garlic prawns on his beast.
But when it comes to Australia Day, there's only one chef in the house.  Most of my good mates know that I'm the one in control of the barbecue.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Westpac's money man says mining will pull the dollar out of its post-flood doldrums, writes Pip Freebairn.
Offshore investors have gone cold on the Australian dollar in 2011, as they worry China's policy tightening and the Queensland floods will hit the domestic economy hard and end the good times. But one strategist says such fears are misplaced and they are forgetting key developments in the Australian economy, not least of which is the expansion of the country's liquid natural gas industry, that will boost the economy and support the dollar.
 Westpac Banking Group chief currency strategist Rob Rennie said  the offshore investor community jumped on the flood and said, 'This is it. This is the beginning of the end',  he said.  But we do not share those views. 
The $A has fallen about 3.3 per cent against the greenback in the first few weeks of 2011, the second-worst performance among major-traded currencies. It has fared even worse against the euro, having fallen 4.7 per cent and against sterling, against which it is down 5.5 per cent.
But these investors are ignoring an  enormous change  taking place in Australian resource exports that will involve huge increases in mining investment and associated inflation pressures, namely the expansion of the liquid natural gas industry, Mr Rennie said.
The Chinese were moving to more environmentally cleaner gas, which would boost mining investment in Australia in the area for several years, and turn the country into a large energy exporter, he said.
The $50 billion Gorgon project, which was set to start shipping gas in 2014 was just the start of a  boom  that would fuel growth in the Australian economy through mining investment, he said.
 Once you get Gorgon kicking in, our LNG exports will double by 2014-15, and could double again by 2017-18. 
But there has been a recent larger wave of projects approved which could boost the outlook for the economy and support the currency.
 The recent environmental approval of the $16 billion Queensland Curtis project, the $10 billion Gladstone coal seam gas (CSG)-LNG project and the $35 billion Australia Pacific CSG-LNG project in Queensland marks the beginning of the second wave in this industry,  he said.
 You know the RBA is watching these massive waves of investment. 
The investments will lead to even greater strains on Australia capacity, and see the east and west of the country competing for skilled labour to undertake the projects. He believes this will put upward pressure on the inflation outlook, and implies that the current market pricing for only about one interest rate rise in 2011 is too modest.
Any concerns Chinese authorities might tighten policy in their economy too far and kill demand for the gas were unfounded, he said.
 China is building port storages across the eastern seaboard that have more storage than Australia will be able to produce. There will be a tenfold increase in Chinese port storage projects as a base minimum. 
On Friday, the Shanghai Securities News reported the Chinese government planned to increase demand to more greener energy sources to 260 billion cubic metres annually by 2015, or by 25 per cent annually. China may import 90Â billion cu m of natural gas by 2015, according to the newspaper, compared to the 12.2 billion cu m of imports.
But this does not imply the $A trajectory is up from here because there may be a short period of weakness in the currency as the flood-affected economic data is released and scares investors. But Mr Rennie said the currency would be a buy especially at about the US96Â¢ level. He expects it to trade in a range of US95Â¢ to $US1.05 in 2011.
 Short-term, we've got the downside risks for the $A as the offshore community will believe softer data more than they believe firmer data,  Mr Rennie said.
 But once we get to the point where we are pricing in modest rate cuts in Australia, you know that's the point you really want to bet against it. Especially in [the June quarter], and into [the September quarter], that's the trade â€“ you go against the market if it's pricing in cuts. 
Investors have moved to consider the prospect the Reserve Bank may be forced to cut interest rates as the flood affects the economy. On Monday, traders put a 3 per cent chance on a quarter of a percentage point interest rate cut at the February meeting.
But there are a growing number of strategists who disagree with Westpac's positive outlook on the currency.
UBS economists Scott Haslem and George Tharenou said on Friday they expected the currency to trade down to US93Â¢ by the end of 2011.
The currency traded at a post-record high of $US1.0256 on December 31.
In the pipeline
 Short term, we have the downside risks for the $A as offshore investors will believe softer data more than they believe firmer data. But once we get to the point where we are pricing in cuts, weâ€™ve gone too far.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"CHEVRON last night signed a multi-billion-dollar binding agreement with Japan's Kyushu Electric to supply liquefied natural gas from its $43 billion Gorgon projects in Western Australia from 2015.
In another major boost to the massive jobs-generating project, Chevron said Kyushu had agreed to receive 300,000 tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years from the Gorgon project, where construction began last year.
 The deal was formalised after a heads of agreement was signed about a year ago.
It comes on top of the $500bn in Australian LNG sales to Asian buyers under long-term contracts over the past two years, including $200bn from Gorgon alone.
However, the Kyushu deal is worth far less in monetary terms than ExxonMobil's sale of $50bn worth of its share of Gorgon LNG to PetroChina in 2009 and BG Group's agreement that year to sell gas to China's CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Corporation) from its Queensland LNG project, a contract worth up to $80bn.
In addition to the Gorgon deal, Chevron last year signed a heads of agreement with Kyushu for LNG supply and equity sales from its planned Wheatstone project, near Onslow in WA, where a final investment decision is due later this year.
Under that deal, which has yet to be turned into a binding agreement, Kyushu will take 700,000 tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years from Wheatstone.
It will also take a 1.83 per cent stake in Chevron's share of the Wheatstone project and a 1.37 per cent interest in the planned LNG plant.
``Both the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects are positioned to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the Asia-Pacific region,'' said Jim Blackwell, Chevron Asia-Pacific exploration and production company president, last night.
``Gorgon is more than a year into construction and remains on track to produce first gas in 2014.
``We expect to make a final investment decision on Wheatstone in 2011.''
Chevron Global Gas president John Gass said: ``We are pleased to have reached this milestone with Kyushu Electric, one of the leading companies in the world's largest LNG market, and we look forward to expanding this relationship in the future.''
Chevron is the operator of the Gorgon Project and has a 47 per cent interest.
The company has a 75 per cent stake in Wheatstone.
The Gorgon project will include a three-train, 15 million tonnes a year LNG facility and a domestic gas plant.
There has been growing speculation recently that Gorgon, which is 16 months into a five-year construction period, is running late, along with a spate of delays and cost blowouts among other mega-projects.
Operator Chevron is overseeing one of the biggest logistics exercises by a private sector entity and has had to rearrange the timing of much of the work.
Services provider AJ Lucas told the stock exchange earlier this month that it had not been able to start drilling that was supposed to begin last July.
Some contractors have blamed the delays on problems with insufficient wharf facilities and staff accommodation, along with extensive quarantine procedures needed to access the island. But Chevron insists it is on track for a 2014 start.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"OIL Search has beaten full-year production and cost guidance at its Papua New Guinean operations but has flagged a drop in production this year as it shuts down some production for construction of the $US15 billion ($14.96bn) PNG Liquefied Natural Gas project.
Production last year was 7.66 million barrels of oil equivalent, beating the guidance range of between 7.2mboe and 7.4mboe.
 Costs, to be released next month with full-year earnings, were also expected to be slightly below previous guidance, Oil Search managing director Peter Botten said.
This year, production is expected to drop as much as 20 per cent to between 6.2mboe and 6.7mboe.
``While underlying field performance remains strong, output will be impacted by a planned shut-in of facilities in the second and fourth quarters of 2011 to enable associated gas work related to the PNG LNG project to occur,'' Mr Botten said.
``Production is likely to be slightly above this level in 2012 and then remain largely flat into 2013, assuming planned future development activities are successful.''
Oil Search said the PNG LNG project, which is operated by ExxonMobil, was still on track for a 2014 start-up.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said this year was a key one for the project. Major construction would begin and about 30 per cent of development costs would be spent.
Full-year revenue jumped 15 per cent to $US557 million, as average realised oil prices rose from $US65.39 to $US80.19 a barrel.
An appraisal program at the Hides field, due to start in the second quarter, could underpin a third LNG train at the project, Mr Hirjee said. ``The upside potential from expansion at PNG LNG and leverage to US dollar-denominated oil prices keep us on a buy rating,'' he said.
Oil Search has also acquired offshore Papuan Gulf acreage, where drilling is due to start late this year.
``The area is believed to have the potential to be the basis for a new LNG growth stream for the company,'' Mr Botten said.
Oil Search shares slipped 2c to $6.75 yesterday.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The reinvention of oil and gas play Victoria Petroleum looks set to accelerate today when the company releases a reserve statement for its Queensland coal seam gas acreage.
The reserve figure should help VicPet in its efforts to monetise the assets, and managing director Ian Davies is likely to step up his efforts either to sell the interests or find a new partner.
 VicPet, soon to be renamed Senex Energy, holds a 30 per cent interest in ATP 574P and 20 per cent in PL 171, operated by BG Group.
Today's figure is likely to be only the start, with VicPet and BG committing to spend $71 million on drilling at the permits this year.
As far as monetisation goes, VicPet has several options.
The simplest path would be to sell the stake to BG, a matter that could be hastened by any move by BG to add a third processing train to its under-construction Curtis liquefied natural gas project. Such a decision is said to be only a matter of time. Of course, the much bigger BG may feel it has a lot more control and authority over the much smaller VicPet â€“- conditions not conducive to a generous deal for the latter. One way VicPet could prevent being pushed around by BG would be to bring in a bigger partner. The Asian parties already active in Queensland, such as Japan's Toyota Tsusho and BG's partners CNOOC of China and Tokyo Gas, would all be keeping a close eye on VicPet's stake. In addition to bringing on board a big brother with clout, any deal would provide a healthy see-through value on VicPet's remaining stake.
Domestic interest is also not out of the question. Origin Energy and AGL Energy both have gas-fired power stations they need to feed, while Santos could use some more gas to help shore up reserves for its recently approved Gladstone LNG project.
With acquisitions generally being made at 90Â¢ to $1.30 per gigajoule of 2P (proven plus probable) gas, investors will be able to get a better handle on the value of VicPet's coal-seam gas assets when armed with the reserve statement.
VicPet, which has oil fields in the Cooper Basin, also owns 20 per cent of Impress Energy, the subject of a takeover bid from Beach Energy.
An acceptance from VicPet would all but assure Beach of taking 100 per cent of Impress. To date VicPet has resisted the offer, but it has not definitively ruled out accepting the bid, giving some hope of a possible change of heart at some stage before the offer's close next month.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"LNG SYDNEY, Jan 28 AAP - Shares in Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd (LNG) are up over 10 per cent as the company confirmed it has agreed to sell a 20 per cent stake to Chinese state-owned oil and gas giant CNPC for around $25.6 million.
LNG says CNPC subsidiary, China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation (HQCEC), would become LNG's largest shareholder after the purchase of the 19.9 per cent stake.
 Under the deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals, HQCEC would purchase 53.25 million shares in LNG for the lesser of 48 cents per share or 80 per cent of the volume weighted average market price over the five days before the shares are issued.
LNG says it would apply the proceeds to development of the company's three million tonne per annum LNG project at Fisherman's Landing, near Gladstone in Central Queensland.
Shares in LNG had jumped 10.92 per cent by 1035 AEDT, to 65.5 cents, after coming out of a trading halt that had been in place since Thursday morning.
A HQCEC nominee would be appointed as an executive director of the company and co-chief executive officer with LNG chief executive Maurice Brand.
Mr Brand said the two companies would work together to deliver Gladstone LNG.
 The appointment of a HQCEC nominated executive director and co-CEO will allow the company to liaise with and access the significant global resources of HQCEC and the CNPC group which will materially assist LNG Ltd to progress its current project portfolio and target a number of new LNG project opportunities,  Mr Brand said in a statement.
CNPC said in a statement, released in China overnight, that the agreement would give HQCEC preferential rights to use the Australian firm's liquefied natural gas technology, which would help it become more competitive in the international LNG market.
It would also help CNPC develop its position in the Australian natural gas market, it said.
LNG chairman Richard Beresford said the investment by HQCEC was a  vote of confidence  in the company's OSMR process technology.
Chinese firms have made a series of bids for Australian resources, including Yanzhou Coal's $A3.5 billion takeover of miner Felix in 2009, the biggest for an Australian company by a Chinese firm.
The deal is dependent on HQCEC obtaining relevant approvals from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, China's Ministry of Commerce and National Economic Reform Commission and CNPC.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"COUGAR MELBOURNE, Jan 28 AAP - The Queensland government may be killing off a new gas industry by forcing Cougar Energy Ltd to shelve its trial underground coal gasification (UCG) plant, an analyst says.
Cougar Energy, which uses UCG technology to create natural gas, was told late on Thursday the Queensland government had shelved the company's trial plant in the state's southeast.
 The trial was suspended in July 2010 because traces of the cancer-causing chemical benzene and other substances were found in groundwater monitoring bores on the site.
Queensland Environment Minister Kate Jones on Friday said Cougar Energy had failed to prove its UCG trial near Kingaroy was environmentally safe.
 The only activity that Cougar will be authorised to undertake in the future is the full rehabilitation of the site,  Ms Jones said in a statement.
Patersons Securities coal analyst Andrew Harrington said it appeared the government was holding miners to a higher standard than farmers.
 It looks like they (the Queensland government) is going to kill the (UCG) industry, forego cheap energy and forego the royalties,  Mr Harrington said.
 The government has fallen on the side of the farmers, as opposed to miners, despite the many alterations to the land they (farmers) do, which go unnoticed and unpunished.
 They are allowed to clear the land and they are allowed to operate heavy machinery and use unfriendly chemicals without any serious regulation across what they can do. 
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said while Cougar would not be able to proceed, two other UCG trials would still go ahead.
 We won't make a decision on that technology until we see the outcome of those trials,  she said.
Shares in two other companies that use UCG technology in Queensland - Carbon Energy Ltd and Linc Energy Ltd - fell heavily in early trade on Friday.
Cougar was placed in a trading halt.
Ms Jones said a report into Linc Energy's trial plant near Chinchilla recommended that operation continue as planned and said the company was able to demonstrate a significant technical capacity.
She said her department had not finalised its investigations into Carbon Energy's plant at Kogan and an environmental protection order preventing further gasification at the plant would remain in place.
At 1422 AEDT, Carbon was down 6.8 per cent at 34.5 cents, while Linc was off 7.4 per cent at $2.38.
Intelligent Investor resources analyst Gaurav Sodhi said he wasn't sure there was a need for companies to produce natural gas from UCG operations.

 The agreement involves the sale of up to 19 cargoes to ALTCO through to 2014,  Woodside said.
 This LNG supply agreement is in addition to the existing LNG sale and purchase agreements with foundation customers Kansai Electric and Tokyo Gas. 
Shares in Woodside were down 56 cents, or 1.31 per cent, at $42.05 at 1438 AEDT.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"ORIGIN Energy's Australia-Pacific LNG project at Gladstone remains in talks with liquefied natural gas buyers to underpin a final investment decision, despite the Gillard government delaying a decision on the project until late next month.
Last month, The Australian revealed that Origin and its 50-50 partner in APLNG, ConocoPhillips, were in talks with Sinopec and Thailand's PTT to sell stakes in the project and offtake.
 Yesterday, ConocoPhillips indicated there were more possible buyers. ``APLNG is engaged with several potential LNG buyers in support of leading that project to a final investment decision,'' chief financial officer Jeff Sheets told investors in an earnings conference call.
Three months earlier, ConocoPhillips chief executive Jim Mulva said he had hoped to have a supply deal to underpin two LNG production trains signed by the end of last year. That timing was scotched when the Gillard government delayed an expected approval of the project from before Christmas to February 22.
It is believed Environment Minister Tony Burke remains on track for that date. APLNG is proposing a 9 million-tonne-a-year project in one hit, through two trains, which would make it the biggest of the three big planned LNG plants at Gladstone.
If APLNG can sell 9 million tonnes a year of LNG in one hit, as hinted at by Mr Mulva, it would be the biggest LNG deal done in one go in Australia -- worth about $150 billion -- and one of the biggest in the world.
APLNG was not the only Gladstone LNG hopeful talking up deals with customers yesterday.
LNG Limited, which owns the small Fisherman's Landing project and is negotiating gas supplies, went into a trading halt pending a share placement and an announcement on a strategic partner. The deal is reportedly with state-owned giant China National Petroleum Co.
If this is the case, it would be an interesting twist, as CNPC is the parent company of PetroChina.
The latter is in a 50-50 joint venture with Shell, which acquired Arrow Energy, and in doing so robbed LNG Limited of potential gas supply.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"When a team of 40 Brisbane-based Freehills lawyers were working around the clock to finish advising Santos on the approval of the $US16 billion Gladstone liquid natural gas project in mid-January, the last thing they needed was to be evacuated in the midst of one of the worst floods in Queensland's history.
Michael Back, the partner in charge of Freehills' Brisbane office, had been watching the team's workload rise steadily in the weeks immediately before and after Christmas, to the point where they were doing  very lengthy, all night meetings  by Monday, January 10.
 But when it became clear that the legal precinct near the banks of theÂ Brisbane River was going to flood, Back and lead deal partners Matthew FitzGerald and Jay Leary had to decide how to keep the team working at full steam during a natural disaster.
 We thought we would be able to move them to a hotel in town where we had secured meeting rooms, and set up the IT support they would need, and even accommodation. But it worked out that it was going to be more efficient for the transaction to actually relocate the whole deal team to our Sydney office,  Back says.
 By 9am the next morning, Wednesday morning, they were up and running in Sydney. 
Santos formally approved the deal the following Thursday, making it all the more crucial for the deal team to remain focused at a time when some homes of partners and support staff were about to be inundated.
Back says it was extremely difficult balancing the need to get the high-stakes work finished with the fear, sadness and stress staff were feeling. One secretary was working all hours on the transaction right when her West End home was being threatened, and a few partners were anxious their houses would be swamped in the lower-lying New Farm area.
 There were two guys who were really at the heart of the transaction and they just couldn't leave,  Back says,  but they had families in an area where we were hearingÂ announcements there would be flooding. 
The plight of the deal team is just one example of the difficulty many Brisbane-based firms faced keeping their businesses going in the midst of power cuts, office closures and severe threats to family homes.
A host of large firms with offices near the Brisbane River triggered business continuity plans at short notice, setting up temporary offices, opening remote email and database access for staff sent home and sending messages via SMS.
The absence of hard copies of crucial documents was one problem that threatened to derail vital work.
Allens Arthur Robinson partner Ren Niemann and several other staff climbed 30 storeys of the Riverside Centre with backpacks and headlamps last week to recover client files that were needed urgently, a task made more gruelling by the lack of air-conditioning and ventilation.
 In the 13 years I've been at Allens â€“ and this is probably a bad indictment on me as a partner â€“ I've never actually done the walk down as a fire drill. And it took a flood for me to walk up it,  he says.  One of the security guys is a fitness fanatic and he was pounding the stairs like there was no tomorrow. I got to about the 15th floor and said: 'Mate, we are going to have to slow the pace down, because I can't keep up with you'. 
Like other firms, Allens evacuated its staff on January 11 but moved to a temporary office at Sofitel Hotel in the CBD, complete with IT support, client meeting rooms and a makeshift reception desk. It was from this temporary base that partners collected a list of crucial documents â€“ including property settlement contracts and litigation files â€“ for the salvage team to pick up.
Blake Dawson's Brisbane practice leader Ian Humphreys says some of his staff were sent up the same stairwell to the firm's 40th-floor offices to recover documents last week. The firm was under pressure to close a major transaction for a client purchaser in the coal industry between evacuation on January 11 and the firm's return to the Riverside Centre on Monday.
 The heavens opened but the deal still had to be done,  he says.  And very pleasingly, our corporate and commercial team were able to conclude that deal in very challenging circumstances.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Perth-based energy junior Liquefied Natural Gas is on the verge of a landmark deal with a subsidiary of Chinese energy major China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) that could revive the stalled Fisherman's Landing LNG project in Queensland.
It is understood LNG Ltd is preparing to sign a deal as early as Friday morning today that will see China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation â€“ a technology-focused subsidiary of CNPC â€“ taking a 19.9 per cent stake in the company for around $23 million.
 As revealed by Resources Daily yesterday, the Chinese group will take a seat on the board of LNG Ltd and provide a senior executive in a full-time management role.
In addition to the funding, the calibre and expertise of China Huanqiu is likely to go a long way to resurrecting Fisherman's Landing.
While the looming deal is not believed to explicitly involve a commitment to buy LNG produced from Fisherman's Landing, the partner is likely to consider offtake from the project in the future.
The deal could also put LNG Ltd, which entered a trading halt yesterday, in a strong position to attract gas supplies to the project.
Last year the energy firm was working with Arrow Energy to develop a small-scale plant at Fisherman's Landing fed with coal seam gas from Arrow's Queensland acreage. However, that alliance fell apart after international energy giants Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina launched a $3.4 billion takeover bid for Arrow.
LNG Ltd then tried unsuccessfully to revive the Gladstone project with Bow Energy, before forming an agreement with gas explorer Metgasco to investigate transporting gas to its Gladstone plant, which already has most of its approvals in place. The partners were also looking at building a new LNG plant in Brisbane.

HOPES of a fifth liquefied natural gas project at Gladstone have received a boost after LNG Ltd announced it would sell a 20 per cent stake in the company to China National Petroleum Corporation for about $25.6 million.
 Shares in LNG soared about 12 per cent but fell back during trade yesterday to end the session 0.5Â¢ lower at 59Â¢.
Under the deal, China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation, a subsidiary of state-owned CNPC, China's largest oil and gas producer, has bought more than 53 million shares in LNG at 48Â¢ each. In return, HQCEC will appoint an executive director and co-chief executive as well as a non-executive director to the LNG board.
LNG chief executive Maurice Brand said the company was determined to proceed with its 3-million-tonne-a-year Fisherman's Landing LNG proposal. If LNG's proposal can be resurrected, it will make for a very busy port in Gladstone.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"Greens and residents call for an independent inquiry into the risks
AN independent inquiry is needed to decide whether mining companies can safely drill for coal seam gas without putting communities and their water supplies at risk, NSW Greens mining spokeswoman Cate Faehrmann has said.
 Addressing a group of Northern Rivers Greens members and residents at Keerrong yesterday, Ms Faehrmann said the coal seam gas industry was so new Australian governments did not yet fully understand how it worked or its environmental implications and was relying on the mining companies to tell them what constituted safe practice.
Lismore Greens candidate Susan Stock, speaking ahead of the meeting, said the bad experience of US communities with coal seam gas drilling, depicted in the documentary Gasland, meant Australian communities and governments should be taking a cautious approach to gas drilling, even if the companies operating within Australia were operating to a higher standard to those in the US.
Those concerns focused on â€˜fraccing' â€“ the process of fracturing rock to release trapped gas â€“ and around the types of chemicals used during the process and the potential impact on groundwater.
Even without the chemical content there were concerns aquifers containing fresh and salt water could be breached in a single drill shaft, spoiling the fresh water, and that released methane gas coulddissolve into water, making it flammable.
Keerrong residents have been expressing concern about the drilling since Arrow Energy drilled anexploratory shaft on the flood plain beneath their homes.
Arrow has said the drilling was done to meet activity requirements on its mining lease, but the company was focused on the Surat Basin and would not look seriously at the Northern Rivers for many years, and may never do serious drilling here.
Metgasco, which is drilling near Casino, has said it does not use the toxic chemicals highlighted in the Gasland documentary and makes a point of not drilling near aquifers.
Resident Janine O'Brien said the level of investment in exploratory drilling left her sceptical aboutArrow Energy's lack of interest in drilling on the Northern Rivers.
Setting up the exploratory drill site at Keerrong last year had involved the company building a weatherproof road through the property they were drilling on and building a new fence.
Ms Stock said she was concerned about the depth of some exploratory drilling, which she said went as deep as two kilometres under the ground and involved fraccing.
Ms Faehrmann said The Greens wanted a moratorium on drilling and an inquiry on its environmental, social, and economic impact.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"MAURICE Brand, Australia's most doggedly optimistic gas man, lobs back into Perth later today with just about everything he needs to finally get on with his long-planned and oft-scuttled Gladstone liquefied natural gas project.
Brand is chief executive of LNG Limited and he has spent the past few days in Beijing welding the mighty China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) to his dreams of building an innovative, boutique gas-to-liquids project in Gladstone's emerging energy export hub, Curtis Island.
 Brand left the Middle Kingdom last night with a new shareholder in LNG Ltd in the form of China Huanqui Contracting & Engineering Corporation. It is owned by CNPC, which is also the owner of PetroChina.
Brand also left believing he had a new financier and partner for his company's proposed Fisherman's Landing project and the firm potential
Continued on Page 40
Continued from Page 25
that in some form or another CNPC would become the customer for that plant's 3 million tonnes a year of output.
All Brand needs to do now is find some gas to freeze.
Unlike the other four consortiums working to build LNG projects on Curtis Island, LNG Ltd is not in the coal-seam gas (CSG) exploration and production game.
Brand is working to the Fields of Dreams theory: build it and they will come. The idea here is that LNG Ltd would deliver a project and Queensland's gas explorers would find and develop CSG and at some point the ambitions of each would meet.
And to be fair to Brand, for about two years he seemed to have his gas in the bag in the form of a brewing supply deal with Arrow Energy. Then along came Shell and its newest partner in Queensland CSG aspirations, PetroChina (which is now effectively double-dipping in Queensland CSG with this new alliance). Together the new and the old kings of global petroleum spent $3.5 billion to acquire Arrow in a move that solved the supply issues for the Shell-led Gladstone proposal, but which left Brand without a supplier.
Subsequently, Brand formed a supply and shareholder alliance with Metgasco and is understood to have at least attempted a similar sort of deal with another future CSG producer, Bow Energy.
But no one is convinced that either or both of them can deliver the volumes of gas needed to sustain the two-train, 3mtpa project Brand is entertaining.
Brand describes LNG's gas issue as a ``chicken and the egg for us''.
``Some of the big gas guys haven't wanted to talk to us because we didn't have the finance to get the deal done. Well, now we have a deal that will see a CNPC subsidiary provide the funds to build the plant and their involvement will mean that costs will be cheaper than they have had before. They are obvious interested in off-takes as well. And they have told us to go and breach the missing link which is the gas supply.
``As a box ticking exercise, this is pretty much as good as it gets. We have one box to go. But that isn't too bad, seeing we have been off the radar since June last year (when Arrow was taken out).''
Brand predicted that the ``next few months'' would see LNG Ltd ``aggressively trying to address the gas issue''.
Now there was some speculation that this deal, which will see China Inc appoint a co-chief executive of LNG Ltd, is part of Brand's exit strategy.
``No, no, no,'' Brand says.
``The fact is these guys want me around for another three years.''
The other interesting prospect here is that CNPC gets a call on its new partner's proprietary LNG technology, called the OSMR process.
``That was the original motivation for their contact with us,'' Brand says. ``They wanted to look at the technology. And we have negotiated a preferential right for them to use our technology on a global basis, a prospect that potentially delivers us a new revenue stream.''
We won't dull your Saturday morning with the technical details but suffice to say the difference in LNG Ltd's technology is that it is smaller scale and thus cheaper and faster to build and, given it all works as planned, cheaper to run.
So, where Santos expects to spend $US16bn building a twin train project that churns out 7.8mtpa of LNG, Brand is still talking about a capital cost of less than $900m for a plant that will produce 3mtpa from two 1.5mtpa trains.
Part of the difference here is that Brand's numbers don't account for any investment at all in the upstream gas. And it will cost maybe $500m or so to build the pipelines that connect his plant to his future suppliers, whoever they may be, and the best part of $1bn to get the gas out of the ground.
Nonetheless, the capex numbers are vastly different to the more traditional LNG projects and Brand says they will get lower, given the likelihood that HQCEC will provide a modular solution to his construction task.
Now, among the big-wind LNG players currently crowding Curtis Island, there remains considerable scepticism about the economies of Brand's project.
``We don't think the economics work, even though the capital employed is relatively light. In the end we reckon the margins will get squeezed by the gas providers and the off-takers,'' a competitor says. ``We see this as a $25m option over potential that remains uncertain. PetroChina isn't paying an awful lot to get a good look at LNG and its technology. And if it likes what it sees, well, with 19.9 per cent tied up and their own CEO inside the business, then they have a good platform to upside that opportunity.''
The fundamental standing between Brand and serious market credibility for his project is size, both of the project and of its operator. LNG Ltd is a $120m junior in the land of the giants.
To a degree, yesterday's deal solves that problem. Brand has delivered LNG Ltd with a giant of its own. But that will not be the end of the story here, even if Brand can secure his gas feed. The fact is that Gladstone looms as the likely epicentre of project cost inflation, not just in the LNG sector but in the whole resources sector.
In a startling, and frankly pretty scary, assessment of the current state of play in the LNG sector, Macquarie Research's senior oil and gas analyst, Adrian Wood, observed that Australian LNG already sits at the ``high end of the cost curve'' and yet ``we think cost blowouts of 25 per cent and higher are likely for some developments, which represents a significant risk given the scale of these projects.''
Wood wrote that the four biggest listed Australians in LNG, Woodside, Santos, Origin and Oil Search, currently plan to spend $64bn on expansion or new projects over the next six years.
The way Wood sees it, those four are relatively juniors in the LNG world and they might find it difficult to manage the risks implicit in the growth in the sector that he reckons could see project cost and schedules blowout by upwards of 25 per cent.
Now these are companies with a combined market capitalisation of $68bn and yet Macquarie reckons some might face material balance sheet pressure from the cost inflation expected from a growth push that will employ upwards of 50,000 people on new projects during the peak construction phase from 2013 to 2016.
Indian withdrawal
FINALLY, as we predicted, Team India has confirmed it will not attempt take on Rio Tinto in its $3.9bn pursuit of Riversdale Mining and its pair of coking coal monsters in Mozambique.
International Coal Ventures, a consortium of Indian state-owned companies, yesterday revealed it had taken a ``conscious decision not to bid'' for Riversdale -- a decision that clearly disappointed some of the gamblers in the market.
In a signal that the battle for Riversdale is over before it even really began, the coal developer's shares immediately shed 2.3 per cent, falling to $15.87.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"THE Papua New Guinea government and Exxon Mobil are struggling to resolve landowner issues that have shut down construction for more than a week for part of the $16 billion liquefied natural gas project in the Southern Highlands.
Oil Search has a 29 per cent stake in the project and Santos 13.5 per cent.
 The project, which has become the flagship for a massive resources boom throughout the country, is striking increasing problems in the Hides area.
The shutdown started with the death of a four-year-old boy who, villagers claimed, had eaten powder found where blasting was taking place at a quarry.
But protests over the boy's death began to involve a broad range of other issues, grievances over the project, and the failure of the government to provide promised funding. Four employees of joint venture contractors working on the site, Townsville-based Curtain Brothers and Perth-based Clough Engineering, suffered minor injuries during an attack.
As a result, acting police commissioner Tony Wagambie said extra police would be deployed to the area. The public affairs manager for Exxon subsidiary Esso Highlands, Miles Shaw, said this week that work at the Hides gas conditioning plant site would remain closed until ``a safe and secure operating environment'' could be restored.
Mr Shaw said the project was on course to deliver the first gas train in 2014. The next national election, traditionally the trigger for unrest in PNG, is due in mid-2012. The government sent Foreign Minister Don Polye and Education Minister James Marape, both Highlands MPs, to talk with the landowners, from whom they received a petition. They reported back to a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Michael Somare. Mr Polye said that ``there is no government presence'' at the LNG sites, which had to be corrected. Mr Somare announced that another Highlander, Deputy Prime Minister and Works Minister Sam Abal, would become the ``focal point for settling all outstanding issues relating to the PNG LNG project''.
He said the cabinet, which was also briefed by Exxon executives, also decided the government would make outstanding payments to landowners in two weeks. The opposition said: ``The forced shutdown of operations at Hides gas conditioning plant is not an isolated incident but a direct result of landowners' frustrations over the government's miserable failure to act in accordance with agreements it had entered into with them.''
The Post-Courier newspaper said the replacement of Mr Polye by Mr Abal as the key LNG project figure showed ``all is not well in the government; the divisions and distrusts are still there''.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"GAS: BHP Billiton is considering producing and selling coal-seam gas from its big Wards Well coking coal project in Queensland's Bowen Basin.
The miner has asked the federal Environment Department to start the approvals process on a 55-hole exploration drilling program to test whether a 7 million tonne a year hard coking coalmine at Wards Well, which is west of Mackay, is feasible.
 As part of the investigation, 12 holes will be drilled to test for CSG.
As well as the underground mine, BHP said it would look at building a gas-fired power station and at the potential to make money from the gas contained in the coal seams.
``Mine development and related issues such as potential gas extraction and potential commercialisation would be dealt with as a later, completely separate referral process,'' BHP said in a document filed with the department.
Coalmines need to extract gas in order to mine safely, so it is possible BHP is only considering producing small amounts, rather than returning to coal-seam gas production aims it had talked up in the early 2000s.
Since the CSG boom in Queensland spawned at least three big liquefied natural gas proposals, two of which have been approved, BHP has not shown any interest in the sector.
BHP yesterday was unable to confirm the extent of its gas commercialisation ambitions.
The company produces a small amount of coal-seam gas from its Illawarra coalmines to run its own power station and provide gas to local power stations.
BHP plans to get the approvals process on the mine and gas extraction started in the middle of this year, well before the results of the drilling come through next year.
BHP, which is the world's biggest coking coal producer, plans to bring its Queensland coking coal production, including joint venture partners' share, from around 60 million tonnes a year to 80 million tonnes.
It has not given a timeframe for its goals.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"ORIGIN SYDNEY, Jan 31 AAP - Origin Energy Ltd says it has achieved record first half sales revenue of $424 million.
The result was largely due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) production from Australia Pacific and higher contributions from the Kupe gas project in New Zealand and the Otway gas project in Victoria.
 Origin says production was 68.2 petajoules equivalent (PJe) in the six months to December 31, 2010 - a 38 per cent rise on the same period of 2009.
Sales revenues for the half year of $424 million were up 48 per cent compared with the prior corresponding period.
 Australia Pacific LNG increased production by 44 per cent for the 2010 half year,  Origin finance and strategy executive director Karen Moses said in a statement.
 Production capacity reached levels in excess of 320 terajoules per day (TJ/d) during the period.
 Notwithstanding severe weather conditions late in the December 2010 quarter, Australia Pacific LNG has continued to meet all of its domestic customer requirements. 
Production for the December quarter was 31.1 PJe, down 16 per cent on the September quarter result.
December quarter sales volumes and revenues were 14 per cent and 15 per cent lower, respectively, reflecting the reduced production.
 This result was in line with expectations and reflects seasonal demand, planned shutdowns at the Kupe and Otway gas projects and adverse weather conditions in Queensland and the Cooper Basin,  the company said.
At 1434 AEDT, shares in Origin Energy were down 18 cents at $16.38.
The company said exploration and evaluation expenditure was $121 million in the half year, associated with an expanded offshore and international drilling campaign.
The majority would be expensed in Origin's accounts for the six months to December 31, 2010, the company said.
 The expanded exploration program will continue into the second half of the 2011 financial year and drilling of the first of two appraisal wells on an existing discovery in Thailand commenced in the New Year,  Origin said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"PETSEC By Rebecca Le May
PERTH, Jan 31 AAP - Shale gas producers in the United States that are seeking to tap into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market could pose a competitive threat to Australian LNG players, an energy executive says.
 Petsec chief executive and chairman Terry Fern on Monday said US gas prices had sharply fallen due to oversupply caused by shale gas producers.
While shale gas is big in the US, it has its share of sceptics in Australia where the rush to bring LNG converted from coal seam gas (CSG) to Asian markets has been all-consuming for some companies.
Mr Fern said US shale gas producers were hoping to use their gas for LNG exports rather than domestic gas supply, which meant Australian LNG firms faced competition in coming years.
It could contribute to an LNG glut, mooted in some circles, by the middle of this decade when many major new LNG plants are slated to come on stream.
 An enormous amount of foreign money has been brought into the US for shale gas and most of the thinking is that it will go into LNG plants,  Mr Fern told AAP.
 What they're going to do now in the States is covert the LNG plants that were built to bring gas into America to take LNG out of America.
 So that's going to have some impact on what's happening here in Australia. 
He said LNG hopefuls developing plants needed to secure long-term sales contracts to attain their targeted sales prices rather than being  seduced into taking spot markets and leaving themselves open  to lower prices when there is too much supply.
 Six years ago, the industry was of the view that there was going to be gross undersupply of gas and gas prices would be potentially $US15 (per per thousand cubic feet or Mcfe) at this stage, which is pretty much the price that Australian LNG players think they can sell it into the Asian market. 
Instead, the average gas equivalent sales price in the US fell to $US5.74 per Mcfe in the December quarter, from $US7.29/Mcfe in the previous quarter, due to oversupply.
This prompted Petsec, a conventional oil and gas producer, to pull out of some of its Gulf of Mexico projects some 18 months earlier than planned.
 Because of the extraordinary success in shale gas, there's an oversupply and there will be a continuing oversupply for another couple of years,  Mr Fern said.
He said America's shale gas boom was being driven by technological advances, which would in time be adopted in other parts of the world - including markets such as China, which has large amounts of coal and shale.
 There will come a time when this technology will be available in large parts of the world.
 Once the technology is available to them, I think you'll see quite a reasonable amount of supply.
 In America, it works because they have such a big oil and gas industry, and all the infrastructure is there - pipelines, fraccing technology, drill rigs - that we don't have here.
 Once people take the view that they would much rather have domestic production as opposed to importing it, then I think we're going to see quite some change. 
Mr Fern said he believed shale gas had the most potential of all non-conventional energy sources, including CSG.

Rumours of a delay at Gorgon were exacerbated by drilling contractor AJ Lucas, which earlier this year issued a profit warning due in part to a  considerable delay  in the start of drilling work it was hired to carry out at the project.
Mr Watson acknowledged that labour was a significant issue in Â­Australia, but said Chevron had good relations with the unions.
He said Chevron was on track for a final investment decision on its Wheatstone LNG project, which is also in WA, later this year despite cost pressures.
 I don't expect that those cost pressures â€“ which are real â€“ will impact final investment decision since we have got . . . a pretty good idea of where they come from and how to mitigate them,  Mr Watson said.
He said the company's recent exploration success in WA â€“ it made five gas discoveries last year â€“ would be used to support future expansion opportunities at both Gorgon and Wheatstone.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"ENERGY giant Chevron has assured investors that it has enough customers already signed up for its Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied natural gas projects to be given final approval later this year.
In a conference call for the company's fourth-quarter earnings on Friday night, chairman and chief executive John Watson said the company was ``really pleased'' with the off-take agreements it had secured for both projects.
 ``We're at the 80 to 90 per cent level for both projects in terms of agreements that we have in place, and we certainly don't view sales agreements as an impediment to a final investment decision for Wheatstone,'' Mr Watson said. Chevron signed a multi-billion-dollar binding agreement last week to supply liquefied natural gas from Gorgon to Japan's Kyushu Electric, which has also signed a heads of agreement for LNG supply and equity sales from Wheatstone.
Mr Watson also dismissed suggestions the company should be concerned about rising cost pressures at Gorgon, saying they would not result in any delays at the $43 billion project.
``In terms of cost pressures, we're going through the engineering work now and we expect, based on what we're seeing, that we'll have a good handle on costs sufficient to make a final investment decision later in the year,'' he said.
``Gorgon is a $US37bn project but we have let contracts totalling about $US25bn so far, so we have a good idea what's in the marketplace, we're monitoring it well and I don't expect that those cost pressures, which are real, will impact on the final investment decision.
``We have got a pretty good idea of where they (cost pressures) come from and how to mitigate them.''
Mr Watson said Chevron had made five gas exploration discoveries in Australia during the December quarter, bringing to nine the number of new discoveries since Gorgon was sanctioned in 2009. ``These additional volumes will support expansion opportunities at both Gorgon and Wheatstone,'' he said.
Chevron reported fourth-quarter earnings of $US5.3bn, up 70 per cent from the same period a year earlier, as a result of higher prices and sales volumes.

The rain has also stopped exploration on the company's Surat Basin coal-seam gas ground in Queensland, where it and ConocoPhilips have been shoring up gas reserves for the $35 billion Australia-Pacific LNG project.
 According to Origin, drilling in December essentially ceased.
The APLNG joint venture drilled only 36 wells of 64 it had planned in the quarter.
Origin's second-quarter production was 31.1 petajoules of gas, down from 37.1PJ in the September quarter, and revenue slipped to $194.6m, from $229.7m.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee had been expecting production and revenue close to the September quarter numbers.
As a result, his full-year net profit estimate slipped 4 per cent to $675.1m, and his target price for Origin shares dropped from $16.80 to $16.60. Yesterday, Origin shares slipped 13c to $16.43.
And wet weather in the Cooper Basin, lower seasonal demand and repairs at the Otway Gas project in Bass Strait hit production. At Otway, Origin has had to replace two gas compressors.

Israel's military planning relies on peace with Egypt; nearly half the natural gas it uses is imported from Egypt; and the principle of trading conquered land for diplomatic ties began with its 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt more than any other foreign leader, except President Barack Obama. If Mubarak were driven from power, the effect on Israel could be profound. For the United States, Egypt was the keystone of its Middle-East policy, a senior official said. For Israel, it was the whole arch. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because Netanyahu
 has ordered his ministers and their officials to stay publicly silent on Egypt while events there play out. Many analysts in Israel said that even if Mubarak were forced to leave office, those who replaced him could maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, since it is the basis for more than $1billion in annual aid to Cairo from the United States and much foreign investment. But others noted that the best- organised political force in Egypt is the Muslim Brotherhood, which is hostile to Israel and close to Hamas, the Palestinian rulers in Gaza whose
weapons-smuggling the Egyptian Government continually works to block. As the Government evacuated the families of envoys from Egypt at the weekend, public affairs broadcasts and newspapers in Israel focused on the unfolding events there.

 The Hunter Valley Protection Alliance has circulated excerpts of an email it says Mr Souris sent to the representatives last week after its lobbyists offered him a briefing on their exploration in his Upper Hunter electorate.
 As far as I am concerned we do not want gas exploration or gas development in these high-profile, high-value tourism areas (Broke Fordwich and Pokolbin) and I am an opponent of AGL's activities, a matter which I am committed to my constituents to pursue to finality when there is a change of government,  Mr Souris is quoted as writing.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2011,1,"MINING
THE Planning Minister, Tony Kelly, has given the strongest sign yet that the state government would ban the use of a group of chemicals in the controversial technique known as fracking to extract coal seam gas.
 Mr Kelly yesterday published a scoping paper on the coal and gas industry to provide an overview of the main problems facing the coalmining regions of the Hunter, Gunnedah and the western and southern coalfields.
The chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - collectively referred to as BTEX - are sometimes used in the fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, process for extracting coal seam gas.
Mr Kelly said the government was  inclined  to ban the mining practice of BTEX fracking, which the Queensland government banned last year, but he wanted community input before taking the matter to cabinet.
 We are probably of a mind to do the same [as Queensland],  Mr Kelly said.
The terms of reference for the paper, which was first promised as a strategic plan for the coal industry before Christmas, were expanded to include gas in order to consider fracking, Mr Kelly said.
The paper will be on public exhibition until April 15, more than two weeks after the state election. A stakeholder reference group will be set up and public meetings held.
Mr Kelly said the decision to develop a coal and gas strategy came from a surge in demand for Australian minerals and the past impact of mining on other primary industries such as farming and horse breeding.
 They should be able to coexist,  Mr Kelly said.
The NSW Minerals Council chief executive, Nikki Williams, said the paper was  welcome if long overdue .
 We need a land use planning road map so we can all move forward together,  Dr Williams said.  Ultimately it's up to our political leaders to get the balance right. 
The vice president of the NSW Farmers Association, Fiona Simson, said the scoping paper was  too little, too late  and was designed to assist the coal industry, not other industries.
The Greens MP Cate Faehrmann welcomed the strategy but questioned why it could not be matched with a moratorium on the coal seam gas industry, which she said had been  proven to be dangerous for water supplies and productive farmlands .

The recent cold snap throughout the US had many traders expecting an even bigger decline in supplies. When that didn't happen, they decided it was time to sell, according to analyst and trader Stephen Schork.
 Gas prices have dropped well below the levels they were at from 2007 and 2008, and  everyone's trying to time the bottom of the market,  Schork said.  They keep waiting for natural gas to rally, but it's been three years and nothing's happened. 
Natural gas for March delivery fell 9.2 cents to settle at $4.337 per 1,000 cubic feet on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices have risen slightly since October, when gas traded for less than $3.30 per 1,000 cubic feet. But they're nowhere near levels in 2007 and 2008.
Gas prices were close to $14 per 1,000 cubic feet in July, 2008. In the past six months they have stayed between $3.20 and $4.75.
The drop helped homeowners and businesses pay for heat and energy during the recession, but natural gas is starting to rise again, according to a government survey of utilities and municipal gas providers.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"ELECTRICITY prices on the east coast will rise further as the coal-seam gas industry begins exporting and consumers are forced to pay international prices for it.
The government's climate change adviser Ross Garnaut said the east coast had received a ``free kick'' because its gas market was not open to exports.
 But the coal-seam gas industry had opened the market up to exports and that would force international prices into the market. The west coast had paid higher prices for gas because it had been open to exports.
A carbon price would contribute only a small proportion to electricity price rises. ``There are lots of other things driving up electricity prices,'' he said, citing substantial increases in coal prices and investments in transmission lines.
And the extent of any price rises caused by a carbon regime would depend on the success of the transition to non-carbon intensive technologies.
It would also be open to the government -- which would receive the revenue from permits in an emission trading scheme -- to compensate consumers without reducing incentives to economise on electricity.
Professor Garnaut said his 2008 climate change review for the Rudd government had foreshadowed large electricity price rises based on increasing coal prices.
A forthcoming paper on the electricity industry as part of his climate change review update would focus on how much the price rises were attributable to increased energy prices and how much was down to policy issues, he said.
Professor Garnaut's comments came as opposition finance spokesman Andrew Robb launched a strong defence of the coal industry, which he said faced a carbon tax as well as the mining tax. ``At all times the best outcome is achieved if you back your strengths, whether you are talking about the strengths of an individual, a business or organisation or a country,'' he said.
``To punish our great strengths, our wealth-creating sectors such as the miners, rather than encouraging them to do the heavy lifting in growing the economic pie, is a perverse and misguided way to address the two-speed economy.''

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"ROYAL Dutch Shell is aiming to approve its revolutionary $10 billion floating liquefied natural gas project off Western Australia in coming months, but a final investment decision appears to have slipped by at least a few months.
Shell's previous stated aim was to make a decision on Prelude ``in early 2011''.
 But it is understood the Anglo-Dutch giant now believes that date was optimistic and the company is targeting June 30 as a deadline for approval.
A Shell spokeswoman said last night there had been no delay to its FID plan. The company is planning to develop Prelude as quickly as possible to have it in production by 2016, allowing it to boast of producing gas less than 10 years after the gasfield was discovered.
Shell has refused to give a cost estimate for the Prelude project, but analysts at Wood Mackenzie have estimated it will cost $US11bn ($10.85bn) to develop. It is believed only about $US2bn of that capital spending over the life of the project would be in Australia. The project will employ 350 people, including 200 offshore.
The Prelude project is also in a race to be the world's first floating LNG development, a radical technology aimed at opening up other stranded gas deposits that would otherwise remain undeveloped.
The gas will be processed on a 600,000 tonne offshore vessel instead of being piped to an onshore facility. It will be moored about 475km north-northeast of Broome and more than 200km from the nearest point on the mainland. If approved, the facility would be built by South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries and is being touted as potentially the largest floating structure ever built.
Prelude will be capable of producing 3.6 million tonnes of LNG, 1.3 million tonnes of condensate and 400,000 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas. The revised estimate on FID for Prelude came as Shell last night reported that its global fourth-quarter profit had tripled, but this missed analysts' expectations.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"Group fears contamination of water supply
ROUS WATER acting general manager Wayne Franklin says he can understand why people are scared about the activities of the coal seam gas industry.
 He said it was caused by a lack of proper information about the potential effects of coal seam exploration and production.
â€œThere is a lack of information to make a proper assessment, and a lot of misinformation,â€? he said.
Mr Franklin said he supported the NSW Government's plan to toughen regulations and controls on exploration drilling for coal seam gas, which was announced last year.
However, any changes to exploration licences by the NSW Government should be retrospective so as to include operations already licensed, Mr Franklin said.
Mr Franklin's comments came after The Northern Star asked Rous Water to respond to concerns raised by the Keerrong Anti Gas Squad, a group concerned about the coal seam gas industry, and about the potential risk the industry posed to the region's water supply.
The Shell and PetroChina-ownedArrow Energy is currently conducting exploratory drilling at several locations throughout the Northern Rivers,including Bexhill.
The group is concerned that if the Bexhill site goes into full gas production there is the possibility waterways leading into the Wilsons River may be contaminated.
Water from the Wilsons is pumped into Rocky Creek Dam, which supplies drinking water to Lismore, Ballina, Byron Bay, Ocean Shores, Brunswick Heads, Evans Head, Coraki, Broadwater, Alstonville, Lennox Head, Bangalow and Woodburn.
Anti Gas Squad member Ian Gaillard said he had many concerns about the industry, but the most serious related to the effects drilling may have on aquifers, the dangers of fraccing, and evaporation ponds spilling into waterways.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"THE miserable and diplomatically fraught confrontation between Woodside Petroleum and East Timor over a proposed $14 billion liquid natural gas project called Sunrise has reached a bizarre new low, with one of the world's poorest nations suspending negotiations on the company's proposed development plans.
Greater Sunrise is a pair of good-sized gas and condensate fields discovered way back in 1974 and a combination of buoyant energy pricing and new production technologies means their time for successful commercialisation should be dawning.
 Global petroleum certainly thinks so.
The Sunrise partners, led by operator Woodside (which owns 33.4 per cent of the project), along with ConocoPhillips (30 per cent), Shell (26.6 per cent) and Osaka Gas (10 per cent), are ready to spend the billions necessary to extract and process the gas wealth, and have targeted late 2016 for production.
But Sunrise has become mired in a sink of misplaced aspirations and misunderstanding born of good intentions and an understandable national guilt.
The Sunrise and Troubadour discoveries sit at the northern edge of Australia's continental shelf, some 450km northwest of Darwin but about 150km southeast of the fledgling nation of East Timor.
The result is that, while all the permitting that delivers Woodside et al ownership of the gas they found in 1974 is Australian, some 30 years of exhaustive and thoroughly necessary negotiation that started with Indonesia and was continued by East Timor has resulted in the commonwealth agreeing to divide ownership of the fields with its new and junior neighbour.
Two iterations of international agreements (the second fuelled to considerable degree by a public campaign by Australians concerned we were somehow ripping off the tiny East Timor by claiming resources that sit on our continental shelf) have apportioned 18 per cent of the Greater Sunrise gas to East Timor but a substantially greater share of any ``upstream'' revenues generated by the development.
The effect of the overlapping arrangements is that, according to Woodside's most recent estimates, East Timor's national coffers would be enriched by $US13bn ($12.9bn) over the life of the Sunrise project while it would generate $US19bn for the commonwealth.
Now, however you cut it, that disproportionate share of the revenue pie reflects well on Australia's determination to actively assist East Timor in its quest for financial sustainability.
But cash-strapped East Timor wants a whole lot more from the Sunrise joint venture than simply revenue. It views the project as the potential cornerstone of a new generation of industry and so is insisting that the joint venture lands and processes the gas in East Timor.
That is a nice idea and if Woodside's mission statement listed the fostering of nascent democracies as its fundamental requirement, then it would make sense. But, for good or ill, that is not how things are.
Continued on Page 40
Continued from Page 25
Woodside does not want to pipe the gas anywhere -- not to the other onshore option, Darwin, and certainly not down and then up the 2950 metre cliff faces of the Timor Trench.
Woodside's board is required to act in the interests of its shareholders. It would cost Woodside $US5bn more to build an LNG plant in East Timor than to exercise commercial good sense and build a floating processing plant above the fields.
And, even though the 278km of 26-inch pipeline needed would sit at the very edge of the technological challenges known to the gas industry, the link represents a relatively small portion of that increased cost.
The greater part of the additional cost is the construction of a greenfields LNG plant on the south coast of East Timor, a challenge that carries with it a steep increase in project and sovereign risk.
These points and many more are made in the three separate concept studies the JV delivered to the Sixth Sunrise Commission on September 29 last year.
In response, on December 16, East Timor requested that the two regulators of the Greater Sunrise agreements stop evaluation of Woodside's concept studies. The government claimed then (and is still claiming) that Woodside has, in part, studied the wrong thing.
The idea, apparently, is that Woodside is entitled to assess only the production of the gas, and not its processing.
Essentially, the Gusmao government seems to be claiming Woodside owns the gas only until it hits the surface.
After that, its fate lies in the hands of the Australian and East Timor governments.
In a statement confirming suspension on Sunrise, released on January 24, the East Timor government asked the twin regulators of the gasfields to ``cease their evaluation of Woodside's development concepts''. According to government spokesman Agio Pereira, this was because Woodside has ``included not only upstream but also downstream activities'' in its proposals.
``Woodside has no licence or permit to carry out downstream activities nor have the States given the right to the National Petroleum Authority to assess downstream activities which are not covered in the Timor Sea Treaty.
``Therefore, neither Woodside nor regulators will proceed with the proposals until the downstream title issue is resolved.''
Clearly, East Timor is saying the ``States'' have the power under the treaties to dictate how Greater Sunrise is developed.
It may indicate, too, a belief that the government can award processing rights to a party other than the joint venture.
Woodside rejects both these propositions as inconsistent with the requirements of the international treaty and Australian law.
Woodside's view is that Pereira's attempt to draw legal distinction between the ``upstream'' and ``downstream'' components of an LNG development reflects the different tax regimes that apply to different parts of an LNG project.
In Australia, a Petroleum Resource Rent Tax applies to ``upstream'' (prior to entry into the liquefaction train) and income tax applies to the ``downstream'' (the value adding resulting from liquefaction).
But that holds no relevance in the context apparently being used by East Timor.
The more fundamental question is who has the legal right
to extract and market the gas molecules.
The International Unitisation Agreement between Australia and East Timor sets out a framework for the development of Greater Sunrise that includes a requirement that ``the exploitation of the Unit Reservoirs shall be undertaken in an integrated manner in accordance with the terms of this agreement''.
It is the terms of the IUA that apportions 79.9 per cent of the Greater Sunrise gas to Australia and specifies that that portion is exclusively regulated by Australian law.
That, in turn, would suggest that, even under a worst-case scenario for Woodside, the East Timor government would have no call over that greater slice of the production.
Now, from the JV's perspective, the other key part of the IUA is contained in article 12. It effectively prescribes the process for approval of the Greater Sunrise development plan.
Article 12 says the regulator ``shall'' sign off on a project where:
l The project is commercially viable;
l The contractor or licensee possesses the competence and resources needed to exploit the reservoir to the best commercial advantage;
l The contractor or licensee is seeking to exploit the reservoir to the best commercial advantage consistent with good oilfield practice;
lThe contractor of licensee could reasonably be expected to carry out the exploitation of the reservoir during the specified period;
lThe contractor or licensee has entered into contracts for the sale of gas from the project which are consistent with arms length transactions.
Nonetheless, nothing can happen without East Timor's sign-off and that does not look likely anytime soon.
So what happens now?
There are arbitration mechanisms to break treaty deadlocks, but a successful arbitration requires the active participation of both governments and, what's more, undertakings by both to recognise and act on the recommendations that emerge from that process.
Which all leaves Sunrise exactly where?
In the wake of spokesman Pereira's feisty rant, key powers in Timorese politics (including President Ramos Horta and Fretlin leader Mari Alkatiri) have called for a return to discussion on Woodside's proposals.
Mind you, each reinforced that TLNG, not FLNG (as in Timor, not Floating), remains the right national ambition.
Which pretty much means that the gas at Greater Sunrise will remain right where it is for sometime yet given that there is no way any sane board can sign off on a project that will cost $US5bn more than it should.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The Minister for Mining says there is very little  fracking  for coal seam gas in NSW at the moment and no-one is using the chemical, banned in Queensland, called B-TEX.
The Environmental Defenders Office has raised a number of concerns about the hydraulic fracturing technique used to extract the gas.
 In particular, it's concerned about the cumulative effect of so many exploration and production holes.
Minister Steve Whan says he's not clear just how many holes are being drilled in NSW.
 It's not possible to say how many holes. In any single exploration, there would be a lot of holes drilled, but we have strategies in place for how they are capped and kept secure. 
He says the sector is very small at this time.
 There are only a few producing wells on the north coast, at Camden in the Sydney Basin and in the Pillega in the State's north-west. 
Mr Whan says very few of those are using fracking to explore for gas.
 Since 2000, only 20 frackings have occurred. 
AGL used the technique prior to 2004, as did Eastern Star, and most recently a hole was drilled on the north coast in November 2010, but the company there used a sealed, encased system.
Hydraulic fracturing is designed to get the coal seam gas open and to get the gas out.
 The majority of coal seam gas exploration doesn't involve fracking which has a bad reputation, but undeservedly,  Mr Whan said.
 Coal seam gas is no different to any other type of mineral production.
 It will be treated on a case by case (basis), and we will carefully detail what will be affected, how it will be treated. 
The minister is very supportive of the coal gas industry.
 We are piping gas from SA and our oil is imported, both at a high environmental cost. We must go ahead with caution, to meet the need for new energy and to protect water table and the environment.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"INTERNATIONAL ratings agency Fitch expects the credit ratings of Australia's ``up-stream'' exploration and production gas companies - including Queensland's putative liquefied natural gas producers - to deteriorate this year.
But Fitch's worries about the financial health of the sector is not a view on the market, particularly. Rather, Fitch said yesterday it expected exploration and production companies' ``credit quality'' to deteriorate in 2011 due to higher debt-funded capital expenditure.
 Fitch said: ``The significant project pipeline (that Queensland and Western Australia LNG hopefuls have ahead of them) implies an increasing dependence on external borrowings to fund capex and dividend commitments.''
Fitch said it expected ``higher borrowings and negative (free cash flows) as Australian upstream companies committed to new projects''.
With companies like Santos and Origin Energy just setting out on their plans to follow the UK's BG Group in building LNG projects on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour - estimated to cost up to $20 billion - the fact that cash outflow will likely exceed their overall cash flow in the short term is not surprising.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Expansion of Australia's liquefied natural gas industry will negate any attempt to reduce carbon emissions by a carbon tax. The target is to reduce emissions below Australia's levels in the year 2000 by as much as 25 per cent, but today emissions are about 80 million tonnes of carbon dioxide more than they were in 2000. So the target emissions reduction could be in the order of 100 million tonnes.
These reductions are to be achieved using a combination of a carbon tax and other measures including the renewable energy targets (RET).
 However, with the development of Australia's LNG industry in both Western Australia and Queensland, carbon emissions are set to rise dramatically from today's levels. In the production of LNG from natural gas or coal-seam gas, any carbon dioxide in the raw gas is removed, and emitted to the atmosphere.
Newer projects could bury these emissions underground, as is the case with the Gorgon project in WA.
An extensive refrigeration plant driven by electricity is required to produce LNG. This is generally produced on-site by burning gas in a gas turbine. For coal-seam gas, additional electricity is needed to compress the gas for transmission to the LNG liquefaction plants. For every million tonnes of LNG produced, about half a million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be emitted from the electricity generation required.
The proposed LNG developments, which will potentially produce more than 60 million tonnes of LNG by 2016, will produce an additional 30 million tonnes of carbon emission. If all of the developments come to fruition, the total additional carbon emissions could exceed 60 million tonnes by 2020.
It is argued that LNG is a relatively clean fuel, displacing more polluting coal from the world's energy fuels. However, as the burgeoning demand for Australian coal shows, this cannot be wholly true. Indeed most of the new LNG developments are slated to supply the growing cities of India and China, which need fresh energy sources to supply the heat and power for major new cities. These cities are generally being populated from the country, where renewable fuels dominate. So, if anything, LNG is displacing renewable fuels.
If a carbon tax is to be applied, the LNG industry should pay its fair share. It cannot be equitable to apply a carbon tax to domestic power generators and domestic consumers but somehow exempt power generated for LNG that will benefit foreign consumers for no measurable emission benefit.
Export LNG is unlikely to be able to pay much in the way of carbon tax (or be subject to RET), unless as an export industry, along with all other export industries, it would have the cost remitted. This will result in negligible reduction in carbon emissions, which is the stated objective of the carbon tax.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Beijing may be tempted to use force to take over disputed islands claimed by smaller neighbours, writes Michael Richardson.
Are future military clashes unthinkable between China and its South-East Asian neighbours over their conflicting claims to islands, fisheries and seabed resources â€“ including oil, natural gas and minerals â€“ in the South China Sea?
 After all, there is now extensive two-way trade and rapidly growing investment that gives both sides a strong common interest in ensuring that nothing is done to upset the peace that makes economic progress possible. Interdependence has been enhanced by the results of the Association of South-East Asian Nations-China Free Trade Area in its first full year of operation.
Trade amounted to almost $US293 billion in 2010, hitting a record high. China has become ASEAN's biggest trading partner, while ASEAN is China's fourth-largest source of trade.
Yet there is a nagging worry that when it comes to the South China Sea dispute, ASEAN and China are talking past each other instead of firming up arrangements to rule out force and then trying to resolve the overlapping territorial claims.
Australia has a strong stake in this outcome. Much of Australia's trade with East Asia, by far the country's biggest regional source of commerce, is by sea.
Part of it goes through the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest maritime arteries. Australia is also a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, along with Britain, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysia is one of the South-East Asian countries that have conflicting territorial claims with China. Although Australia would not be automatically obliged to defend Malaysia in case of external attack, it would be obliged to consult with other FPDA partners in a crisis.
Even though China signed a voluntary code of peaceful conduct in the South China Sea with ASEAN in 2002, it has so far refused to make it legally binding and continues to insist that territorial dispute negotiations should not involve ASEAN.
Instead, they must be bilateral, between China and individual South-East Asian claimant states. Since China is by far the strongest party, economically and militarily, in the dispute, its approach appears designed to enable Beijing to prevail against weaker neighbours and create divisions in ASEAN.
Indonesia, which chairs ASEAN this year, is trying to break the deadlock, but without much sign of success so far. Expressing frustration at an ASEAN ministerial meeting last month, Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Marty Natalegawa, warned that if conflicts in the maritime heart of South-East Asia were not properly managed, they could  spiral out of control  and undermine regional stability.
Senior Chinese officials, both civilian and military, have said repeatedly that China has  indisputable sovereignty  over certain islands, including the Paracels and Spratlys in the South China Sea and surrounding waters.
As the Vietnam War drew to an end, Chinese forces took complete control of the Paracels in 1974, infuriating nominal ally Hanoi. Since none of the claimants in the South China Sea can demonstrate long and continuous past occupation and administration of any of the disputed specks of land there, possession is nine-tenths of the law in this maritime Wild West.
Here, Beijing finds itself in a relatively weak position compared with other claimants in the widely scattered Spratly Islands in the central sector of the South China Sea. It does not occupy any of the best bits of real estate.
According to a Vietnamese analysis, only a dozen of the many atolls in the Spratly chain are possibly large enough to generate wider maritime claims of the kind China seems to be making. The Philippines holds six of them, Vietnam five and Taiwan one.
China faces the same situation in its dispute with Japan over ownership of the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Japan, not China, is in control of the disputed territory. In both areas, China's assertive behaviour has raised concerns that as it gets even stronger it will be tempted to use force to grab what it cannot get by negotiation.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Royal Dutch Shell may offer Gazprom assets in Asia in exchange for a deal to expand Russia's only Â­liquefied gas export plant, as part of talks on a wider global alliance.
Shell wants to add a third liquefied natural gas production unit at the $US22 billion Sakhalin-2 venture north of Japan, raising output 50 per cent. The Hague-based company is selecting overseas assets to win Â­support from Gazprom. Shell may gain access to new offshore blocks to supply the plant.
 The talks follow an agreement in November to expand co-operation between Europe's largest oil company and Russia's gas export monopoly. Shell chief executive officer Peter Voser and Gazprom's Alexei Miller have set deadlines for the talks.
Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP are teaming up with state-run companies to gain access to resources in Russia, the world's biggest producer of oil and gas. For their part, Russian producers are looking to expand overseas and maintain output at home using foreign expertise.
Last month, BP agreed with Rosneft to swap shares, explore three blocks in Russia's Arctic waters and possibly work abroad.
The two companies are also exchanging data on oilfields in west Siberia, where they run the Salym Petroleum venture. The November accord covered possible oil and gas projects in west Siberia, Russia's far east and abroad, as well as European refining and retail.
Shell, which agreed to cede control of Sakhalin-2 to Gazprom in 2006 under government pressure, is pushing to expand the plant and win markets in China and India. Gazprom has held back on agreeing to expand Sakhalin-2 while it examines a rival plant near Vladivostok.
Gazprom will target areas of Â­strategic interest, which may include the Asia-Pacific region and LNG projects.
The list of possible assets in exchange for Sakhalin expansions has not been finalised.
Shell is spending about $US50 billion in Australia over the next decade to develop gas export projects. The company is also drilling for unconventional gas in China.
 As Gazprom wants to be a major player in the LNG markets, then I think Australian equity participation would be most obvious  as a candidate for the Russian company, said Oswald Clint, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin invited the explorer to participate in the nearby Sakhalin-3 and Sakhalin-4 oil and gas projects during a June 2009 meeting with Mr Voser and then-CEO Jeroen van der Veer.
The Sakhalin-2 plant started production in 2009, reaching full capacity last year and accounting for 5 per cent of global production of the fuel, according to Shell. Gas may account for more than half of Shell's total production by 2012.
Vera Surzhenko, a spokeswoman at Shell in Moscow, said the companies were  considering opportunities  and declined to name any assets outside Russia that they might consider. Within Russia, Shell and Gazprom were looking at new projects on the basis of existing assets, she said. Sergei Kupriyanov, a Gazprom spokesman, and Denis Rebrov, a Gazprom Neft spokesman, declined to comment.
Gazprom owns 50 per cent of Sakhalin Energy, the Sakhalin-2 operator. Shell holds 27.5 per cent and Mitsubishi and Mitsui also have stakes.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Asset sales and field downgrades kept oil and gas reserves at Santos roughly flat for the year but a healthy up-tick in coal seam gas resources has lifted confidence in the market that the company is well covered for its flagship liquefied natural gas project in Gladstone.
Yesterday Santos reported only a minimal increase in proven and probable (2P) reserves at the end of 2010 from a year ago, after taking into account both production over the year and the $650 million sell-down of a 15 per cent stake in its GLNG venture to France's Total.
 Reserves on the benchmark 2P basis climbed to 1.445 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2010, up from 1.44 billion boe a year earlier.
Although Santos added 165 million boe of reserves in the year, it produced 50 million boe and sold 110 million boe, so the net gain was minimal.
Including Santos's further sale of a stake in GLNG to Korea Gas, a deal that was only completed last month, reserves dropped about 7 per cent.
But as signalled in December, coal seam gas reserves at the GLNG venture jumped 25 per cent to just over 5000 petajoules on the back of intensive drilling through the year in the run-up to the final investmentÂ decision last month on the $US16 billion project.
Resources in the looser 3P and 2C categories surged by about 30 per cent and now total 11,412 petajoules.
Independent certifiers estimate that over 85 per cent of that volume could ultimately be converted into 2P reserves, providing enough gas to run the GLNG plant for 20 years, Macquarie Group analyst Adrian Wood said yesterday.
The additional deal struck last October for Santos to supply another 750 petajoules of gas from the Cooper Basin to Gladstone was  more about insurance,  Mr Wood said.
The resource numbers indicate that some of the smaller coal seam gas explorers targeting sales to the GLNG project will not get a look-in.
In any case, should the GLNG venture or any of the other LNG ventures in Gladstone find themselves short of supplies, they were much more likely to borrow or swap reserves with each other rather than buy gas, said Gundi Royle, energy analyst at Moelis.
 The CSG-LNG projects are already very skinny, with rates of return of around 11 per cent because they don't have any condensates, that's their major flaw  Ms Royle said.
 So to go out and buy molecules which are fairly expensive when they could just trade them in the market doesn't make sense. 
Elsewhere in Santos's portfolio, reserve additions arising from the development approvals for the Spar project off WA and the Wortel project in Indonesia were partly offset by a downgrade in reserves at the Henry and Netherby fields off Victoria, as flagged by partner AWE last month.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"BRITISH gas giant BG Group has started marketing gas from a $5 billion third production train (plant) at its Queensland Curtis LNG project at Gladstone, and predicts the site could eventually contain five liquefied natural gas trains.
BG chief executive Frank Chapman said the company had made good progress in expanding its onshore Queensland coal seam gas reserves and resources and was looking at expansion of the $18bn, two-train LNG export project approved by BG in November.
 Since taking over Queensland Gas in 2008, Mr Chapman told investors, BG had quadrupled its gross gas resources to 21 trillion cubic feet and increased proven and probable reserves sixfold to 8 trillion cubic feet.
``A rapidly evolving and maturing resources picture, which together with third-party gas opportunities, supports our efforts towards sanction of a third train,'' Mr Chapman said.
Curtis's first two trains are designed to produce 8.5 million tonnes of LNG a year, which is short of the 12 million tonnes for which environmental approval has been granted. ``The Curtis Island site is permitted for three trains and has space for up to five trains, giving a potential of some 20 million tonnes per annum,'' Mr Chapman said. This is the first time BG has said its site could hold five trains, a claim made last year by Santos for its site at Curtis Island.
The aggressive talk-up of expansions could signal BG's willingness to do deals with Gladstone rivals Shell-PetroChina and Origin-ConocoPhillips, which are yet to get environmental or board approval for their Gladstone LNG ambitions.
Mr Chapman said he estimated a third train would be 40 per cent cheaper than the development cost of each of the first two trains. Based on the total cost of the first stage being $18bn -- including cash spent before formal approval -- this would represent a $5.4bn cost for a third train.
``It will be very economic indeed, irrespective of whether one sources that 100 per cent from equity gas or whether there is a mix of some third-party gas,'' he said. ``We've already begun marketing train three and are confident we can secure further sales.''
BG was the first of the big four Gladstone LNG proponents to approve its project, followed by Santos, which last month approved construction of a two-train project on Curtis Island.
Mr Chapman said he wanted to approve the third train by May next year so it would be possible to easily switch construction crews working on the first two trains to the third. The 21 trillion cubic feet of estimated gas resources was enough for three trains but would take time to convert to proven and probable reserves, he said.
Separately, Origin's joint venture partner ConocoPhillips said approval of the Australia-Pacific LNG project could be a few months away.
Conoco oil and gas production head Ryan Lance told investors he expected federal environmental approvals this month, but gave no indication a project sanction -- planned for last year and dependent on offtake deals being signed -- would follow immediately. ``Our expectation is that over the next few months, you'll see us making a number of announcements with respect to APLNG and moving that project forward,'' he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"UK gas giant BG has thrown down the gauntlet to liquefied natural gas rivals in Queensland by setting an aggressive April 2012 target for a go-ahead on the expansion of its project under construction in Gladstone.
Adding a third processing line at the Queensland Curtis LNG project could cost 40 per cent less on a unit cost basis than the first two-train phase and looked  hugely economic , BG chief executive Frank Chapman told investors in London.
 BG's timetable for the expansion ups the pressure on other companies planning coal seam gas-based LNG projects in Gladstone, particularly the Australia Pacific LNG venture between Origin Energy and ConocoÂ­Phillips, which missed its end-2010 target for a final investment decision and has yet to lock in customers.
Construction work is gradually ramping up on the first $US16 billion phase of QCLNG after BG sanctioned the investment in late October. Deliveries are due to start in 2014 to China, Japan, Singapore and Chile.
Mr Chapman was particularly bullish about the outlook for LNG demand and confident about the adequacy of gas reserves for an expansion and the prospect of inking more LNG sales contracts.
He said coal seam gas resources for QCLNG had quadrupled to 21 trillion cubic feet, already enough  more or less  for three trains, since BG first acquired an interest in Queensland Gas Co three years ago.
 Ideally we'd like to sanction that within 18 months of the first two trains in order to get construction continuing,  he said.
 So the game is on in terms of conducting exploration and appraisal drilling in order to try to prove up reserves in that time-frame. 
There was also the potential to use third-party gas.
BG already has almost 10 million tonnes per year of sales contracts from QCLNG, more than the initial capacity of 8.5 million tonnes.
Analysts said yesterday that China's CNOOC, its biggest customer for the first phase, would be an obvious candidate to buy LNG from the expansion. The Curtis Island site has permits for 12 million tonnes per year of output so no more government approvals are needed for the third train.
BG dismissed concerns about a global oversupply of LNG that could weigh on prices.
Global demand in 2020 would probably be much higher than the consensus forecast of 350 million tonnes, led by China, while approved supply capacity was lagging behind, it said.
Martin Houston, executive vice-president, Americas & Global LNG, said:  We sometimes hear that the world is awash with gas and LNG, now and into the future. We just do not agree with those views. Instead we expect strong growth in global gas demand through the decade with supply struggling to keep pace. 
BG is relying on its Australian project to lift its LNG supplies by 50 per cent, to 20 million tonnes per year, by 2015 and is now targeting another gain to 30 million tonnes by 2020, underpinned by the expansion.
The rush of LNG plant construction at Gladstone, where Santos and Shell are also developing projects, combined with surging LNG and iron ore investment in Western Australia, is expected to exacerbate shortages of labour and engineering resources. Rebuilding after the Queensland floods is adding to the pressures.
BG chief financial officer Ashley Almanza acknowledged the inflationary pressures but said BG, by getting ahead of its rivals and locking in work contracts and labour agreements, had put itself  in the best possible position to deal with that risk .
KEY POINTS BG's Curtis Island site has permits for 12 million tonnes a year of annual output. Adding a third train wouldn't require additional government approvals.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"Major coal seam gas (CSG) companies in southern Queensland's Surat Basin say production is ramping up after the recent floods.
Southern Queensland's floods cut off many of the region's gas wells but a month later operations have now picked up.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2011,1,"ABOUT $9 billion worth of government subsidies are flowing to the mining, gas and petroleum industries each year, directly contradicting government efforts to cut greenhouse emissions, a new report says.
The Australia Institute analysed tax breaks for fossil fuel use in recent budgets, including excise exemptions for the liquefied natural gas industry and fuel credits for aircraft and company cars. Its report says there is little point in putting a price on carbon emissions without first cutting incentives for using them.
  Proposing to introduce a carbon price while retaining existing fossil fuel subsidies is analogous to driving a car with the accelerator and the brake both pressed to the floor,  said the report's authors, Richard Denniss and Andrew McIntosh, an economist at the Australian National University.
The Greens, who will hold the balance of power in the Senate when the government's carbon trading legislation is debated, have endorsed the findings and suggested some of the rebates and subsidies could be wound back as part of a climate change deal.
 At the moment energy policy and climate change policy are on a collision course, and as a result the government is massively subsidising these activities that are cutting across their climate change efforts,  said the Greens senator Christine Milne.
Federal government data released this week shows that greenhouse emissions from the mining and gas-extraction industries are expected to rise more steeply than other sections of the economy in the next decade.
Australia's fugitive emissions - those which escape into the atmosphere as a resource is being taken from the ground and processed - will go up 69 million tonnes a year by 2020, 97 per cent more than in 2000, the data says. This reflects the ballooning number of new mining and gas projects approved in the past three years. Electricity production still accounts for the biggest share of Australia's net greenhouse output of about 582 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Coal-fired and gas-driven power plants are responsible for 51 per cent of the nation's total emissions.
NSW saw a slight dip in its emissions from the energy sector in 2010, reflecting the fact that more of its power was sourced from interstate, and a generally mild winter meant fewer people relied on electricity to heat their homes.
The NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change said a shift towards gas power also played a part, with gas plants at Tallawarra, Uranquinty and Colongra producing more power.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"One of Santos's three partners in its $US16 billion liquefied natural gas project in Queensland is considering selling most of its stake only weeks after joining â€“ sparking some conjecture about the venture's economic viability.
Newswire reports from Seoul yesterday revealed that Korea Gas Corp, the world's biggest LNG buyer, is considering on-selling two-thirds of its 15 per cent stake in the GLNG project to Korean or Japanese partners.
 The news took the market by surprise as Santos had not flagged that possibility when it concluded a long-awaited $665 million deal in December to bring Kogas into the venture.
The Korean utility also committed then to purchase a hefty 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG over 20 years, almost half the project's output, in a deal worth about $US60 billion.
There is no indication yet whether Kogas will also on-sell part of those volumes, in addition to the equity stake.
The GLNG project, which had the final go-ahead last month to start construction, comprises Santos (30 per cent), Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total (27.5 per cent each) and Kogas.
The profitability of coal seam gas-based LNG projects, which include no gas condensates production to boost revenue streams, is yet to be commercially proven. Some analysts suggest rates of return on projects such as GLNG may be as low as 11 per cent.
Adding to doubts about the economics of  dry  gas projects is this week's news that ConocoÂ­Phillips will close its Kenai LNG project in Alaska because of a deteriorating LNG market. That plant, which also uses gas that has no liquids, has been cited by some CSG-LNG project proponents as evidence that such ventures are profitable.
Santos indicated yesterday that a selldown by Kogas had always been envisaged.
 The possibility that Kogas would do this was contemplated at the time of the transaction and the agreements were structured to enable them to do that,  a Santos spokesman said.
UBS energy analyst Gordon Ramsay said he saw the move merely as Korea Gas managing its risks.  As long as the offtake for the project is covered and there's no increased counter-party risk for Santos, then I'm not too worried,  he said.
But others pointed to the Kogas spokesman cited by Reuters, who said the Korean firm wanted to trim its stake because of  investment costs and a freeze in domestic gas prices .
 It would also seem to go against the general trend of Asian buyers wanting to back their LNG purchases with a reasonable amount of equity in a project,  said Ben Wilson at JPMorgan.
Japan's Mitsubishi, which has an alliance with Kogas to jointly purchase stakes in LNG projects, is seen as an obvious candidate to join the GLNG project and take about 500,000 tonnes a year of LNG.

A syndicate of banks has been pulled together and, while still in its formative stages, will join the trio of JPMorgan, Macquarie and Morgan Stanley that are understood to be in line to manage the equity raising of more than $3 billion required for the proposed Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project in Queensland. (As an aside, talk late yesterday that JPMorgan, Macquarie and Morgan Stanley had each provided a letter of credit of $1 billion was said to be wide of the mark).
 It's not just the $16 billion APLNG project that Origin has to find the funds for but the refinancing of the $3.25 billion of debt that underpinned Origin's recent acquisitions through the NSW privatisation process.

Republic recently used its major shareholding in Innamincka Petroleum to surprisingly torpedo an agreed takeover bid from Drillsearch Energy, and later emerged as the driving force behind a recapitalisation and overhaul of Innamincka. Wavenet, in turn, owns a 15 per cent stake in another coal play Carabella Resources in which Republic is also an investor.

Engenco has a market capitalisation of about $100 million, so a successful raising would result in it almost doubling in size.
Finally, Austock Group is looking to raise $30 million for NuCoal Resources at 55Â¢ a share, an 8 per cent discount to the last traded price. The funds will be used for feasibility studies, working capital and potential acquisitions.

The promise came as Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser forecast an end to the development of coal-fired power stations in the state.
 And the Treasurer said he expected a major turnaround in jobs by the end of the year.
Queensland Gas, which is building a $15 billion gas export facility in Gladstone, harvests millions of litres of underground water as part of its operations.
As part of its environmental approval, the company has to find a beneficial use for the water or reinject it back into underground aquifers.
It is building a water desalination plant outside Chinchilla that will return it to the water cycle where it can be used by farmers for irrigation, industry and towns.
The water treatment plant will have eventual production capacity of up to 100 megalitres a day, which is equivalent to the daily water use of about 20 average-size farms on the Darling Downs.
Mr Fraser, at an American Chamber of Commerce function in Brisbane yesterday, said the numbers involved in gas projects under way in Queensland were enormous.
QGC was spending $1 billion on development even before it gave the Gladstone project the green light.
``It kind of makes the rebuilding of Queensland look like putting a backyard shed together,'' he said.
And he said the development of the gas industry meant there had not been a coal-fired power station built in the state for 10 years.

Ms Baker says she has not seen the results of water tests conducted by Arrow.
 We were concerned that the water was not tested by a independent, third-party laboratory,  she said.
 The samples were taken by Arrow Energy staff and then sent on to a laboratory for testing.
 That sort of self-regulation raises a lot of issues with us. 
In a statement, Arrow Energy says it had Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) permission to release the water.
The ABC has contacted DERM for comment.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The Queensland Government says water released from a coal seam gas (CSG) project into a Western Downs creek does not pose a risk to the environment.
The Department of Environment and Resource Management allowed Arrow Energy to discharge water into Wilkie Creek from its Daandine water storage and treatment facility, north-west of Dalby, during last month's flood emergency.
 One landholder expressed concern about the quality of the water that coursed over her property on the way to the creek.
But DERM spokesman Andrew Brier says the stored water was not harmful and any contaminants would have been further diluted by the floodwater.
 We didn't want them discharging to ground and then it running over ground into a water course unnecessarily or without further research, but the water quality on its own - even without the dilution of floodwaters - was extremely good and posed very little risk to the environmentm: he said.
Mr Brier says the water passed departmental tests.
 The water that's actually been discharged by Arrow and that was approved to be discharged by DERM is the high-quality, treated water from a reverse osmosis plant,  he said.
 It's of a very high quality and a good standard and posed no risk to the environment for its release.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2011,1,"Make It
What's new? Oil Search and its partners continue to execute the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. When big projects are on the go, the basics of production and exploration can sometimes slip. This appeared to be an influencing factor during the September quarter, when Oil Search reported a 5 per cent sequential fall in production.
 The fall was attributed to lower off-take volumes from the Porgera mine and natural field decline. It was nevertheless encouraging to see production gain 1 per cent in the December quarter, rising to 1,864,000 barrels of oil equivalent.
This was enough to push Oil Search's full-year production to 7.66 million barrels, comfortably above the guidance range of 7.2 million-7.4 million barrels.
There is still no escaping the ravages of natural field decline though, with 2010 production down 5.7 per cent from 2009. Management has previously indicated, without quantifying, that the pace of decline should be reduced in future periods. They have now provided more detail on this, with 2011 production guidance of 6.2 million-6.7 million barrels, or a 12.5 per cent-19 per cent decline.
While this hardly represents a slower pace of decline, the accelerated fall is due to work associated with the PNG LNG project. Production facilities will be shut during the second and fourth quarters. Management expects production to increase slightly in 2012 and remain flat in 2013.
The outlook The company's production will be turbocharged as the PNG LNG project gets under way in 2014. The project is the primary factor behind our positive view on the stock.
Work on the project will ramp up considerably this year, as the development process moves into the construction phase. A key aspect of any development of this nature is the employment of local people and the local training centre is now officially open. The centre will equip Papua New Guineans with the skills necessary to fulfil the various construction and transport roles.
Those who complete the training will receive international certification, allowing them to pursue opportunities beyond the PNG LNG project.
Given PNG LNG is still some years away, management must remain focused on securing additional sources of production, so Oil Search has expanded its presence in the Gulf of Papua region. The region is prospective for oil and especially gas but exploration is in its infancy.
Another area of interest is the Huria prospect, which could potentially hold multitrillion-cubic-metre gas reservoirs. The company plans to target drilling at Huria in the 2011 fourth quarter.
Share price After breaking out of a bullish ascending triangle in late September 2010, Oil Search surged to a record high of $7.20 in late December 2010.
Since then a short-term pullback has followed. Downside support is initially located at $6.40, although broader momentum remains to the upside.
Worth buying?
With PNG LNG production still three to four years off, Oil Search will remain susceptible to broader market sell-offs. It is during these periods that opportunities are created to increase or open up exposure to the company. We recommend the stock as a hold.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"LNG HOBART, Feb 17 AAP - Australia's first liquified natural gas (LNG) micro-plant has opened in northern Tasmania.
The BOC plan opened in Westbury on Thursday cost $150 million, which came from private investment and government grants.
 Capable of producing 50 tonnes a day, the plant will supply six LNG truck refuelling stations across northern Tasmania.
Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings spruiked the values of LNG as a greener alternative to other fossil fuels.
 LNG as a fuel source offers considerable advantages over conventional diesel fuel,  Ms Giddings said.
 It offers significant economic and environmental benefits and is a clean burning fuel that also has much lower levels of other pollutants. 
Federal Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said he hoped the Westbury plant would serve as a blueprint for a national network.
 LNG is emerging as an effective solution for the Australian haulage industry in both commercial and environmental terms,  Mr Ferguson said.
 A major hurdle for LNG as a transport fuel has been the absence of a distribution network.
 Developments such as this micro-plant and associated supply infrastructure reduce the chicken and egg nexus between fuel and vehicle supply that has stymied the uptake of LNG in the past.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"SANTOS By Greg Roberts
MELBOURNE, Feb 17 AAP - Santos Ltd is in a strong position to benefit from negotiating higher natural gas prices from energy-strapped customers by linking it to oil prices, analysts say.
 The gas and oil producer, which is already banking its future on demand for natural gas in Asia, on Thursday announced a full year net profit of $500 million, up 15.2 per cent increase on the prior year.
The company's underlying profit was $376 million, up 46.3 per cent.
A fully franked dividend of 15 cents per share was declared, bringing the full year total to 37 cents.
Santos is Australia's third largest oil and gas producer and largest domestic gas producer.
Four new gas and oil ventures that come online this year would boost production levels by 20 per cent by the end of 2012, from 50 million barrels a year to 60 million, Santos chief executive David Knox said.
That comes before the major expansion of projects. It has stakes in the $US16 billion ($A15.96 billion) Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) project - approved last month - and the Papua New Guinea LNG project, to come online around 2015.
 The company performed well in 2010, it was a good result that supports our focus in recent years, building our base business,  Mr Knox told reporters.
However, production fell eight per cent to 49.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, with wet weather in the Cooper Basin of South Australia causing the loss of 2.9 million barrels and a $157 million writedown.
Santos expects to produce between 48 million and 52 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2011.
Santos shares closed up 44 cents, or 3.19 per cent, at $14.24.
UBS analyst Gordon Ramsay said the company was in a strong position to benefit from negotiating higher natural gas prices by linking it to oil price that economies short on natural gas would be forced to pay.
 They (Santos) need the higher price to justify the cost of building LNG plant projects and exporting it to buyers,  he told AAP.
 LNG by nature is a more expensive way of delivering gas, countries like Japan and China doesn't have enough of their own resources and don't have much alternative if they want a clean burning fuel such as natural gas used for industry or power generation in particular.
 What you are seeing are LNG markets growing quite strongly in South East Asia and globally ... Santos is not alone. 
Mr Ramsay said the Gladstone project in Queensland - which could produce up to 7.8 million tonnes of LNG a year - would be a  litmus test  as it would be using coal seam gas and methane to produce LNG for the first time.
Full year revenue for Santos lifted 2.2 per cent to $2.23 billion, with natural gas accounting for 50 per cent of that amount, LNG four per cent and other gas, liquid and oil for the other 46 per cent.
 What you are going to see is LNG playing a much more significant role and any new gas contracts they sign, they will look for some - if they can get it - oil indexation on pricing,  Mr Ramsay said.
Higher commodity prices included $US87.35 per barrel of oil, 11 per cent higher than 2009, while the average gas price of $US4.31 per gigajoule was five per cent higher.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"Crackdown on coal seam gas drilling
A COALITION policy that tightens controls on mining and gas explor-ation licences has been welcomed on the Northern Rivers, but some say it does not go far enough.
 The NSW Opposition has promised to apply a tougher assessment process to mining and coal seam gas extraction if elected in next month's State election, incl-uding a moratorium for all new mine and gas licences for up to a year.
The policy would mean a more cautious approach to granting exploration licences, explicit agriculture impact assessments and more comprehensive monitoring of aquifers.
The current â€œmining rushâ€? has caused controversy across regional NSW, with particular fears about â€œfraccingâ€? â€“ the process of fracturing rock to release trapped gas â€“ and the impact it could have on underground water resources.
Lismore City Council recently voted to back a moratorium on coal seam mining, following exploratory drilling by Arrow Energy at Keerrong, near The Channon.
Arrow has said it might never do serious drilling here, but has set up infrastructure including a weatherproof road, leading residents to speculate the company plans to return.
Keerrong protesters say expansion of the relatively new coal seam gas industry is occurring too rapidly and without safeguards, and no one is really aware of the dangers. Greens candidate for Lismore, Sue Stock, said she was yet to read the detail of the Coalition's policy, but on the face of it saw it as a welcome development.
â€œI welcome a policy which allows for agricultural impact statements and better assessment of new exp-loration licences with a one-year moratorium. I welcome the fact that there will be more comprehensive monitoring of aquifers, particularly where multiple gas projects have been proposed,â€? she said.
Janine O'Brien, of Keerrong, said she welcomed any policy that tightened environmental controls of proposed mines and gas fields, but there was also a need to consider the social environment.The Nature Conservation Council of NSW said the Coalition's â€œcautious approachâ€? would provide a prime opportunity to find the best way of protecting natural areas and human communities from the destructive impacts of the â€œunprecedented expansion in coal and gas exploration and mining taking place across NSWâ€?.
â€œTighter controls of proposed mines and gas fields and active monitoring of waterways are all part of the solution. But they will only be effective if the groundwork is laid with strong strategic planning that avoids mining development in our water supply catchments and places of high conservation value,â€? CEO Pepe Clarke said.
â€œThe next NSW government should identify water supplies and areas of high environmental or agricultural value that are vulnerable to the threat of mining imp-acts and make them permanently off-limits to open cut and long wall mining and coal seam gas extraction.â€?
The Northern Rivers Greens are screening the film Gasland, which documents the bad experiences of coal seam gas drilling in the US, at Kyogle next Thursday.
"
APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"EVEN putting aside the question of chemicals, protesters say the practice of hydraulic fracturing â€“ or â€œfraccingâ€? â€“ in coal seam gas drilling can have a dramatic impact on water quality.
Opponents at a recent gathering of Keerrong residents and Northern Rivers Greens members, along with Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann, said one of the chief concerns arose when a drill hole cut through an underground pool of water, or aquifer.
 In the worst cases, the drill hole might cut through salt and fresh-water aquifers. The water from the two bodies of water would mingle and the freshwater be spoiled by the saltwater.
However, there were significant issues even where only a single freshwater aquifer was penetrated by a coal seam gas drill.
In that circumstance, protesters feared methane gas could leak around the drill shaft, dissolving into water within the aquifer and creating the flammable water made infamous in the US documentary, Gasland.
Metgasco, which is drilling for coal seam gas around Casino, says it has avoided this problem with a commitment to avoid aquifers when drilling for gas.
Metgasco and Arrow Energy, the other coal seam gas company with a presence on the Northern Rivers, have said they will not use the toxic chemicals highlighted in Gasland in their Australian operations.
Arrow has said chemicals made up 0.5 per cent of the sand and water mix it used when â€œfraccingâ€?.
On its website, Arrow says it uses food grade acetic acid (the basis of vinegar, also used in herbicides), gutaraldehyde (used to disinfect medical equipment), surfactants (used in soaps and toothpaste), cellulose (used in wallpaper paste and paper), bactericides (to inhibit the formation of bacteria that may corrode steel and cement well casings, also used in agricultural treatment of crops), and guar gum (from the guar bean, vegetable gum used in ice-cream, also fed to cattle).
Arrow says those chemicals can be toxic in large quantities, but the levels it uses them at are too small to cause any major concern.

After a recent stretch of positive data releases, US retail sales for January
disappointed markets. Total retail sales and retail sales excluding automobiles
rose 0.3 per cent, which was 0.2 per cent less than most expectations. Although
it is tempting to ascribe the lower figure to snowstorms throughout much of the
US in January, the link is not as straightforward, JPMorgan analysts wrote. In
February 2009, a month of record wild weather, core retail sales increased the
most in four years.
Mixed results
Economic growth in the G4 economies (US, euro area, Japan and the UK) have
varied widely for the December quarter. Euro zone gross domestic product rose
0.3 per cent, whereas UK GDP fell 2 per cent, although JPMorgan said this
appears more weatherrelated
than a fundamental disruption in the recovery.
Japan also experienced a contraction, but has had the strongest recovery of the

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"NATURAL gas distributor Envestra will spend $600 million on its ageing gas networks in South Australia and Queensland following a ruling by the Australian Energy Regulator giving the green light to its capital expenditure plans.
But while Envestra managing director Ian Little said the interim AER decision was a ``good start'', he said the company would challenge some key parts of the ruling, describing them as ``superficial'' and ``ill-conceived''.
 ``There is some amazingly superficial analysis,'' Mr Little said. ``It is a good start but it is surprising that some parts of the decision are so ill-conceived.''
The spending program includes the progressive replacement of about 1300km of ageing gas pipes across Envestra's networks in South Australian and Queensland, and $507m will be spent in South Australia to replace older gas mains to reduce leakage. Envestra applied last year to allow it to increase tariffs in South Australia by 10 per cent and Queensland by 8 per cent every year for five years from July 1 this year. But the AER's draft decision will see an increase in retail tariffs in South Australia of about 4 per cent for the year post July 1. Increases would then average about 3 per cent a year for the next four years.
The AER said yesterday this would see a South Australian customer's annual bill increase on average by $26 each year compared with $45 each year if the AER had accepted Envestra's proposal in full. Mr Little said Envestra would challenge the AER's ruling on a number of issues, including Envestra's level of operating costs in Queensland, gas pricing and the AER's refusal to allow it to recoup payments to contractors through higher tariffs.
``These are worth $25m over the life of the agreement,'' Mr Little said.
The regulator's final decision will be handed down in May. The AER also yesterday released a ruling on a tariff increase proposed by rival distributor APT Allgas in Queensland. APT Allgas proposed a real increase in network charges for residential customers of 11 per cent as at July 1, then averaging 6 per cent per year over the same five-year period.
But the AER said the proposed tariffs were too high and the terms and conditions too much in favour of APT Allgas.
Instead, the increases approved by the AER would see a customer's annual bill increase by $20 a year compared with $28 a year if the AER had accepted APT Allgas's proposal in full.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"OIL and gas group Santos yesterday reported a resilient full-year profit for 2010 of $376 million, after adjustments, but neatly demonstrated why liquefied natural gas production has become flavour of the month for Australian gas producers.
Santos's bottom line result was $500 million, after it took into account significant profits from selling down its interests in its $18 billion Gladstone LNG project (GLNG).
 Perhaps the most important line in its results announcement was that, by 2015, 70 per cent of its production would be ``exposed to oil prices''.
That compares with only 27 per cent in 2010, according to its results presentation.
The big rise in ``oil price exposure'' will come from GLNG - which, once it comes on-line, will significantly lift the price per unit of gas Santos receives over the prices it now gets for most of its gas, which is sold in domestic markets.
Domestic gas prices, except in Western Australia, are about a third less than those available in world markets but, through LNG sales, are linked - by a number of complex formulas - to the oil price. And, by 2014 or early 2015, GLNG will be selling 7.8 million tonnes a year of LNG.
Santos will also be gaining further oil price exposure from its stakes in the PNG LNG plant - being built by an ExxonMobil-led consortium - as well as from stakes in Darwin's LNG operation.
Santos yesterday said it had booked a net profit of $500 million after tax for the year ended December 31, 15 per cent higher than the previous year.
Underlying net profit of $376 million was up 46 per cent on the previous year due to higher product prices and lower exploration expense.
The 2010 headline result includes a $214 million profit after tax from asset sales.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"Crossing highways and rivers to supply gas
A 280-KILOMETRE pipeline from Coolah to supply the state's first liquefied natural gas export terminal in the Port of Newcastle will make numerous crossings of creeks and rivers in its path through the Hunter, plans from Eastern Star Gas show.
 A project application lodged with the NSW Department of Planning said the high-pressure gas pipeline would stem from the Narrabri to Wellington pipeline adjacent to Coolah, linking the proposed terminal at Kooragang Island to the company's Narrabri coal seam gas project.
The pipeline to Newcastle would run from Coolah, crossing the Hunter River for the first time east of Denman, cut through Lake Liddell and travel through the areas of Dyrring, Mitchells Flat, Elderslie, Stanhope, Hillsborough, Gosforth and Maitland Vale, before passing through Largs, Morpeth, Woodberry, Tarro and Hexham.
The pipeline would cross seven highways and five railway lines.
The company entered into a memorandum of understanding with Hitachi and Toyo Engineering to conduct a technical and financial feasibility study for the construction of a 1 million tonne a year liquefied natural gas plant on Kooragang Island.
The plant would have the potential to expand to 4 million tonnes, under a joint venture between Eastern Star Gas and Santos.
The pipeline would also supply natural gas to Hexham, which would enable it to tie into the existing NSW gas grid and improve security of supply for Newcastle and Sydney.
It could also potentially supply Bayswater power station.
The project application said demand for gas in Newcastle and Sydney might exceed supply from 2013 and Sydney customers  have already suffered supply interruptions .
The company said the export terminal project would be worth up to $2.5 billion if fully developed, including a pipeline to the site.
The Greens have criticised the proposed export terminal and said its approval would be a green light for coal seam gas projects across the state, despite limited oversight of the industry and community concern.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"There has been plenty of talk about the idea of BHP Billiton making a bid for Woodside Petroleum since Royal Dutch Shell sold down its stake in November.
But one theory now circulating is that BHP is more likely a seller of its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia than a buyer of Woodside and its relatively high-risk development portfolio.
 After a meeting with BHP chief commercial officer Alberto Calderon after the release of the miner's record profits on Wednesday, Macquarie Equities analyst Adrian Wood came away with the impression that LNG projects were not particularly high on the BHP agenda.
BHP unveiled plans to spend $US15 billion on petroleum over the next five years, but that would just cover the costs of expansions in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bass Strait, leaving very little surplus for the Scarborough or Browse LNG projects. BHP's share of the capital costs of those LNG projects could be around $US14 billion.
If BHP isn't going to develop the projects in the next five years, it stands to reason it might consider a divestment. One issue is that Woodside is the most likely buyer, but it doesn't have the balance sheet capacity to make the acquisitions or fund its share of the development costs.
However, there could be plenty of interest from Chinese and Indian buyers looking to gain control of supply â€“ and it's worth noting BHP is not the operator of either project.
That in itself is part of the reason why the projects may be less attractive for BHP. The company made it clear on Wednesday that it wants more operating experience. Its only LNG interest in production, the North-West Shelf, is operated by Woodside.
Wood thinks BHP has taken a more cautious tone on the outlook for LNG. The company apparently thinks US shale breaks even at a gas price of $US4 per million British thermal units (Btu), while Australian LNG requires an upstream netback correctof $US8 per million Btu.
That spread may only widen as capital costs continue to rise in WA and make the idea of selling those interests to buy into the US shale market worth pondering.

Santos chief executive David Knox has moved swiftly to head off perceptions that the company lacks growth options ahead of the start-up of its big-ticket liquefied natural gas projects, forecasting a 20 per cent jump in output over the next two years.
 While flooding in the Cooper Basin threatened to keep production mostly flat this year, the start-up of oil and gas fields in Western Australia and South-East Asia could take output to about 60 million barrels of oil equivalent by the end of 2012, up from 49.9 million BOE last year, Mr Knox said.
Santos had higher prices to thank for a 46 per cent surge in underlying net profit in 2010 to $376 million, despite an 8 per cent slide in output. The number was about 3 per cent above market consensus.
Headline net profit rose 15 per cent to $500 million as a $214 million gain on asset sales was partly offset by $123 million of write-downs, mostly on the Cooper Basin oil assets and shuttered oil projects in northwest Australia.
The divestments included a 15 per cent stake in the GLNG venture in Queensland that Santos sold in September to France's Total, with a similar sale in December to be recognised in the 2011 accounts.
While the headline numbers held few surprises, Santos shares added 3.2 per cent to $14.24, their highest close for almost six months.
Santos confirmed a final dividend of 15Â¢ a share, down from 20Â¢ a year earlier, in line with its revised policy announced in December to reduce dividends to conserve funds for growth projects.
News of a gas find at Apache's Zola exploration well in WA, in which Santos has a stake, helped drive the gain, the biggest for eight weeks.
 What's important is that they do show some production growth in their projections before Gladstone, whereas people have had a view that it's all about Papua New Guinea LNG and GLNG,  said Stuart Baker, energy analyst at Morgan Stanley.
 Given where the company was a couple of years ago and the forecasts back then, their situation has materially improved. 
The $US15 billion PNG LNG project is due to start production in 2014, and GLNG the following year.
Mr Knox also pointed to the increasing share of Santos's production that will be indexed in future against crude oil prices, a trend he said was transforming the company.
The share of output that would gain from higher oil prices would rise in 2015, from just over a quarter last year, as not just LNG contracts but an increasing number of domestic gas sales contracts in WA were indexed against crude, he said.
Santos is seeking to lock in more sales contracts for its $1.08 billion Reindeer gas project with Apache, in addition to deals done with CITIC Pacific and Rio Tinto.
That project is due to start production in the second half, as is the Chim Sao oil venture with Premier Oil in Vietnam. The Wortel gasfield in Indonesia will begin by the year-end.
Next year's expected production gain would be higher were it not for the delay at the Kipper project in the Bass Strait, which had also run hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and which Mr Knox described as  very disappointing .
While Santos is now hoping Kipper will start in 2013, that has yet to be confirmed.
Mr Knox blamed the delay on the Gippsland joint venture partners ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton, which have yet to resolve the engineering for bringing Kipper gas to their platform. Last year, flooding in the Cooper Basin cut 2.9 million BOE from production, resulting in a $39 million hit to net profit.
Santos is assuming a continuing impact on output this year, which Mr Knox said was already factored into the 2011 guidance of 48 million to 52 million BOE.
But drilling at the coal seam gasfields in Queensland for GLNG, which was halted by flooding in January, has resumed and all rigs are now operating. Some 100 to 120 wells are planned there this year.
Mr Knox said it was too early to talk of an expansion at the $US16 billion GLNG project, despite BG Group last week setting an aggressive April 2012 target for a go-ahead to enlarge its rival venture, also on Gladstone's Curtis Island.
Spending by Santos on the Gladstone project and on the PNG venture will total $2 billion this year, helping lift the 2011 capital expenditure budget by more than half to $3 billion.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"GAS CANBERRA, Feb 21 AAP - Chemicals linked with the production of coal seam gas have not been evaluated by the national regulator, a chemical management specialist says.
As expansion in the coal seam gas industry continues to boom, fears grow that the groundwater of Great Artesian Basin will be poisoned.
 Dr Mariann Lloyd-Smith, an adviser to the federal government's National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), said environmental applications by the Queensland Gas Company (QGC) contained out of date and deficient safety data.
QGC is a coal seam gas explorer and producer.
 I've had a look at the application and what is of concern - the manufacturer's safety data sheets, or the material safety data sheets they include, they are certainly not the Australian standard and as such they are in breach of both the Queensland Act and the national code for material safety data sheets,  Dr Lloyd-Smith told ABC Television.
Coal seam gas occurs when methane and other gases are released when pressure on the coal seam is reduced, usually by removal of water from the seam.
Dr Lloyd-Smith said two of the 23 most commonly used compounds in fracturing fluids had been assessed by NICNAS, but their evaluation was not for that particular purpose.
 So you can basically say of the 23 major chemicals used in this process, they have not been assessed by any national regulator,  she said.
A principal hydrologist for 13 years with the Queensland government, John Hillier, said he had concerns about the impact of the coal seam gas industry would have on the Great Artesian Basin.
Mr Hillier said around 95 per cent of the gas wells expected to be built would be of a satisfactory standard but issues could arise from the rest.
Federal Environment and Water Minister Tony Burke said thresholds on water extraction had been set in the Great Artesian Basin, which was the basis for his approval of the $31 billion Santos and QGC coal seam gas projects.
 My conditions say so test them all and then apply the rules based on what each test says for each seam and if every seam comes out with connectivity, then re-pressurisation or re-injection of water, no matter how expensive, will end up being the pathway that is followed and that's exactly what should happen,  Mr Burke said.
The $35 billion Origin and ConocoPhillips Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project in southern Queensland has received the tick from the state government but awaits approval from the Commonwealth.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"WOODSIDE PERTH, Feb 21 AAP - Woodside Petroleum Ltd says cyclones and wet weather have hampered construction of its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project on Western Australia's North West Shelf.
Construction of the first stage of the Pluto project is currently more than 95 per cent complete.
 The company originally targeted project start-up by the end of this month.
However, industrial action last year hampered construction, forcing Woodside to push the date back to August 2011.
Chief executive Don Voelte told a teleconference on Monday that an unusually high number of cyclones in the northwest region had resulted in about 20 days of productivity being lost from the Pluto construction schedule.
 Offshore, it has been rough as hell. The port has been shut down several times and it's been raining cats and dogs up there,  Mr Voelte told analysts and reporters.
 The north west has been going through quite a bit of hell. It's very unusual.
 The bottom line is we have lost about 20 days of productivity.
 We're doing things to mitigate around that, but at this late stage in the project, it might be hard to make up any or all of that time.
 So we're going to give it our best shot. 
Production from Woodside's Enfield oil field on the North West Shelf remains suspended after being shut-in last Wednesday in response to tropical cyclone Dianne, a company spokeswoman said.
The cyclone warning for Dianne for the northwest coast region was cancelled on Friday, but another is on the way.
On Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology said Tropical Cyclone Carlos was over open waters west of Broome and should move west-southwest roughly parallel to the Pilbara coast, gradually intensify until Tuesday.
Woodside on Monday said production from another North West Shelf asset, its Cossack Pioneer floating production, storage and offtake vessel, had also been suspended.
Production from its Vincent oil field, near Enfield, remained shut-in due to a planned shutdown to return the B Compressor to service, the spokeswoman said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The company behind a $15 billion coal seam gas development in Queensland is being investigated for damaging an underground water source within the Great Artesian Basin system, Monday's Four Corners program reveals.
The incident was uncovered by a sleuthing Queensland farmer, Anne Bridle, as she investigated rumours of a fracking mishap near her beef and grain property in Dalby.
 Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves blasting a mixture of water, sand and diluted chemicals into a well to help open coal seams, increasing gas production.
The problems arose when Queensland Gas Company (QGC) fracked its Myrtle 3 well, connecting the Springbok aquifer to the coal seam below, the Walloon Coal Measures, in 2009.
Ms Bridle has raised several concerns: that chemicals used in the process - which included 130 litres of THPS - may have migrated into the water supply; that water from the different aquifers could intermingle, affecting the water quality; and also that water levels in the aquifer could fall.
The company did not alert authorities or nearby water users about the problem until 13 months after the incident.
 Ultimately there's no-one checking to see what happens under the ground. The accountability is not there,  Mrs Bridle said.
Worried about her own cattle, she probed further but found the safety data sheet QGC had submitted for the fracking chemical THPS was American, incomplete and 10 years out of date.
Chemical management expert Mariann Lloyd-Smith also examined the documents and believes the company may be in breach of the national safety code governing toxic chemicals.
Federal and state government regulators put a total of 1,500 conditions on QGC's Curtis LNG Project when they approved it late last year.
But Dr Lloyd-Smith believes the company's safety sheets - used in its recent Environment Authority application - are not up to scratch.
Under a national code, safety data sheets on chemicals used must contain information on Australian emergency contacts and regulations and be written within the past five years.
QGC says it does not believe it has breached the regulations.
After extensive testing, Mrs Brindle's cattle were cleared of any contamination - their water had come from a different aquifer.
'Relatively minor'
In a statement, QGC said interconnectivity between the two bodies existed naturally before drilling. However, during drilling the company  unintentionally provided a route for water in the aquifer  to enter the well, adding the water flow had been  relatively minor .
Monitoring had indicated there had been no impact on the water source's quality or levels and steps were being taken to fix the problem, it said.
 QGC believes the risk to human health or to water supply, or to both, have been negligible,  the statement said.
 Notwithstanding, QGC understands the Bridles' fears and is doing all it reasonably can to alleviate them. 
The Queensland Government - which on Friday announced the establishment of its new LNG enforcement unit - is still investigating the 2009 fracking incident.
 Any company that thinks they can get away with not informing the appropriate authorities when things go awry can expect to be investigated and appropriate punishment... to be meted out,  Energy Minister Stephen Robertson said. Monday's Four Corners looks at the daily realities behind Queensland's burgeoning new coal seam gas industry, and meets farmers on the ground whose lives have unwittingly become caught up in the gas boom.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke is due to announce his decision on Origin Energy's and ConocoPhillips's $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project by tomorrow, but it will take more than that to shake the market's uneasiness on the project.
Given the significance of the project to Queensland, and the fact Burke has already approved both the Santos-led Gladstone LNG project and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG development, it's hard to see Burke doing anything other than approving it.
 While that will certainly be an important milestone for APLNG, particularly in light of the hard time the partners copped when cancer-causing chemicals were detected in some of their coal seam gas wells, it will do little to address the biggest question mark still hanging over the proposed project.
In effect, Burke's approval will leave Origin and Conoco with one less excuse to hide behind. The real issue is the lack of customers signed up to buy LNG from the project. Without buyers on board, the project won't be able to attract funding and won't be able to get off the ground.
Indian company Petronet has been increasingly talking up its desire to source LNG from Australia, while Street Talk has previously reported rumours of Sinopec looking into buying cargoes from APLNG, but nothing has been signed so far.
Both BG and Santos secured the first offtake agreements for their projects about 18 months before they reached final investment decisions. Origin and ConocoPhillips had originally looked to approve the project at the end of last year, but pushed that back.
The lack of progress with customers would be tricky enough on its own, yet in Origin's case, it is also complicating how it puts together its broader financing needs.
Origin wants a single equity raising to contribute to both its recent NSW power acquisitions and its APLNG capital expenditure costs, but investors will be reluctant to fork out cash for APLNG without the project having reached a final investment decision.
For that reason, it seems unlikely that Origin will go on with the equity raising when it releases its results on Thursday.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Woodside chief executive Don Voelte says he doesn't care if the oil and gas company is forced to compete against its partners in the North-West Shelf gas project, despite enjoying an exemption from doing so.
The startling comments come less than six months after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ruled that the shelf partners â€“ including Woodside, Chevron, BP, BHP Billiton and Shell â€“ could continue to jointly market and sell natural gas to West Australians for at least another five years.
 Mr Voelte said his personal opinion differed from the views of the gas producing partners.
 I couldn't care less if we were forced to market separately,  he said.  In fact, I think we should and I think prices would go down. 
The Woodside-led venture has consistently argued that any move to force separate marketing at the Pilbara project would create commercial risks that could lead to increased prices and threaten future supplies.
Gas buyers argue that normal competition theory dictates prices would fall if the producers were forced to compete for customer gas contracts.
Prices for West Australian businesses renegotiating gas contracts have jumped from $3 to â€Š$4 a gigajoule to $8â€Što $9 a gigajoule in the past two years, putting energy prices in the state among the highest in the country.
The Shelf project is crucial to the state as natural gas accounts for half of the primary energy consumed there, according to government data.
The partners have engaged in collective pricing since starting the project in the mid 1980s. Mr Voelte declined a request to expand on his comments, which are at odds with the decades-old stance of the project owners.
The operators of the massive Gorgon liquefied natural gas project enjoy ACCC authorisation, which is in effect an exemption from normal competition rules.
A Chevron spokesman said it was too early to tell whether the Chevron-led Wheatstone LNG project would apply for the authorisation.
 We won't be finalising our domestic gas marketing arrangements for Wheatstone until we get closer to a final investment decision,  the spokesman said.
ACCC representatives were in Perth last year holding meetings with gas producers and buyers ahead of its decision.
Tony Petersen, the chairman of the state's energy users' group, DomGas Alliance, said he was disappointed by the decision, which locked Western Australia into  less competition and higher gas prices for the next 20 years .
Mr Voelte's comments come at a time when many West Australian families are under financial pressure, with power prices in the resource-rich state soaring by almost 50 per cent over the past two years after the state government cut decades-old Â­subsidies.
The state Treasury assumes that prices will rise another 22 per cent this year to bring bills in line with the cost of producing power.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"LNG BRISBANE, Feb 22 AAP - The federal environment minister has approved a $35 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Central Queensland despite fears it could poison the Great Artesian Basin.
The Australia Pacific LNG project at Gladstone has been given the green-light under strict environmental conditions, Environment and Water Minister Tony Burke said in a statement on Tuesday.
 Mr Burke said detailed ongoing monitoring of the Great Artesian Basin and  early warnings  of any contamination of groundwater were required.
 After a rigorous assessment, which sought the advice of experts and included public consultation, I have concluded that the Australia Pacific LNG project can go ahead without unacceptable impacts on matters protected under national environment law,  Mr Burke said.
The joint Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips project to convert coal seam gas (CSG) to LNG is expected to generate hundreds of jobs for Queensland.
However, chemical and water experts say chemicals linked with the production of CSG have not been evaluated by the national regulator.

Mr Burke said thresholds on water extraction had been set in the Basin, which was the basis for his approval of similar projects by Santos and QGC.
He said companies must submit water management and monitoring plans detailing impacts on aquifers, groundwater and surface water.
 Water pressure must be maintained above conservative thresholds that will be set on the advice of experts. Should these be exceeded, the companies must have plans ready to re-establish pressure, through re-injection or other means,  Mr Burke said.
 In making my decision, I considered the potential impacts on agricultural land, and have set strict environmental conditions to ensure water resources are properly managed to protect nationally significant matters. 
The approval also includes conditions to protect threatened species and ecosystems, including migratory birds and national and world heritage values.
Mr Burke said to offset  unavoidable  impacts on Curtis Island where LNG facilities are based, companies must set aside an area five times the size of their project sites for national park.
He said any dredging will be subject to strict conditions to minimise impacts on marine species and water quality.

He said it was ironic to see minister Stephen Robertson on the program, defending his department's decisions about the CSG industry on the same day the mining portfolio was taken from him in a cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Finlay said the new minister for mining, Stirling Hinchliffe, must immediately bring himself up to speed regarding regional and rural communities' concerns about CSG.
 ... we look forward to his leadership on ensuring the science behind CSG is right before any more resource extraction takes place,  he said.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"GAS PERTH, Feb 22 AAP - A leading environment group in Western Australia has called on the state government to impose a moratorium on the extraction of coal seam gas (CSG).
The Conservation Council of WA (CCWA) says the state should be declared a CSG-free zone in light of the disastrous impacts  fracking  is having on water tables and communities in Queensland and NSW.
 Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals underground to fracture rock and release coal seam gas.
The CCWA also cites information from the National Toxics Network that fracking chemicals have never been tested for safety.
Campaigns coordinator Louise Morris said drilling operations to begin fracking were taking place in the Perth Basin, Wellington Dam, Busselton and in WA's north.
 Companies such as Westralian Gas and Power are moving forward with CSG fracking operations in the hope of developing commercial CSG mining, utilising a cocktail of chemicals in our aquifers that have not been disclosed to the public,  she said.
 The water supply of our towns and small communities cannot be put at risk for such short sighted exploitation of previously unviable CSG deposits.

 Concerns were raised about the regulation of chemicals used in the production of coal seam gas.
While the majority of coal seam gas is produced in Queensland, resource companies are also exploring other states.
The program looked at allegations about the contamination of a major aquifer on a Queensland property.

Mariann Lloyd-Smith is an adviser to the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme and agrees it is a concern.
She says many of the chemicals used are highly toxic and dangerous and aren't regulated.
 Of the 23 major chemicals used in this process, they have not been assessed by any national regulator,  she said.
The Queensland Government is investigating the incident

 The water in the Hunter Valley, it feeds into the Hunter River, which in turn feeds the water system for Newcastle itself.
 In the Illawarra where we have more gas development, those water systems feed into Sydney.
 When you affect the water in one place, it affects it everywhere and putting water at risk by letting this industry unfettered is just unthinkable.
 We've got to put a moratorium in place, we've got to get independent experts to take a look at this industry in its totality and then we've got to look at everything from legislation to regulation.

Delegates from member councils last week voted to support the New South Wales Farmers' call for a halt to mining until adequate environmental studies are carried out.
 Rous Water's technical services director, Wayne Franklin, says the authority was not notified before exploratory drilling was recently carried out at Eltham, near its Wilsons River pumping station.
 There is no consultation before any of these processes are carried out and that's quite different to how normal development occurs,  Mr Franklin said.
 If a normal development wants to occur they either lodge a development application with the local council or, if it's a large undertaking through the State Government, and there is significant consultation,  he said.
Lismore City councillor David Yarnall says the state is in the grip of a gas rush, and a precautionary principle should apply.
 The problem is when you do things quickly and we've seen that with government programs in the past, mistakes can happen, unintentionally or not,  Cr Yarnall said.
 I think we only have to look at what happened with BP in the Gulf of Mexico where they weren't prepared for the worst-case scenario,  he said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The Federal Government has granted Origin Energy environmental approval for its coal seam gas (CSG) joint venture with Conoco Phillips north of Gladstone in central Queensland.
Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke says the project will not cause an unacceptable impact.
 It includes the gradual development of the gas field over 30 years, a 450-kilometre transmission pipeline and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on Curtis Island.
Meanwhile, the CSG industry says it is happy to be subjected to rigorous regulation and public scrutiny.
Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association spokesman Ross Dunn says media attention is good for the industry.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"OIL and gas producer Woodside Petroleum lifted sales by 20 per cent in 2010, despite lower production, and remains bullish about medium-term demand for liquefied natural gas.
Woodside, which yesterday reported a record net profit of $1.57 billion, up 6.9 per cent, expressed a view on the LNG market, which will be hugely encouraging to Queensland's LNG hopefuls.
 In his results presentation, outgoing chief executive Don Voelte said the world consumed about 210 million tonnes of LNG in 2010. By 2025, demand could be between 390 million tonnes and 460 million tonnes, Mr Voelte said.
``Put simply, if you have any spare LNG over at least the next 15 years, you will easily find a willing buyer,'' he said.
That statement will be music to the ears of BG Group and Santos, who are gearing up to build $18 billion LNG projects on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour, which they hope will be producing in 2014-15.
And perhaps it will be even more encouraging to Origin Energy and its US partner ConocoPhillips, who, unlike BG and Santos, are yet to announce any sales agreements for their similar LNG project, also planned for Curtis Island.
Mr Voelte said the LNG market had been well supplied in 2010, due to the slowdown in demand caused by the global financial crisis.
But he said from 2011, Woodside expected the market global market ``to tighten'' leading up ``to the 2015 (start-up) of the next tranche of new supply currently under construction''.
Woodside's Pluto LNG project in Western Australia is about 95 per cent complete.
But production, once scheduled to start at the end of this month, was delayed by industrial action last year, forcing Woodside to push the date back to August 2011.
And Mr Voelte said that an unusually high number of cyclones in WA's northwest region had seen another 20 days added to Pluto's construction schedule.
``Offshore, it has been rough as hell. The port has been shut down several times and it's been raining cats and dogs up there,  Mr Voelte said. Woodside expects its production in the current year to match 2010's output, which produced revenue of $US4.19 billion, up 20 per cent on the previous year because of higher prices and despite lower sales volumes.
Woodside sold 72.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2010, down from 80.7 million barrels in the previous year.
Woodside has sold some production acreage and some of its other oil and gas fields are declining. It said yesterday its underlying production target for 2011 was in the range of 63-66 million barrels, plus between five and nine million barrels from Pluto.
Woodside declared a final dividend of US55, taking its full-year dividends to $US1.05.
Meanwhile, in the light of Shell Australia's sale of some of its Woodside holding in November, the group said Shell-nominated directors on its board would be reduced from three to two.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"POLITICAL LANDSCAPE : NSW
THE Coalition should have seized the  simple solution  and immediately ruled out coal seam gas exploration in winegrowing areas of the Hunter in its new land-use policy, the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance says.
 The Coalition unveiled its land use policy recently, and is tipped to announce soon its royalties for regions scheme for returning a percentage of mining royalties for infrastructure investment.
The land-use policy involves drawing up regional plans to resolve conflicts between industries including viticulture, mining and horse breeding. During a  transition period  of up to a year, tougher assessment requirements would apply to exploration licences and residents would be given a say.
Most stakeholders said the policy was a positive step but reserved their judgment until the details of the regional plan are known.
But the Hunter Valley Protection Alliance said it was concerned that exploration in winegrowing areas wasn't ruled out under the policy, leaving the alliance  completely underwhelmed .
Alliance chairman Graeme Gibson said AGL's exploration licence PEL 267, which encompasses Broke, would expire in January 2012 and the exploration area would need to be reduced for the licence to be renewed.
Mr Gibson said the alliance had emailed Upper Hunter Nationals MP George Souris to urge that a Coalition government tell AGL to exclude Broke Fordwich and Pokolbin from its exploration area in the future.
Asked yesterday of the alliance's concerns, Mr Souris declined to comment.
He also declined to comment on how he considered the Coalition's policy would apply to areas such as Broke.
Independent Upper Hunter candidate Tim Duddy said yesterday he believed coal seam gas exploration should be stopped until further research into the industry's impacts was done.

Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte has failed to shift uncertainty about the company's next wave of liquefied natural gas production growth despite reporting record annual earnings and flagging new growth in the existing gas business.
 In what may be his last profit announcement before stepping down later this year, Mr Voelte stuck by his target of a go-ahead this year for the eagerly awaited expansion of the $14 billion Pluto LNG venture in Western Australia. He was also bullish about prospects for the controversial Browse and Sunrise LNG ventures.
But yesterday analysts pointed to a lack of obvious progress on Browse and Sunrise, while investors were left hungry for information about plans for Mr Voelte's successor.
Woodside's headline 2010 earnings were in line with expectations, with record output from the North West Shelf venture helping drive net income up 6.9 per cent to a record $US1.58 billion. Underlying profit after tax jumped 35 per cent to $US1.42 billion, buoyed by higher prices.
Revenues gained 20 per cent despite a 10 per cent slide in output to 72.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Benchmark crude oil prices jumped 29 per cent last year to average $US80 a barrel, Woodside said. Higher prices, together with exchange rate effects, added about $US1.11 billion to net income.
Woodside declared a final dividend of US55Â¢ per share, fully franked, up from US49Â¢.
Some analysts complained of a  lack of visibility  on some key issues that are expected to drive Woodside's share price this year, including the expected further sell-down of Shell's stake in the company.
 Basically we don't know who the new CEO is going to be or what their strategy is going to be; we don't know what Shell is going to do with its 24 per cent stake; and we don't know what the nature of any third party gas agreement is going to be for Pluto-2,  said Adrian Wood at Macquarie Equities.
 Those were the areas we were looking for clarity on and we didn't get it. 
Woodside shares yesterday shed 0.4 per cent to $42.58.
Mr Voelte signalled that the Pluto-2 project would be almost certainly supplied by gas from Woodside's own intensive exploration campaign in the Carnarvon Basin.
But the end-2011 target for the go-ahead still hinges on the success of exploration wells yet to be drilled.
Talks with other companies about gas that could be processed through the Pluto-3 expansion â€“ understood to include Hess, ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton â€“ are still ongoing with no timetable for a conclusion.
Mr Voelte also warned of another possible slip in the start-up of the initial Pluto project, pointing to 20 days of lost construction time because of  horrific  weather.
The project, originally due to start up in late 2010 and cost $12 billion, is now due to begin in August.
Spending on the base Pluto project will account for $US1.63 billion of Woodside's planned $US3.45 billion of capital expenditure this year.
On the Browse LNG venture, Mr Voelte said the project was  tracking beautifully. But Woodside's partners (including BHP, Chevron and Shell) have yet to sanction the investment in initial engineering work, adding to speculation they still have doubts about the selection of James Price Point on the Kimberley coast as the onshore development site.
At the Sunrise project in the Timor Sea, Woodside said work on the proposed floating LNG concept, which is being resisted by the East Timor government, demonstrates  robust  economics for the project.
Woodside reiterated its forecast for 2011 full-year production of between 63 million and 66 million boe from its base business, plus between 5 million and 9 million boe from Pluto.

PAPUA New Guinea-focused Oil Search says it can create  significant value  for shareholders through an expansion of its liquefied natural gas portfolio, including possibly pressing the  go  button on a third LNG train in the country as early as next year.
 Oil Search managing director Peter Botten made the remarks as he reported that the company had made a $US185.6 million profit in the 2010 calendar year, up 39 per cent on 2009.
A 23 per cent rise in the average realised oil price boosted the result, despite 2010 oil and gas production falling 6 per cent to 7.7 million barrels of oil equivalent.
A final dividend of US2Â¢ a share was declared, in line with last year, taking total dividends for the year to US4Â¢.
Mr Botten said the strategic review done last year had found LNG expansion opportunities from existing fields near or associated with the $US15 billion ExxonMobil-led PNG LNG development.
 The review highlighted the fact that we could live with the returns from our existing asset base as long as we deliver oil in a sustainable way, as we have in the past, and continue to deliver PNG LNG and some LNG expansion programs,  he said.
 We have acquired through 2010 a number of licences in the offshore gulf area of PNG and also the adjacent onshore where we are [conducting] seismic work now and where we think there is future gas to deliver further growth. 
Asked by BusinessDay if the exploration and appraisal program to strengthen the resource base of PNG LNG could lead to a decision on a third LNG train by late 2012 or early 2013, Mr Botten said:  I think the programs that we are doing, if successful, may allow us that opportunity. The PNG government has highlighted that it expects continued expansion with train three and beyond.  There is 10 trillion cubic feet of gas in PNG not designated for commercial projects.

AGEE,The Age,2011,1,"WHEN he unveiled BHP Billiton's mega-profit last week, chief executive Marius Kloppers said the group was cool on acquisitions because asking prices were too high.
Yesterday BHP announced that it was paying Chesapeake Energy $US4.75 billion for a 75 per cent operating stake in 197,000 hectares of natural gas shale in the southern state of Arkansas and the pipeline system that connects it to America's east coast.
 That's not as inconsistent as it seems. Gas is the exception to the rule.
The price of takeovers in the resource industry is elevated because the price of key commodities such as coal, copper and iron ore are at, or close to, record highs. Oil is also on the move, and so are the prices being put on oil assets.
Oil is still short of its $US143.21 a barrel high, reached somewhat bizarrely in mid-2008, even as the financial crisis raced towards a climax that would crush global demand and economic growth. But at around $US93 a barrel it is well above its crisis low of US$55 a barrel, reached in February 2009.
Natural gas, on the other hand, was above $US14 a thousand cubic feet in 2005, above $US6 a thousand cubic feet early last year, and has deflated further since then to about $US3.88 a thousand cubic feet.
This is a reflection of rising actual and potential gas supplies with the development of technically difficult hydraulically fractured shale deposits, like the Fayetteville resource BHP is buying into, and the related breakdown in the price relationship between oil and gas. Measured in barrels of oil equivalent, the gas price currently equates to about $US24 a barrel of oil, an unprecedented discount.
BHP's acquisition logic is threefold. It believes the price of gas will rise in the long term, as the world's hunger for energy rises, as traditional large oil reservoirs are tapped out and as carbon pricing regimes push users towards cleaner energy sources.
It has also capitalised on the fact that the seller is under pressure to raise cash as corporate raider Carl Icahn circles, and paid a price that puts Fayetteville in the black. Chesapeake sold the other 25 per cent of Fayetteville to BP in 2008 for $US1.9 billion: BHP's entry price is about $US1.4 billion per 25 per cent slab.
The US group is selling assets after taking on too much debt to acquire a portfolio of shale properties, and the task took on urgency in December when Icahn declared a 5.8 per cent shareholding â€” Chesapeake had earlier offered BHP farm-in deals and had been told to ring if it had something larger on its mind, and talks with BHP about Fayetteville began soon after Icahn's emergence.
Finally, BHP believes it can increase the profits it extracts from Fayetteville by increasing the deposit's productive acreage â€” the resource is 80 per cent unproved, and has the potential to boost the group's net oil and gas reserve and resource base by 45 per cent.
In that sense, BHP is doing what it did in the mid-1980s, when it bought the rich Bowen Basin coal deposits in Queensland from Utah of the US when the coal price was weak. BHP was buying straw hats in winter, then chairman of BHP James McNeill said.
Fayetteville is a much smaller bite, and BHP will fund the deal from cash generation. But over time the new asset should also deliver, initially as BHP throws more money â€” more wells, in effect â€” at the project to accelerate the expansion of reserves and production.
That said, there are two wild cards, and the first is the price of gas itself. It is low by historical standards and has a good chance of increasing as demand for clean energy rises.
But gas is cheap for a reason, and that reason is the rapidly rising exploitation of shale gas reserves using hydraulic fracturing technology.
The supply-side bulge is growing as more shale deposits are located and developed. It ensures that gas-price movements in the medium term are modest, and raises some risk that they will weaken. Certainly BHP will not be banking on a return to the $10-plus peaks of the past decade: they were achieved before shale emerged as a major new source of gas.
The second risk is environmental.
Fayetteville and others like it are are becoming an increasingly important source of new energy as older, more accessible fields dry up, and are expected to account for more than 20 per cent of America's gas supply by 2020.
But they require a much more complicated extraction process than conventional oil and gas fields, involving lengthy horizontal drilling, followed by the hydraulic fracturing of the rock to unlock the gas.
It is a controversial process, one subject to persistent claims that it results in contamination of drinking water as the rock fractures.
America's Environmental Protection Agency is studying the technique to better understand, in its words,  the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water resources .
The EPA studied the same thing in 2004 and concluded that that there was no link between hydraulic fracturing and water quality. But it will look harder this time â€” because the process is more widespread, and because the US Congress has told it that it must.
The EPA study sits at the official end of the environmental threat to BHP's expansion into shale. The risk of community-based legal action against shale developments sits at the other.
BHP oil boss Mike Yeager did not mention either yesterday, but he probably had them in mind when he said that the Fayetteville structure was located in a  pro-business  state, and in an  extremely rural  location.
The Maiden family owns BHP shares.

She says test drilling for coal seam gas is already underway near Bunbury, Busselton, Dongara and at the Kimberley's Canning Basin.
Ms Xamon is calling for the State Government to impose a moratorium on its exploration in WA.
 Certainly it is my hope that as people become more aware of the negative impacts that this industry can have on our groundwater supplies, that people will be far more likely to speak up about it and speak out about their concerns,  she said.
She says the industry is too dangerous and should be kept out of WA.
 I think it has the very real potential to negatively impact on our groundwater supplies, such that they will simply be too toxic to be able to be used for agricultural purposes but also for residents who live in those areas,  she said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"AUSTRALIA Pacific LNG will accelerate its search for an Asian investor to take up to 15 per cent of its coal-seam gas project in Queensland after it received federal government approval for the proposal yesterday.
Santos and British-based Queensland Gas already have federal and state approvals as well as a final investment decision for their $15 billion projects, but APLNG, a joint venture of Australian company Origin and US giant Conoco, still needs a foundation customer for its $35bn project.
 Chinese companies PetroChina and Sinopec, Thailand's PTT and India's Petronet are all possibilities to take large amounts of liquid natural gas processed through what would be the largest of the LNG refineries at Curtis Island, just north of Gladstone Harbour in central Queensland.
The APLNG project is proposing a plant capable of producing 9 million tonnes a year, with two trains, which would make it the biggest LNG deal in Australia and one of the biggest in the world.
Origin has the largest coal-seam gas reserves of all the projects so far, but the lack of a foundation customer has left much of the market sceptical about whether the venture will proceed, given that two projects have already started letting contracts for the construction of plant and other infrastructure.
Both Queensland Gas and Santos were able to secure large foundation orders well before they received their government approvals, which meant the time taken to move from getting the approvals to a final investment decision was fairly short.
The other remaining large LNG project involves Arrow Energy and Shell, and they are not likely to start seeking government approvals until late this year at the earliest, but it is less market-sensitive because the projected product would largely be used by the developers themselves.
The conditions set by the federal government include specific actions to address water pressure in the Great Artesian Basin -- much of the gas comes from the Surat Basin in Western Queensland, which sits atop the Great Artesian Basin -- as well as conditions to protect threatened animals and ecosystems in the sensitive areas near the Great

Barrier Reef close to Curtis Island.
But while APLNG now faces the issue of getting a large investor, the industry as a whole has political problems. Media reports say farmers in Queensland are concerned with the rapid growth of the industry and the possible effect on farming.
Queensland farmers were incensed that the federal government approval came just a day after an ABC Four Corners program, which showed problems with water levels in artesian basins and raised concerns about the process of ``fracking'', which involves injecting chemicals into the ground to help extract gas from coal seams.
AgForce president Brent Finlay said ``their timing could have been better''.
The government was proceeding with an industry without full knowledge of its effects on other industries such as farming, Mr Finlay said. ``We don't think they should be allowing this industry to develop until we fully understand what the effect will be on the land, including what's under the land.''
While mainstream political parties have broadly backed the development of the industry, subject to environmental safeguards, the Greens have formed an alliance with farmers to strongly oppose the industry.
Australian Greens deputy leader Christine Milne said it was ``madness to build a new fossil fuel industry at the end of the fossil fuel age''.

 A group of landholders, residents, farmers and grape growers in the Pokolbin and Broke areas have united to fight plans to sink gas wells on their land.
 This is a disaster sitting right on our door step,  Mr Brown said.
 Farmers, landowners and our natural environment should not have to pay for the as yet unknown extent of damage and pollution this industry is already causing, just so that mining corporations can turn a profit. 
Coal seam gas is the gas extracted from underground coal.
It is extracted by the process of  fraccing , which involves blasting a mix of water, sand and chemicals to crack the coal seam and allow the gas to escape.
Environmental risks include surface and groundwater pollution, land use impacts from surface infrastructure and greenhouse pollution from leached methane.
Mr Brown said the Greens called for a moratorium on coal seam gas exploration until the science of fraccing and its polluting effects were better understood, and until there were proper environmental protection and regulatory procedures in place.
 Maitland has a strong history in agriculture, so many farmers in this area would have great sympathy for other landowners and would be concerned at the destruction of their land and damage to health,  he said.

Oil Search expects to sanction a third processing line at its Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project by the end of 2013 in a bid to capitalise on one of the most profitable gas development opportunities in Asia.
 The Sydney-based company, which recently completed a strategic review of its business, will focus its efforts on the expansion of the $US15 billion ExxonMobil-led development along with more drilling in other parts of the country.
Chief executive Peter Botten told The Australian Financial Review the company was likely to agree a deal with Exxon for the next phase of PNG LNG following drilling at the Hides gas field in the Highlands region
 The end of 2013 is a likelihood for the expansion, but first of all we need to get further down the line with our drilling [at Hides] later this year and into 2012,  Mr Botten said.
Oil Search and Exxon gave final approval for the initial 6.6 million barrels a day PNG LNG facility in December 2009 with exports to customers in Japan, China and Taiwan scheduled to start by early 2014.
Deutsche Bank has estimated the project represents 91 per cent of Oil Search's net asset value while Wall Street research firm Sanford C Bernstein said adding a third LNG Â­production unit would be worth $2 a share to the energy company.
Higher crude oil prices and a one-off restatement of deferred tax helped Oil Search deliver a 39 per cent jump in full-year net profit yesterday to $US185.6 million despite a drop in Â­production volumes.
The company had previously flagged its 2011 full-year production was expected to be in the range of 6.2 million to 6.7 million barrels of oil equivalent compared with 7.66 million barrels in 2010.
The Sydney-based company said the drop was the result of underlying field decline and planned maintenance of facilities during the year.
Mr Botten said he was comfortable with inflated labour and contractor costs on the PNG project.
 We're not in the same pool of labour as the Australian projects â€“ we have the whole world to draw our labour force from,  he said.
Oil Search expects to slowly divest parts of its Middle East business in countries including Yemen and Tunisia as part of the company's sharpened focus on investment and exploration in PNG.
 We reviewed the assets as part of the strategic review and it is likely that a number of those will be sold off through the next 12 months or so,  said Mr Botten.  We believe there is value there, but against our overall business in PNG, they don't have that materiality, so we'll concentrate on our own backyard. 
Mr Botten added it may retain its stake in Kurdistan province in Iraq.

The ruling mirrors the clearances given by Mr Burke in October for BG Group's $US15 billion-plus Qld Curtis venture and Santos's $US16 billion GLNG project, both now in the early stages of construction.
 Origin and Conoco still need to firm up contracts with LNG customers before making a final decision on whether to build the project. The first phase involves two 4.5 million tonnes-a-year LNG production units which use coal seam gas fields from the Bowen and Surat basins.
The partners have already missed their target of end-2010 to give the green light for the investment, which some now expect only later this year.
APLNG project director Page Maxson yesterday welcomed the environmental clearance. An Origin spokesperson declined to provide an update on the schedule in advance of tomorrow's interim profit report.
Market speculation has focused on China's Sinopec as a leading candidate to buy LNG from the project.
Queensland's coal seam gas industry is struggling against a rising tide of concern among farmers that it could interfere with the water table in the Great Artesian Basin.
Adding to the fears, some of the ventures, including APLNG, last year reported trace levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as BTEX in exploration wells. The news sparked calls from environmental groups for a moratorium on the industry.
Mr Burke said he had set strict conditions to ensure water resources are properly managed.
 The companies must submit for my approval water management and monitoring plans detailing how impacts on aquifers, groundwater and surface water will be minimised, including through strict limits to maintain aquifer pressures,  he said.
Water pressure must be kept above set thresholds and companies must have plans ready to re-establish pressure should those limits be exceeded.
The conditions are consistent with those imposed on the BG and Santos projects and an Origin spokeswoman said they contained nothing the venture had not anticipated.
To offset unavoidable impacts on Curtis Island, the companies must secure an area five times the size of their project sites to be added to the National Park estate.
Senator Rachel Siewert, the Australian Greens Water spokesperson, said the conditions did not guarantee safety.
 Coal seam gas development represents a significant threat to our water systems and there are many critical unanswered questions about its broader impacts,  she said.  A lack of knowledge makes this a risky business, even before safety concerns are raised. 
Australia's oil industry association described the ruling as  a win for good process over fear campaigns .

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CLIMATE PERTH, Feb 24 AAP - Using natural gas to generate power and fuel buses is a better way to reduce carbon emissions than falsely assuming a carbon tax will cut energy use, West Australian Premier Colin Barnett says.
Responding to Prime Minister Julia Gillard's announcement on Thursday that Australia will put a price on carbon emissions from mid next year, Mr Barnett said he preferred direct measures to reduce emissions.
  For example, we would do a lot in this country if we just used more of our own natural gas for power generation, and less coal. That's a sensible thing to do.
 Similarly, we can use more natural gas in public transport, the bus fleet and so on,  Mr Barnett told reporters in Perth.
He said a carbon tax would mean a significant rise in electricity and fuel prices for every Australian.
 The assumption behind a carbon price is that if you raise the price, say of electricity, or you raise the price of fuel, people will use less of it.
 There have been decades of economic studies to show that that's not the case,  Mr Barnett said.
Raising the price of electricity or the price of fuel did not reduce power consumption or stop people driving their cars, he said.
The premier said the carbon tax would be a tax on consumers and may have very limited effect in reducing emissions.
 So I would say to Julia Gillard, I recognise and I support measures to deal with carbon emissions, but let's do the sensible things.
 Let's look at ways of reducing our emissions in a direct-action method, rather than hoping a tax on consumers is somehow going to affect their behaviour, because it won't. 
Mr Barnett said if the carbon price was set too high it would dampen the resource processing industry.
 Our ambition to get more mineral processing will be frustrated because by definition, mineral processing is energy intensive. 
The scheme announced by Ms Gillard will start with a fixed price on carbon emissions on July 1, 2012, followed by a scheme with a flexible price and an emissions target starting as early as 2015.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The Environmental Defender's Office is pushing to have public meetings held on the north coast to outline the New South Wales government's coal and gas strategy.
The Department of Planning is holding community forums this week in the Illawarra and Hunter regions to explain its scoping paper on the industry.
 But a spokesman for the Planning minister has confirmed there will be no such meetings for the north coast.
Mark Byrne from the EDO says there are significant gas deposits on the north coast and residents want to be informed.
 The companies are still discovering gas and it's very hard for someone in government to say that there is too small and there isn't a need, there is a lot of evidence now that people up here are concerned about what's happening so it would be good for the government to respond,  Mr Byrne said.
He believes the government is fixed on coal mining and is ignoring the growing industry of gas mining.
 We are getting significant amounts of gas found in this area on the north coast and I actually wrote to the Department of Planning a couple of days ago suggesting they hold a public meeting here, I haven't heard back yet,  he said.
Over 160 people attended the EDO's public seminar on gas mining in Lismore two weeks ago.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2011,1,"Origin Energy's $35 billion Australia Pacific LNG joint venture received approval this week.
APLNG, a joint venture between Origin Energy and American company ConocoPhillips, was officially approved for coal seam and liquefied natural gas by the Federal Government on Tuesday.
 Australia Pacific LNG project director Page Maxson welcomed the decision and committed APLNG to managing any potential environmental impacts.
â€œApproval is conditional on a large number of environmental strategies and ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements being put in place. The conditions outlined in today's approval complement those contained in the Queensland Coordinator-General's report and reinforce the commitments made in our EIS,â€? he said.
â€œAustralia Pacific LNG will pursue high environmental, community consultation and development standards not only during the construction period but also throughout the ongoing operational life of this exciting project.â€?
Federal minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities Tony Burke said environmental factors were the key point in his decision to approve the project.
â€œWhile I have considered the significant economic benefits of this project, my focus has been on protecting environmental matters of national significance through strict conditions that will minimise any potential environmental impacts,â€? he said.
â€œIn relation to the Great Artesian Basin, I have taken a precautionary approach by requiring 'early warning' thresholds and detailed ongoing monitoring.
â€œWater pressure must be maintained above conservative thresholds that will be set on the advice of experts. Should these be exceeded, the companies must have plans ready to re-establish pressure, through re-injection or other means,â€? Mr Burke said.
The project was granted State Government approval last November.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"WHEN significant coal seam gas finds were made in our region this paper was the first to champion the industry's cause.
I remember coming up with a headline that aped part of a Rolling Stones song â€œIt's a gas, gas, gasâ€?.
 With the potential to build power stations in the region and export gas to several countries overseas, it had the makings of being a big employer and even bigger money spinner.
But it seems the devil may be in the detail for this industry, which has been beset by problems both here, interstate and overseas.
As yet, I haven't seen Gasland, only news footage taken from the US film of ground water being set alight.
And I only caught about half of Monday night's Four Corners program which was mainly focused on the problems some farmers in Queensland have experienced with leaking gas wells.
Now we have it confirmed that wells in our region are seeping methane gas into the air.
Groups like the NSW Farmers' Association and Lismore City Council have called for a moratorium on new coal seam gas projects.
The Environmental Defenders Office also wants the government regulator to step in and investigate reports of leaking wells.
It is time for the industry to pause, take stock of the situation and respond positively, because if mining companies get it right, this could really be a goer.
Get it wrong and the consequences are much more dire.
"
FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"A RURAL property agent at the centre of the rapidly expanding coal seam gas industry in Queensland has warned that properties affected by gas mining are becoming increasingly harder to sell.
Vince O'Brien has been a rural property agent with Elders at Roma for more than 35 years, and in the past five years has had a front-row seat to the explosive growth that has occurred in the CSG well and pipeline infrastructure across the region.
 The burgeoning industry has brought thousands of jobs and millions of dollars' worth of investment to regional Queensland, but with those gains have come hidden and, some say substantial, costs.
Among them is Mr O'Brien, who says he has been astounded at the way in which many rural landowners have  rolled over  and accepted CSG wells on their properties without paying sufficient heed to the potential damage that CSG mining can cause to their water, land and long-term property values.
Before CSG companies can drill, they must first negotiate arrangements with property owners to compensate for mining impacts.
Agreements often involve initial payments followed by ongoing annual payments for each well on a property.
While the details of these payments are often hidden in confidentiality agreements, figures of $3000-$6000/well/ year are understood to be representative of the current market. Such compensation packages can amount to substantial and welcome cash flows for producers, particularly in dry years when farming or grazing incomes are restrained.
However, Mr O'Brien said signs were mounting that CSG mining could cause greater losses to long-term property values than affected producers realised when negotiating access agreements.
He believes compensation packages as a minimum should be set at 20 percent of the market value of the property, based on the levels of buyer resistance that were evident for properties with CSG infrastructure.
 The bottom line is you can't sell them,  he said.  No-one wants to buy these places because they have mining activity on them | they say show me something else.
 People say to me before they even want to inspect: is there any mining activity? If there is, I'm not coming | I don't want to be involved. They can't stand it. 
Mr O'Brien recently provided a statement as an expert witness in a court case in which a large rural company sought compensation for value to property lost as a result of CSG mining.
In his statement he observed:  I know as a fact there is a strong buyer resistance (I'd call it 100 percent resistance) to rural properties which are affected by CSG activities. 
Indicative of the trend was the increasingly common sight of property advertising material declaring that a property had no gas or mining activity  because this was such a strong selling point , Mr O'Brien said.
 From time to time I am asked by clients wanting to sell properties affected by CSG activities for advice.
 What I say to them is that they should not waste their money on any form of advertising if their properties are affected by gas or mining activities.
 I also tell them that because of the concerns prospective purchasers have about these types of activities, the values of their properties have definitely softened considerably. 
He conceded that it was difficult to produce evidence of a link between CSG mining and declining rural property values because of the limited number of property sales that had occurred in the district in recent years.
The problem was compounded because the few isolated sales of properties with existing or proposed gas infrastructure that had occurred had largely been sold directly to CSG companies.
Mr O'Brien also questioned the extent to which regional economies benefitted from the CSG mining boom.
This was because most CSG workers operated on a fly in, fly out basis and spent their earnings away from the areas in which they were earned. Money was being taken out and not being put back.
While businesses such as motels in Roma were booming, others were struggling. A major car dealership in town recently closed its doors, followed soon after by the Maranoa Club, a long-running licensed social club.
Locals were having to pay mining company prices, such as rates of $120/hour for tradesmen.
 A lot of businesses around town would not be going well. 
"
FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"THE Queensland coal seam gas industry is happy for its social and environmental performance to face media scrutiny.
It is fair enough when the media pulls the industry up where performance could and should be improved. But in the case of Monday's ABC TV's Four Corners episode, which did little more than (very selectively) re-package some well-known issues and misrepresent how important aspects of our practices are regulated, it is neither fair enough nor good enough.
 Contrary to the ABC's Four Corners 'The Gas Rush' selective presentation, the coal seam gas industry does respect landholders and their rights, does care about the environment, is responsible in its use of chemicals and goes about its business in a professional manner.
There may well be personality clashes, difficult land access negotiations and impacts on lifestyle and visual amenity but this industry objects strongly to Four Corners' presentation of it as irresponsible and riding roughshod.
This industry wants to produce gas, to co-exist with landholders and to be as much a part of their local community as the next person.
Over the past 10 years the coal seam gas industry in Queensland has grown | it now supplies 90 percent of Queensland's domestic gas market; it contributes substantially to local economies; some 1600 gas wells and 1390 land access agreements are in place; it operates under a tight regulatory regime; is transparent about its operations and processes; and, brings much needed energy to an increasingly energy hungry word and does so with a much lower greenhouse gas impact than coal.
And you don't get to be any of that if you behave as the producers of Four Corners would have you believe. The community expects landholders to correctly use chemicals and there is an equal obligation on the CSG industry; while Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are freely and publicly available, it was unclear from the TV show, what the consequences were of an out of date MSDS. A quick google of the subject chemical, THPS shows a CAS number and in turn AICS listing so the chemical is registered with NICNAS (assessment by NICNAS is a separate matter). Chemicals to be used in fraccing fluids need to be consistent with regulations set and approved by the Australian regulatory body, the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) and the CSG industry abides by this.
With regards to the leaking gas wells, it is noteworthy that after months of research, the only wells Four Corners had to report on were the instances already publicly known. There are over 1600 gas wells built for the purpose of capturing gas | not losing it | so, without excusing the two problem wells, leaking gas wells are very much the exception across the industry.
QGC has provided detailed written responses (both AGL and QGC | available on the Four Corners website) regarding the hydraulic fracturing of the well where there was pre-existing connectivity between the Springbok aquifer and the Walloon Coal Measures | rightly, this is a matter for the regulator to investigate.
In order to produce gas the CSG industry needs to access the land surface and to do so the CSG company must negotiate with the landholder. CSG companies want good, long-term relationships with landholders and there is no place for 'might is right' or ' sign up or see you in court' stuff. The 'talk early, talk often and respect landholders' approach is the successful approach. There are some 1390 landholder access agreements in place with only one in the Land Court (at the landholder's behest) so the process, while not to everyone's liking, is working.
Notwithstanding that the information trail was a bit light-on at times, including pre-existing landholder/company background issues, there is in short, no other acceptable industry position than the gas wells must be fixed, landholders afforded due respect and compensation, and the resolution of any lingering aspects of chemical use. It is understandable that landholders seek reassurance that co-existence with CSG production won't be at the expense of their health, their bore water or aquifer/alluvium integrity.
They also need to reflect upon their own practices | genetically modified plants, stock domestic and irrigation bores and dams, extensive use of pesticides and animal health products, modifying the landscape through cultivation, burning native habitat, cropping, cloven-hoofed animals and for good measure occasionally dispatching the national emblem | all of which are okay because landholders are responsible food and fibre producers.
This isn't an us and them thing, but production of energy, food or fibre inevitably impacts on lifestyle and the environment.
"
FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"SIMMERING tensions between landholders, mining companies and the State Government have reignited after ABC Television's Four Corners program show-ed shocking images of coal seam gas (CSG) mining.
The heat of the CSG debate has barely cooled within the pages of this newspaper in the past three years, but the intense rage gripping southern Queensland landholders has now reached fever pitch, escalating within 24 hours of the current affairs program going to air on Monday.
 Among the harrowing scenes striking fear into rural and regional landholders across the state were:
l Faulty gas wells polluting bores and pumping potentially lethal toxins into underground aquifers.
l Worrying assessments by environmental scientists that damage to the Great Artesian Basin will not be repaired for another 1000 years.
l Heavy-handed tactics by mining companies to access private land.
l The inability of Mines Minister Steph-en Robertson to answer direct questions.
As Queensland Country Life went to press these were the developments dominating the fallout:
l Landholders aligned to the Coal4 Breakfast group are mobilising in their hundreds to protest at a Community Cabinet meeting in Toowoomba on March 13 in what could be the district's biggest rally yet against CSG mining.
l Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association (APPEA) chief executive Belinda Robinson goes on the attack, calling anti-CSG campaigners a  noisy and misleading minority  and claiming Australia's CSG industry is the most carefully scrutinised and heavily regulated in the country.
l AgForce president Brent Finlay slams Premier Anna Bligh for her recent Cabinet reshuffle that has seen government responsibility for the issue withdrawn from the seasoned Stephen Robertson and transferred to two new ministers who must now be briefed on the run.
l Australian Lot Feeders Association president Jim Cudmore reveals that feedlots have experienced significant reductions in groundwater levels since the CSG industry began operating in their areas, while others have bores leaking gas due to CSG development despite Queensland Government guarantees that such bores would be fixed.
l Basin Sustainability Alliance chairman Ian Hayllor fears a raft of environmental impact statements provided to the State Government may have been shelved, saying their repeated warnings verified by independent analysis have not been paid due attention by the government or the mining companies at the centre of the storm.
l The overwhelming condemnation of CSG mining operations and the State Government's role in drafting legislation that has allowed a handful of energy companies to ride roughshod over prime agricultural land is now in the mainstream public spotlight.
It has also left the Government scrambling to defend its environmental and economic credentials | both taking a hammering | as it walks a tightrope to appease anxious landholders, agitated miners and a fragile alliance with shadowy green groups.
But there's also trouble looming for the Opposition, with veteran hard-man Jeff Seeney reaffirming his position that CSG and liquid natural gas mining can coexist with farming, isolating him fur-ther colleagues and the LNP's rural con-stituency that Labor will be key to ex- ploit in the state election countdown.
Before shifting portfolios last week, Mr Robertson announced the establishment of the LNG Enforcement Unit, a  multi-disciplinary unit made up of specialists tasked with monitoring the emerging CSG-LNG industry .
 This team is equipped with the power and the resources to make sure this industry adheres to its legislative obligations to the Queensland community,  Mr Robertson said.
 The unit will also investigate formal complaints from landholders and lead prosecutions where investigations pro-vide evidence of wrongdoing. 
Mr Seeney said he believes the legislation and its enforcement will provide the proper safeguards to ensure landholders are protected.
 Problems developed with CSG min-ing because the Government was slow to act, but those regulations and their enforcement have improved markedly over the past 12 months,  he said.
 I wouldn't pretend that it's perfect, but it is a step in the right direction. 
However, ALFA's Jim Cudmore said the Bligh Government's legislation was flawed, and he had little faith in the new unit's ability to tackle any alleged min-ing company breaches.
 The Water and Other Legislation Bill does not address water quality con-tamination by CSG operators, and we remain unconvinced that other legislation addresses this issue without land-owners seeking civil action,  he said.
 The proposed burden of proof arrangements have already been found to be wanting, with it being almost impossible for landowners to establish that CSG operations were the cause of groundwater issues. Amazingly, despite the CSG industry being in operation for over a decade, the Queensland Govern-ment has yet to determine baseline guidelines for groundwater from which CSG impacts could be assessed.
 Concerns regarding subsidence, management of salt from treated CSG water and negative impacts upon land values due to CSG operations still remain.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"CSG juggernaut rolls on
ANOTHER big push by the coal seam gas industry in Queensland has been given the green light by the Common-wealth this week.
 On Tuesday, Australia Pacific LNG Pty Limited received federal environmental approval for its $35 billion coal seam gas (CSG) to liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.
Australia Pacific LNG is a 50:50 incorporated joint venture between Origin and ConocoPhillips.
The project involves the development of Australia Pacific LNG's CSG resources in the Surat and Bowen basins; building a 450km transmission pipeline; and construction of a multi-train LNG facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone.
The approval of the project follows approval by the Queensland Coordinator-General in November 2010, which imposed a set of environmental and social conditions on the project before it can proceed.
Treasurer and Minister for State Development Andrew Fraser said the conditions the Commonwealth imposed on the project largely mirror those of the state.
 The next step includes applications for specific environmental authorities and various other planning and development approvals at state and local government level,  Mr Fraser said.
Tuesday's approval now means three CSG-LNG project proposals in Queensland worth a combined $66 billion have now cleared State and Commonwealth approval processes, and include the $16b Gladstone LNG project backed by Santos, PETRONAS, Total and KOGAS; and the $15b Queensland Curtis LNG project (BG Group and Queensland Gas Company).

AGEE,The Age,2011,1,"AT A GLANCE
Half-year 	 	2010-11 	2009-10

Statutory net profit 	($136m) 	$371m
Earnings per share 	(15.4Â¢) 	 42.3Â¢
Dividend 	 	25Â¢ 	 25Â¢

BIG question marks hang over Origin Energy's $35 billion Queensland liquefied natural gas project after the company allowed joint-venture partner ConocoPhillips to defer a $1 billion payment until the project produces an agreed return on investment.
 The revelation came as Origin reported a $136 million first-half net loss, compared with a $371 million profit at the same time the year before, after being forced to write down its geothermal investment.
Origin has also revised its full-year profit forecast due to a planned capital raising to fund its $3.25 billion purchase of New South Wales power assets.
Origin shares slumped 3.5 per cent as the market feared ConocoPhillips might be going cold on the LNG project.
But Origin managing director Grant King said the potential deferral was  to help progress a final investment decision in the near term , meaning that an LNG buyer could be imminent given that it is what the company is awaiting before it decides.
Mr King was unable to explain what might trigger the deferral.  Evidence is that in our mind it would only trigger if it was of net benefit to Origin's interest in APLNG [the Australia Pacific LNG project],  he said.
Goldman Sachs analysts said the main negative with the result was the uncertainty about the APLNG project.
 Conoco was due to pay $500 million for the first two trains for hitting certain milestones,  it told clients.
 From FID [final investment decision] to when they make an economic return equals a very long time. 
When one-off items are taken out of Origin's result, including a $154 million write-down on the Innamincka geothermal joint venture with Geodynamics and $164 million in stamp duty from the NSW power purchase, it posted an underlying profit of $304 million for the first half, down from $355 million in the previous corresponding period.
Mr King said he now expected full-year underlying profit growth of between 10 and 15 per cent, down from previous guidance of 15 per cent.
 That range is entirely due to the fact that at some point during that period there will be an equity raising,  he said.
The raising will not be greater than the $3.25 billion Origin paid for the NSW energy assets.
Mr King said he believed geothermal power, which harnesses heat from Earth's core, was still worth pursuing despite the spectacular failure of the Innamincka  deeps  project, in which Origin holds a 30 per cent stake.
The project, in South Australia's Cooper Basin, has been awarded millions of dollars in drilling grants from the federal government plus $90 million under the renewable energy demonstration program, which is to be unlocked once the company passes proof-of-concept stage.
Mr King said the joint venture's attention would turn to the  shallows , where it would try to generate power from temperatures between 120 and 140 degrees.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2011,1,"AgForce fires up with information sessions
AgForce Projects Landholder Coal Seam Gas (CSG) Information Sessions kick off in the Surat Basin soon, with growers and graziers describing them as crucial for safeguarding agricultural industries.
 Dulacca grazier Mrs Hughes believes she is typical of many producers since gas interests were declared over two of her family's properties â€œDulacca Downsâ€? and â€œHeatherleaâ€?.
Her plans to build a new home have been put on hold indefinitely.
â€œI've been waiting for these information sessions; now we can get on and deal with Coal Seam Gas activities in the best way for us,â€? Mrs Hughes said.
â€œWe need to know how best to negotiate with gas companies and what are the issues to be addressed to ensure our rights are protected.
â€œThe CSG industry will have a massive impact on rural communities and our businesses into the future and as such the more information and knowledge we can gather, the better equipped we will be to negotiate equitable financial and business outcomes and safeguard our industry.â€?
The free sessions to be held in Dalby, Chinchilla and Dulacca are the first of 30 such sessions being held in the Surat Basin.
AgForce Projects manager Sue Dillon said AgForce has consistently raised landholders' concerns over CSG activities with government and the farm lobby group will continue to call for a moratorium on activities until further planning and research into its collective impact on the environment are conducted.
In the meantime, Ms Dillon's objective is to ensure landholders are prepared and know their rights and responsibilities.
â€œInformation sessions will cover what to expect during the access, exploration and production phases of CSG activities, as well as how landholders can ensure fair conduct and compensation agreements are made with CSG companies,â€? Ms Dillon said.
â€œWe've arranged for Toowoomba-based Legal Aid solicitor Glen Martin to attend the Dulacca and Chinchilla sessions, providing landholders with a great opportunity to receive legal assistance and advice in person.
â€œHow to keep quality environmental baseline records will also be covered.â€?
The Dalby information session will be held on March 31 from 9am-12.30pm.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"GREENS MP Cate Faehrmann has renewed calls for a moratorium on coal seam gas drilling after The Northern Star revealed at least two sites on the Northern Rivers were leaking.
The Star yesterday revealed there were more than 50 drill sites in place or approved across the region.
 It revealed two supposedly sealed drill sites near Bentley were leaking methane gas through the soil.
Metgasco, which is responsible for the sites, insists the leaking gas is not entering underground water reservoirs around the drill sites.
Ms Faehrmann, the NSW Greens' mining spokeswoman, said the leaks showed the â€˜urgent need' for a moratorium on coal seam drilling.
â€œRecently-released Coalition and Labor policies will fail to protect water supplies, farmlands and communities from the gas rush that is happening in NSW right now,â€? Ms Faehrmann said.
Meanwhile, the Shut the Gate coalition, which opposes coal seam gas drilling, is showing screenings of the US documentary, Gasland, at Ballina Fair cinema on February 28, at 7pm, and at Byron Bay's Dendy cinema on March 1, at 6.45pm.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"ORIGIN Energy insisted yesterday that its Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas plant was still on track to get final investment approval in the not too distant future.
But in a cryptic note to its announcement of its half-year result, the group indicated two payments of $500 million each - which were due from its joint venture partner ConocoPhillips when final investment decisions were made on AP LNG's first and second planned processing plants or ``trains'' - might be deferred.
 Origin chief executive Grant King declined to enlarge on exactly what would trigger such a deferral - which would result in the payments being delayed until Conoco had achieved ``an agreed (but unspecified) economic return on (its) total investment in AP LNG''.
Deferral would prima facie mean Origin - which also yesterday wrote off its investment in Brisbane-based hot rock stock Geodynamics and its Cooper Basin drilling program - would have to find an extra $1 billion in funding for AP LNG.
That led to some questions that Conoco might be going cool on the project, which with two trains would cost about $US16 billion and which is yet to sign up any customers.
Mr King insisted, however, ``that both AP LNG partners were keen to proceed''.
When pushed on what circumstances would trigger a deferral of the two $500 million payments, Mr King declined to elaborate, saying the terms were commercially sensitive to Origin and Conoco ``and (also) externally''.
``Any deferral would provide a net benefit to Origin,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Origin's shares came under pressure after it reported a first-half loss of $136 million - because of a $154 million write-down on its Geodynamics investment.
The stock shed 57c to $15.91. Origin now expects full year underlying profit growth of 10 to 15 per cent, down from earlier guidance of a 15 per cent boost.
It declared a fully franked 25 a share interim dividend, the same as in the previous first half.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"Gassed to go
QUEENSLAND Resources Council chief Michael Roche was at lunch yesterday with the Queensland Petroleum Exploration Association, making the QRC's case that it was a ``broad church'' with as much to do for the gas industry, particularly the coal-seam gas sector, as it did for the likes of big coal and the state's metal miners.
 But Roche, in the wake of this week's ABC Four Corners damnation of the CSG industry, also told the Irish Club lunch that the industry needed to work hard on the science of how CSG production, which requires the pumping of lots of water from coal seams, might affect the Great Artesian Basin - the life's blood of much of rural Australia.
There was a light moment, however, when Roche was asked to draw the raffle - and drew his own ticket.
Your diarist, lurking way down the back of the room, couldn't quite see whether he handed the prize back and called for a redraw.
Bondage
FRESH off the plane from London, former QGC boss and present CEO of Melbourne-based Nexus EnergyRichard Cottee was in fine form as he talked up the future of coal-seam gas at the Brisbane Mining Club's first lunch for 2010 yesterday.
Listening intently at the Tattersall's Club function was chairman of newly listed uranium explorer Alligator Energy, Denis Gately, Sedgman's Craig Porter, QGC's Rob Millhouse and Jim Petrich, AM.
Cottee illuminated all with an unusual message involving canaries and bondage (the molecular variety, mind you).
He also hosed down any speculation he might make a return to the Sunshine State any time soon, saying he only recently had a lobotomy so as to fit in better down south.
$500m smile
WHILE Keith De Lacy wasn't at this week's Macarthur Coal results briefing, City Beat is sure he was smiling - as was his chief executive Nicole Hollows.
Macarthur's present financial state, with about $500 million in the bank, is pretty impressive.
Still, you never know when you might find an opportunity and Macarthur, with plenty of development ahead of it - on its Middlemount mine and a fourth operation, likely to be Codrilla or Willunga.
But Macarthur has plenty more coal than that out there in the boondocks, and it has been assessing a bundle of other deposits, as to their potential - and not just their potential for development by Macarthur.
Indeed, once its assessments are complete, Macarthur could be seeking some more cash - by putting a deposit or two on the market, in an effort to take advantage of the world's lucrative love affair with coal.
Club straitjacket
WHEN talk turns to Brisbane's exclusive business clubs, The Queensland Club, established 1860, rarely ranks a mention.
Like Tatts, women are not allowed except by invitation on rare occasions, guests being welcomed by an alarmingly large stuffed crocodile when they enter the club on the corner of Alice and George streets.
A contact recently had the privilege of dining at the QC and wandered downtown in sweltering heat, his jacket and tie off.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Chesapeake Energy, which sold its Fayetteville shale gas assets to BHP Billiton for $US4.75 billion this week, expects North American gas will be liquefied and exported to Europe and Asia at high prices by 2015.
 We believe LNG exports from the US will be a very bullish event and should begin to affect the back of the natural gas curve once ground breaks on several of these projects by year-end 2012,  Chesapeake chief executive Aubrey McClendon told US analysts yesterday.
  This development will be notably aided by a widening of the Panama Canal in the next few years to accommodate large LNG vessels. 
BHP has highlighted its belief that US gas breaks even at $US4 per million cubic feet (Mmcf), compared with a $US8 per Mmcf price needed for Australian LNG projects. If the US gas price rises substantially from its current cyclical low of $US3.83 Mmcf through natural demand or LNG exports, BHP could earn higher margins through onshore US gas than through investments in Western Australia.
The head of global investment banking at BHP's deal advisers Scotia Capital, Adam Waterous, said the Australian company's first purchase in the US shale gas market was unlikely to be its last.
 You don't just want to stop with a single asset,  he told Canada's Globe and Mail.  I'm sure they will continue to be open to further acquisition opportunities because shale gas fits with the strategy of large, low-cost expandable assets. 
Mr McClendon said Chesapeake was  very sad  to sell the Fayetteville assets, but noted it would help his company repay debt to reach its goal of an investment grade credit rating.
 BHP have got a great asset, they've got a great price for it and we were able to sell a great asset at a great price for us,  he said.  That's one of the situations where I think both companies can walk away the better for. 
Mr Waterous said the agreed nature of the transaction had been particularly attractive for BHP in the wake of its rejected $US40 billion hostile bid for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.
 Lots of the time you can figure out who the pretty girls are, but sometimes the pretty girls don't want to dance with you,  he told the Canadian newspaper.  So what you really have to figure out is who looks attractive, but conversely who is still going to want to dance with you. 
Credit Suisse analyst Paul McTaggart said he viewed BHP's acquisition positively because it was a self-funding, expandable business being acquired at a cyclical low in US gas prices. He estimated the Fayetteville assets will produce earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins of more than 30 per cent, in line with BHP's other high-returning businesses.
Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Young said the Fayetteville deal would boost the proportion of BHP's EBIT from petroleum next year only from 19 per cent to 20 per cent. But as the assets are expanded, he believes it can help lift the proportion of petroleum earnings by 2020 to 35 per cent, up from his previous prediction of 30 per cent.
 We like this deal and believe this could represent a broader push by BHP into shale gas when US gas prices are under pressure,  he said.
Wood Mackenzie ranks the Fayetteville assets, which are relatively shallow, among the most economically attractive North American shale gas assets.
KEY POINTS Chesapeake Energy CEO Aubrey McClendon said the company was  very sad  about selling its Fayetteville gas assets to BHP. Credit Suisse believes the Fayetteville assets will achieve an EBIT of more than 30pc.

Origin Energy has cleared the decks ahead of a potential multi-billion dollar series of equity raisings to fund its NSW power and liquefied natural gas investments, taking $440 million of charges that drove it to a first-half loss.
 But news of a potential deferral of $US1 billion of milestone payments by its LNG project partner ConocoPhillips has left investors concerned that Origin will have to bear a bigger cost burden for the venture, which secured environmental approval by Canberra this week.
Charges on investments in geothermal energy and costs associated with the NSW power acquisition swung Origin into a net loss of $136 million for the first half from a $371 million profit for the year-earlier period.
Underlying net profit â€“ which excludes the one off costs â€“ dropped 14 per cent to $304 million, falling short of analysts' expectations for a roughly flat figure to the $355 million reported a year earlier.
The company said it still expected its full-year underlying profit to grow by 10-15 per cent, with the range reflecting the timing for raising new equity. It had previously given guidance of about a 15 per cent increase.
Origin's shares fell 3.5 per cent yesterday to $15.91, their biggest drop for nine months. The stock is at its lowest since early December.
Analysts focused yesterday on the news of the potential deferral of the milestone payments for APLNG. The venture has missed its end-2010 target for a final investment decision, although managing director Grant King yesterday maintained the 2015 schedule for first production, with a go-ahead for the project later this year.
 It's not an insignificant amount of money if we were expecting Conoco to carry a billion dollars worth of capex over the next four years and that is now no longer there so Origin now has to carry it,  said Xavier Grunauer, Nomura's energy equity analyst in Sydney.
 It just raises the amount of financing, whether it's project financing, debt or equity, that this company is going to have to raise. 
Mr King said yesterday that Origin was focused on an equity raising to refinance the debt-funded $3.25 billion purchase of retailing companies Country Energy and Integral Energy, and the Eraring Energy power trading contract, from the NSW government. The purchase is due to complete next Tuesday.
The raising, which would be less than the debt taken on for the NSW deal, would also take into account Origin's commitment to participate in a share sale planned by 51 per cent-owned Contact Energy in New Zealand to help fund a $NZ623 million geothermal power project.
 We know what's in front of us with the NSW capital requirements we haven't yet made a decision on APLNG  said Karen Moses, Origin's executive director, finance and strategy.  How to fund APLNG will be relevant to that decision at the time. 
Mr King said that despite the statutory loss, Origin had  very strong  growth in underlying profit with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation on that basis rising 16 per cent to $818 million.
Full-year underlying EBITDA should rise by about 35 per cent compared with last year, he said. Origin felt the effects in the half of a lack of success in its oil and gas exploration program, triggering almost $100 million of exploration writeoffs.
Earnings from the exploration and production business still rose 20 per cent to $125 million, while EBITDA from power generation jumped 47 per cent, buoyed by the start-up of a power plant in Queensland. Earnings from the retail business gained 15 per cent, beating some forecasts.
Origin flagged $10-$15 million of costs in the second half to recover from flood damage in Queensland while volatile weather in eastern Australia will also take a toll.
project shows there's still a bright side
While the market was absorbed with the negative side of news about the Australia Pacific LNG project, the rearranging of Origin's deal with partner ConocoPhillips also signalled the pair was on the verge of a breakthrough on the customer front.
Certain to meet the 2015 target for starting exports, which was confirmed again yesterday by managing director Grant King, a final investment decision cannot be more than months away.
It was a matter of reading between the lines given Mr King would not reveal the circumstances of where the $US1 billion of payments would be deferred. But he was at pains to point out that should that occur, it would be a  net plus  for the project.
 People ought to be interpreting this as a sign that things are really starting to progress quite substantially,  he told The Australian Financial Review.
Signing up customers for the 8.5 million tonne-a-year first phase of the project would address the major issue troubling Origin's share price over the past months. But Mr King was still struggling yesterday to dispel a theory in the market that the rejigging of the accord must reflect poorly on the economics of the $20 billion first phase of the project.
Rather, he argued, it takes into account the fact that by the end of June, Conoco would have sunk more than $7 billion into APLNG, including an advance payment of more than $6 billion under the generous terms of the original October 2008 deal.
Conoco's total commitment is closer to $9.2 billion even before the milestone payments. Relieving the US major of an obligation to pay another $US500 million per train on an investment decision of the first two trains, helps match up the interests of the partners, at least when assessing a project go-ahead.
 It's much easier to proceed if everybody's view is the same,  Mr King said.
The parallel to look to is the Gladstone LNG project. In September, Santos announced partner Petronas would escape its original commitment to pay a $US500 million bonus once the GLNG partners approved the development of a second train.
That news came at the same time partners sold down a chunk of project equity to major European LNG player Total, which also agreed to buy gas and propelled the venture towards a final investment decision.
Origin expects to end up with 35 to 40 per cent of equity in APLNG, with Conoco likely to hold the same, so deals to sign up customers who would buy up to 30 per cent of the project between them should be just around the corner.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Origin Energy's results may have spooked the market yesterday, but better news could be around the corner.
The company is believed to be about to secure the first of the long-awaited liquefied natural gas offtake contracts needed to underpin its $35 billion Australia Pacific LNG project in Queensland.
 The offtake agreement could well provide the perfect springboard for what is increasingly shaping as the first of two equity raisings this year.
Among the parties tipped as the most likely possible customers for APLNG are China's Sinopec, India's Petronet and, as an outside chance, Korea Gas.
Securing a maiden customer could finally cause the market to attribute some value from the potentially transformational APLNG project into the Origin share price.
APLNG simply won't get off the ground without committed customers, and Origin's lack of progress on that front is the chief concern among investors in the stock.
As well as providing the customer that the market is waiting for, any offtake deal would include a sale of equity in the project that would give a timely see-through valuation of Origin's stake.
A rally in Origin shares following confirmation of a customer would be a good opportunity to launch the equity raising that would help fund Origin's $3.25 billion NSW power acquisitions.
Origin is due to settle the NSW acquisitions next Tuesday, drawing down a bridging facility to cover the purchase.
That gives it some breathing space before it needs to raise equity, but it's unlikely to provide sufficient time for APLNG to progress to a final investment decision.
Origin had originally hoped to carry out a single equity raising to fund both the NSW purchase and top up cash for APLNG's construction, but the slower than expected progress of APLNG means it could be forced to double-dip.
The second raising would follow the eventual approval of APLNG.
Suggestions yesterday that Origin's partner in APLNG, United States giant ConocoPhillips, could be spared a $1.15Â billion payment that was supposed to be made to Origin upon a final investment decision, understandably sat awkwardly with the market.
But it is worth remembering that Santos spared its partner in the Gladstone LNG project, Malaysia's Petronas, a similar milestone payment last year. The concerns about that move were forgotten as Santos snapped up customers for GLNG, and Santos shares have rallied ever since.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The state government has given Eastern Star Gas more time to find land on which to plant trees to compensate for habitat destroyed in the building of a 32-kilometre pipeline near Narrabri, in north-west New South Wales.
The pipeline is part of an expansion at the company's methane-fired coal seam gas Wilga Park Power Station.
 ESG now has until August to identify up to 45 hectares for a so-called  compensatory habitat package , listed as one of the project's conditions of approval in 2008.
General Manager of Stakeholder Relations, Peter Fox, says the company is optimistic that nearby landholders will want to sell land for the re-vegetation.
 With the number of options that we've got available to us we'd fully expect to be able to find landholders that are happy to agree to have this happen,  he said.
 Once we've identified sites that actually work from a practical point of view it would then be natural, as the next step, to talk to those landholders. 
Mr Fox says only about half the habitat along the pipeline route was disturbed.
 The area we've affected is about 15 hectares and we'll be looking to off-set on a like-for-like basis,  he said.
 But we're looking to acquire and conserve about 45 hectares of land that's got a similar ecological value as the land we've affected. 
Vegetation mapping, undertaken by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, was used to identify potential off-set sites.
This mapping was cross referenced with NSW herbarium records to verify that key species were present in the target vegetation communities.

AGEE,The Age,2011,1,"ORIGIN Energy has pleased the market by announcing an offtake agreement and equity stake in its $35 billion Queensland liquefied natural gas project worth tens of billions of dollars.
Origin said it had signed a heads of agreement with China Petrochemical Corporation, or Sinopec, to provide 4.3 million tonnes of gas a year for 20 years from 2015 â€” the largest Australian deal involving coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas.
 Sinopec will take a 15 per cent stake in Australia Pacific LNG, reducing Origin and ConocoPhillips' interest to 42.5 per cent each.
This came only a day after Origin's shares were hammered when it revealed it had allowed ConocoPhillips to defer payments potentially worth $US1 billion. Origin recovered all Thursday's losses and then some, shooting up 92Â¢, or almost 6 per cent, to $16.83.
Managing director Grant King said talks were continuing with other partners, believed to include Thailand's PTT, to sell the rest of the 9 million tonnes of gas a year from its two-train project.
 The message is, of course, to other customers with whom we are in discussion . . . that our project is now building some very substantial momentum, and one would have to have increasing confidence that it is likely to proceed,  he said.
 I would qualify that by saying there is still a lot more to be done, particularly arrangements around contractors being put in place. 
Mr King said he expected to make a final investment decision later this year.
Investors have been waiting for Origin to announce an offtake agreement since it missed its end-of-2010 target for a final investment decision.
Rivals BG and Santos have already given their neighbouring Gladstone LNG projects the green light.
Origin yesterday refused to reveal how much the deal was worth but, based on present LNG prices and including the equity stake, it is believed to be in the tens of billions of dollars.
Conoco chairman and chief executive Jim Mulva said the announcement was a milestone for the joint venture.
 We look forward to welcoming Sinopec into the Australia Pacific LNG project as an equity partner and foundation buyer of LNG,  he said.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"ENERGY
THE Australia Pacific LNG project will step up negotiations with Thailand's major fuel importer after yesterday sealing with Chinese company Sinopec the biggest export deal for liquefied natural gas from Queensland.
 Earlier this week Australia Pacific, a joint venture between Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips, received approval from the federal government, after getting the nod from the Queensland government for its massive $35 billion project to convert coal seam methane gas to liquid natural gas at Gladstone, in central Queensland.
The government approvals have triggered more activity with customers, with Origin being able to access US giant Conoco's list of fuel buyers.
Origin managing director Grant King said yesterday that Australia Pacific had been in discussions with Sinopec for ``several months'', and the company was involved in further discussions with other possible buyers in Asia.
The talks were revealed by The Australian in December.
``We've said for some time that we are in discussions with customers whose requirements can trigger the project,'' Mr King said.
``Quite clearly, this announcement today evidences that.
``This clearly increases confidence the project will proceed, so we would expect now to intensify the dialogue we have with potential customers for the project.''
While there are other possible customers for Australia Pacific in India and Japan, Thailand's PPT is the most advanced because it has deliberately set out to buy natural gas.
PPT, a government-owned enterprise, is building a large terminal at Map Ta Phut Industrial

Estate in Rayong, which is scheduled to begin receiving LNG supplies from later this year.
Likewise, Sinopec earlier this year outlined plans to build a terminal in southern China capable of taking 3 million tonnes a year from 2014, but it already is able to import LNG.
Despite yesterday's announcement of the Sinopec deal. Australia Pacific still has to make a final investment decision, placing it behind the Santos and British-owned gas projects.
However, Mr King said that the company was now obligated to start delivering LNG to Singapore by 2015.
``This clearly increases confidence that we're getting a lot of momentum behind us and that the project will proceed,'' he said.
The company was likely to announce a final investment decision before the last quarter of this year. Mr King said yesterday: ``There is still much to be done before we make that final investment decision''.
Yesterday's deal with Sinopec means the Chinese company will assume 15 per cent of the project and in return get 4.3 million tonnes of LNG annually for 20 years.
This is the biggest deal for any of the Queensland LNG projects, trumping Queensland Gas's 20-year, 3.6 million tonne annual contract with China National Offshore Oil Corporation and its 20-year, 3 million tonne annual deal with Singapore.
Origin and Conoco previously had 50 per cent each of the project but now have 42.5 per cent each, and Mr King indicated the company could sell down further. ``For the right customer arrangements, we would be willing to put more equity on the table,'' he said.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"OPINION & ANALYSIS
ONE of the claims made against the coal seam gas industry in NSW is that there is a lack of regulation of exploration. The claim was repeated this week in the Newcastle Herald by Andrew Margan, the president of the Hunter Valley Wine Industry Association, who also said:  One cannot blame the gas companies for taking advantage of the loose regulations surrounding the gas exploration licences available in this state. 
 AGL recognises that people have concerns about what happens in their area and that they want to know that companies are not able to destroy their environment. But it is untrue to say coal seam gas is unregulated.
Belinda Robinson, the chief executive officer of the oil and gas industry body APPEA, said this week:  Australia's CSG [coal seam gas] industry is the most carefully scrutinised and heavily regulated in the country. 
Consider the following summary of legislation and regulation covering AGL's Hunter Gas Project.
- Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979: this sets out the process for assessing all proposals for development and requires that environmental assessments be carried out for certain activities, including gas exploration.
- Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997: administered by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, this lets the government set out explicit protection of environment policies that make it an offence in NSW to pollute the environment.
- Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991: petroleum title will only be granted subject to demonstrating protection of the environment.
- Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999: this protects matters of national environmental significance.
- Contaminated Land Management Act 1997: requires incidents to be reported to the Environmental Protection Authority that are likely to be  a significant risk of harm .
- Water Management Act 2000: controlled activity approval is required for  waterfront land  activities within 40 metres of a watercourse, and licences are required for water extraction and irrigation.
- Water Act 1912: licences are required for drilling and testing.
- Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995: protects threatened flora and fauna.
- Heritage Act 1977: relates to disturbing relics.
- National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974: a permit is required to excavate archaeological sites.
- Native Vegetation Act 2003: a permit is required for clearance of native vegetation.
- Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001: regarding dangerous goods.
- Roads Act 1993: consent is needed for activities likely to impact on roads network.
- Rural Fires Act 1997: sets out fire safety controls.
- Noxious Weeds Act 1993: authorities must be notified of notifiable weeds.
- National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007: local environmental plans set out land zonings and the types of development that can be carried out with and without consent, along with activities that are prohibited in certain areas.
Also, AGL has gained agreements with each land owner and environmental assessments for each exploration hole in the Hunter.
We have licences for all our exploration holes, groundwater monitoring bores and agricultural irrigation bores.
We have voluntarily conducted groundwater monitoring surveys to assure ourselves and the community that our exploration activities are not having a negative impact on water resources. Studies have shown no connectivity between deep coal seams and shallow aquifer systems.
There are now 16 monitoring bores in the Broke-Bulga area with more than two years of water level and water quality data at some sites.
We happily comply with regulations, but as an industry leader, aim to exceed them.
As a company with nearly 175 years' history, we wouldn't be doing these things if we thought they harmed communities and the environment.
AGL has been in the CSG industry for a decade and produces 6 per cent of the state's natural gas requirements at our Camden Gas Project in south-west Sydney. We have the experience and expertise to answer people's questions and to let them know that the CSG industry can co-exist with other land uses, including tourism and winemaking.
Last year a number of local winemakers carried out winemaking services for AGL using the fruit from our vineyard in the Hunter, which resulted in an excellent vintage.
We have drilled exploration wells on our property and the vineyards continue to thrive under the watchful eye of Brian McGuigan.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Origin Energy has snared Sinopec as a first foundation customer for its flagship liquefied natural gas project in Queensland in a $90â€Šâ€Šbillion-plus record deal that is expected to accelerate work to sign up other gas buyers in Asia.
The long-awaited deal, which is not yet binding, will also see the Chinese oil major take a 15 per cent stake in the Australia Pacific LNG venture, which is running behind its original timetable.
 The accord represents a major milestone for the venture in Gladstone, which won environmental clearance from Canberra earlier in the week and which needs to reach a final investment decision this year to meet its timetable of starting exports in 2015.
The 20-year accord for Sinopec to buy up to 4.3 million tonnes a year of LNG means Origin and US partner ConocoPhillips have sold almost half of the capacity available from the first 9 million tonnes per year phase of the $35â€Šâ€Šbillion project.
It also reduces both Origin's and ConocoPhillips' stakes in APLNG to 42.5 per cent, expected to fall further to 35 to 40 per cent as more customers sign up.
 This clearly increases confidence the project will proceed so we would expect now to intensify the dialogue we are having with other potential customers,  Origin managing director Grant King said on Friday.
India's Petronet LNG has been named among other potential customers.
News of the deal came a day after Origin revealed its venture with Conoco had been rejigged to allow the US major to potentially defer paying an extra $US1 billion once the project got the green light. That sparked doubts about the project economics.
 This signals that this venture is well and truly back on track and we can now expect them to get to a final investment decision this year,  said Tony Regan, an LNG consultant at Tri-Zen International in Singapore.
The APLNG project has fallen behind rival ventures planned also on Gladstone's Curtis Island by UK gas giant BG Group and Santos which are already in the early stages of construction.
The LNG sale, if firmed up, would be the largest single contract by an Australian venture, outdoing Chevron's 20-year deal in 2009 to sell 4.1 million tonnes per year of LNG to Tokyo Electric Power from its Wheatstone project in Western Australia.
The Tepco deal was said to be worth about $90 billion, making the Sinopec LNG sales accord potentially worth about $94 billion. Mr King yesterday said he was  very comfortable  with the pricing.
The deal means that all three Chinese oil giants are now major partners in Queensland's revolutionary LNG industry, which will use gas extracted from underground coal seams rather than from conventional fields.
CNOOC is the biggest customer for BG's venture, while PetroChina is working with Royal Dutch Shell in a similar project.
The APLNG accord was signed on Friday in Beijing by Conoco chief executive Jim Mulva, Origin chairman Kevin McCann and Sinopec president Su Shulin.
Sinopec said the deal would help it diversify its natural gas supply.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"It was particularly interesting to see Macquarie Group chairman David Clarke appearing on this week's Four Corners program on the ABC.
As well as concerns about coal-seam gas exploration in Queensland, the program had a look at the issue of CSG around the Hunter Valley, NSW, community of Broke.
 Clarke is backing protesters in the area who are concerned about the recent spate of CSG exploration projects popping up nearby.
And Clarke, who owns a winery and restaurant in the Hunter â€“ and those wags who see the irony in someone from Macquarie having investments near a place called Broke are being a bit unfair â€“ shares their concerns.
The Macquarie chairman did admit to camera that he usually isn't involved in these sorts of protests, save for having  done it once before down at a high-rise development down at Double Bay  in Sydney.
When questioned as to whether, given he's part of the corporate sector, Clarke is usually on the other side of these sort of protests, he replied with a laugh:  Yeah often. 
Well, it turns out that is also the case with Clarke and the CSG sector, in which he has a bit of previous involvement.
Clarke has been a director of Macquarie subsidiary Bond Street Investments since 1985.
Under his directorship, Bond Street founded CSG company CH4 in 2000, teaming with long-time Queensland resources identity and Bandanna Energy director Jeremy Barlow to buy exploration rights for a parcel of Queensland land from BHP Billiton. The venture was a success and agreements were signed to supply gas to Townsville.
CH4 Gas listed on the Australian Securities Exchange four years later and thrived, save for a rather strange share-price plunge just after the float â€“ which was, incidentally, underwritten by Macquarie Equity Capital Markets.
The shares listed at $1.25 each but soon plummeted by 20Â¢ in one day of trading. Why? Well it could have been a note written by Macquarie Research Equities that suggested CH4 would continue to  trade in line with the market  (which was then about $1.23 a share) because  management can add further value .
All well and good, except that the note valued the stock between 53Â¢ and 78Â¢ a share. Oh dear. But at least the Chinese walls were working at Macquarie back then.
But things turned out well in the end for the Bond Street boys and Barlow, with CH4 getting taken over by Arrow Energy in 2006. The deal meant CH4 shareholders got 2.15 Arrow shares for every CH4 share, and further options on Arrow shares.
The good news got even better for all parties when Arrow was taken over by Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina in a $3.4 billion deal last year.
Who says having a dabble in the CSG sector isn't a bad thing, no matter where one's house or winery is located.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"LNG CANBERRA, Feb 28 AAP - The boom in the natural gas sector will lift Australia's prosperity and aid the clean energy debate, Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson says.
Mr Ferguson said the liquefied natural gas sector (LNG) was exceptionally important to the nation's economic future.
  Within five years, we expect to climb further up the ladder with exports exceeding 50 million tonnes,  he said in Canberra on Monday.
 That effectively means that only Qatar will be exporting more than Australia. This growth is underpinned by long term contracts. 
Australia was the fourth largest exporter of LNG, $8 billion in 2010, and this would grow as more nations searched for lower carbon emitting fuels, Mr Ferguson said.
 In the last 12 months we have also achieved our first long term contracts with India and Korea,  he said.
 One of the reasons is because of the clean energy debate. 
Mr Ferguson said gas and wind would be the early growth sectors in clean energy if Australia established a price on carbon along with a renewable energy target.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced a carbon price would be introduced from July 2012, but decisions were yet to be made on what sectors would be included.
Overseas companies were eyeing opportunities in investing in LNG projects within Australia, Mr Ferguson said.
Last week US energy producer ConocoPhillips announced China Petrochemical Corporation would become a minor partner in its LNG project with Origin Energy, Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd.
 Our reputation as a reliable supplier and the long-term demand in the region in which we live is the reason why companies such as ConocoPhillips are investing in Australia,  he said.
 In just the last three months, the coal seam methane sector in Australia alone with two projects that are new investment decisions worth $31 billion. 
Local workers would benefit from the investment in skills to supply the workforce for the expanding clean energy sector, Mr Ferguson said.

Several projects in the region's north, south and west are likely to be the subject of long-running planning battles.
 The Illawarra has had coal mining for 150 years, but it's rarely attracted the same attention as the new player, coal seam gas.
Rhetoric is heating up ahead of the NSW election and it blew up in Wollongong last Thursday when Planning Minister Tony Kelly detailed a new coal and gas strategy. Members of the public accused the minister of ignoring the environmental consequences of mining.
The NSW Minerals Council has also taken sides via a series of forums, with its leaders calling on politicians to lock in their support for the coal industry.
In Wollongong this month, minerals council CEO Nikki Williams said coal was the  driving force  of the NSW economy.
Independent candidate Gordon Bradbery spoke of the looming battle.
 You have these two competing interests which are very powerful,  he said.
 It's going to be centred [on] arguments about the use of land, particularly agricultural land. That is a tension that's going to get worse and worse and more challenging for all of us,  Mr Bradbery warned.
The fast-growing coal seam industry has attracted controversy amid concerns over its alleged effect on underground water bodies, its impact on agricultural land and fears of contamination caused by chemicals associated with gas extraction.
The NSW Farmers Association and the Greens want a moratorium on new projects until there is a statewide strategy. Concerns centre on the process of hydraulic fracturing - known as  fracking  - where water, sand and chemicals are blasted into a coal seam to break it up and allow methane gas to escape.
Some companies have escaped censure. Illawarra Coal extracts methane from its Appin mines to reduce the danger of explosions underground and then burns the gas to make electricity.
Other exploration permits may not be as simple. Apex Energy is facing opposition from residents and greens over its plan to sink 15 wells at Darkes Forest and on the escarpment between Austinmer and Stanwell Tops. It has applied for one more, on Sydney Catchment Authority land.
Apex says there are  no obvious environmental constraints  on the development, and plans thorough monitoring and management of flora and fauna. To the south, Leichhardt Resources has a petroleum exploration licence for 3173sqkm of Shoalhaven, extending from Shellharbour to Nowra and west to Berrima. Planet Gas will conduct the exploration.
 The Illawarra Coal Measures contain 11 named coal seams, including four main prospective target seams, those being the Bulli, Balgownie, Wongawilli and Tongarra Seams,  Planet says in a quarterly activities statement, indicating its intent.
The lease includes land near Robertson, where water conservation activist Denis Wilson has a nature photography blog. He said the scale of coal seam gas projects was often larger than realised.
 Where they're large systems of bores, they often have bores at 200m intervals. That ends up cleaning up quite a bit of farming land. 
The issue is unlikely to be defused by the election. The Coalition's policy has drawn praise from both sides of the mining divide, but shadow treasurer Mike Baird made it clear where he stands at a Minerals Council forum this month:
 We've got reserves and coal seam gas is critical to maximising ... growth,  he said.
The Government is on the same page.
 It is considered that NSW has excellent potential for ... gas resources, which would have a dramatic effect on competition in the energy markets in eastern Australia,  the Department of Industry and Investment's policy states on its website.
MINING PROPOSALS IN THE REGION
COAL SEAM GAS:
â–  Apex Energy has permission to sink 15 wells in the northern Illawarra, at Darkes Forest and around the escarpment between Austinmer and Stanwell Tops. It has applied for one more, on Sydney Catchment Authority land.
â–  Leichhardt Resources has the 3173 sq km Shoalhaven Petroleum Exploration Licence, extending from Shellharbour past Nowra, through Robertson and west to Berrima.
â–  AGL's Camden gas lease extends from the north of the Leichhardt lease to Campbelltown and the Warragamba Dam.
â–  Planet Gas has approached landowners outside Mittagong for permission to conduct seismic testing on the area.
COAL:
â–  POSCO/Cockatoo Coal has an exploration licence which runs under the village of Sutton Forest, including under Nicole Kidman's house.
â–  Gujarat NRE Coking Coal wants to upgrade and expand mines at Russell Vale and Wongawilli. Russell Vale locals have protested.
â–  BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal wants to expand its Appin and West Cliff mines and could mine under the Dharawal State Conservation Area.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Origin Energy's landmark liquefied natural gas offtake deal with Chinese energy giant Sinopec is expected to pave the way for a series of smaller offtake deals, bringing some much-need momentum to Origin's $35 billion Australia Pacific LNG project.
Origin and its partner in APLNG, ConocoPhillips of the United States, revealed on Friday that they had signed a heads of agreement to sell 4.3 million tonnes of LNG to Sinopec each year for 20 years.
 Sinopec has also agreed to buy a 15Â per cent equity stake in the project.
The deal is expected to be among the largest ever signed out of Australia, with its value tipped to be as much as $90 billion.
The agreement represents a crucial development for APLNG, which will not be able to get off the ground unless committed long-term customers are secured.
Origin shares had been trading sideways in recent months as investor concerns about the lack of offtake deals from APLNG mounted. Origin shares rallied almost 6 per cent on Friday afternoon after the Sinopec accord was announced.
Analysts said the securing of a maiden customer for APLNG was likely to trigger smaller offtake agreements in coming months as confidence in the project increased.
India's Petronet has consistently spoken of its desire to source LNG from Australia and has long been tipped as a potential customer for the project, while more recently Korea Gas has emerged as a surprise potential customer for APLNG.
Kogas â€“the world's largest single buyer of LNG â€“ is already a partner and cornerstone customer for the Santos-led Gladstone LNG project that will adjoin APLNG, but it is on the lookout for more gas volumes and has strong historical ties to ConocoPhillips.
Origin has not yet released the details of the value of the gas to be sold to Sinopec or the price of the 15Â per cent stake in the project.
Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Jason Mabee estimated Sinopec's stake could be worth around $1.2 billion, and said the deal was likely to leave the project partners in a position to make a final investment decision (FID) on APLNG in the coming months.
The Sinopec deal would  flush out  other buyers soon, Mr Mabee said.  Once this is complete, we expect FID to be close behind, along with an equity raising. 
Origin is set to carry out at least one, if not two, equity raisings this year as it shores up its balance sheet.
Origin will settle its $3.25 billion acquisition of privatised NSW power assets tomorrow, while the increased likelihood of a final investment decision on APLNG this year means it will be looking for funding for its share of the project's estimated first stage capital costs of around $20 billion. Mr Mabee expects Origin to raise around $3 billion in equity.
While the heads of agreement with Sinopec was welcomed as an overall favourable development for APLNG, analysts raised some concerns over Sinopec's LNG requirements and the likely price agreed between the parties.
Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee noted that Sinopec had no projected need for incremental LNG in the short-term. That sits in contrast to the other Chinese energy companies that have signed up for LNG from Queensland to date, with PetroChina and CNOOC projected to have substantial LNG needs in coming years.
 We do not believe Sinopec requires the LNG volumes to meet its gas obligations. As a result, we think the driver for Sinopec to agree to the deal was price,  Mr Hirjee said.
He also pointed to Sinopec's dealings on its recent agreement to buy gas from the Papua New Guinea LNG project. In that instance, Sinopec sought to renegotiate a lower price for gas from the project between signing the original heads of agreement and converting it into a binding deal.
The Sinopec deal would effectively underpin one of the two LNG trains, or processing lines, planned for the first phase of development at APLNG, said Macquarie Research analyst Adrian Wood.
He agreed that the deal was likely to encourage other potential customers to sign up to the project.
 While such a large contract with a Chinese customer may cause some nervousness, especially as Sinopec is a smaller player in the Chinese gas market, this is nevertheless likely to generate competitive tension, which could prompt other parties to sign up,  Mr Wood said.
At present, Sinopec plans to import gas from APLNG via a proposed terminal in southern China.
An investment decision on APLNG had originally been scheduled to be finalised by the end of last year. Origin has since declined to set a specific deadline for the project's approval, although it has maintained its 2015 target for first production.
KEY POINTS Origin is to sell 4.3 million tonnes of LNG a year to Sinopec for 20 years. Analysts expect Friday's deal will prompt more customers to sign up. Origin will now be able to start raising funds for the project.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CLIMATE CANBERRA, March 1 AAP - Independent senator Nick Xenophon has called on the federal government to consider making natural gas exempt from a carbon tax.
The government's multi-party climate change committee is yet to decide which sectors are included in the tax, although agriculture will be left out.
 Senator Xenophon, who shares the Senate balance of power until July, said cleaner fossil fuels like natural gas should also be exempt from a carbon tax, at least in the short term.
 The problem with the carbon tax is it will punish all fossil fuels equally and there are some fossil fuels such as gas which are 30, 40 per cent cleaner than coal,  he told Sky News on Tuesday.
 It would make sense to use gas as a transitional fuel in the short to medium term so we can achieve those goals. 
On another political matter, Senator Xenophon said he would have supported the opposition's censure motion against Prime Minister Julia Gillard if Labor had a parliamentary majority.
 If the prime minister was in majority government, if she didn't have to work through the constraints of minority government, then I probably would have supported that censure motion against the PM,  he said.
 But the fact is, the prime minister had to make compromises to rearrange policy priorities as a result of being in minority government and if Tony Abbott had formed minority government, I'm sure there would have been compromises on his part as well. 
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has moved two unsuccessful censure motions against the government in the past two question times regarding Labor's plans to price carbon.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2011,1,"It's been a week since ABC's Four Corners program screened â€˜The Gas Rush', which was described as an exposÃ© of the Coal Seam Gas (CSG) industry in both the local region and further south in NSW.
But despite lobbyists such as Basin Sustainability Alliance (BSA) welcoming the coverage as â€œhighlighting the lack of monitoring and regulation in the industryâ€?, other key players are not impressed.
 Western Downs Region Mayor Ray Brown felt the program was selective and wasted the opportunity it had to interview former Queensland Minister for Natural Resource, Mining and Energy Stephen Robertson.
â€œMatt Carney (the interviewer) could've gone a lot deeper with the Minister, why didn't he ask about Cougar's operations at Kingaroy and why they were shut down?â€? Cr Brown asked.
â€œThe Government keeps on talking about safeguarding and making good.
â€œWell, the Cougar incident was an example of just where something had gone drastically wrong and we haven't really got to the bottom of it, but it was obviously severe for the government to shut it down so why wasn't the Minister quizzed on this?
â€œWe don't want to have to have a contamination and see a company's operations shut down, but we should be learning from the mistakes of others to avoid them in our own region.â€?
Meanwhile Queensland Gas Company believes it wasn't given a fair hearing with a spokesman saying it â€œleft an impression that we have been other than forthright and honest in our dealings with landholders, that our operations are unsafe, and that our operations are compromising groundwater qualityâ€?.
The spokesman stated QGC is confident its activities pose no unacceptable risk to health and safety or to the environment.
The spokesman did acknowledge some of the concerns raised by landholders were legitimate, but said the company was already aware of these and was working to rectify them.
The spokesman said QGC workers do not enter properties without landholder's consent and was adamant in highlighting the fact that the company had never taken a landholder to court to do so.
But the company's stance won't deter lobbyists from continuing to present their claims and push for a moratorium on the CSG industry until they have the answers they are looking for.
Mr Hayllor summed it up when he said BSA was concerned about the impact of CSG development on the quantity and quality of groundwater, the impact on the land including salinity and infrastructure on farmland, the impact on people's ability to make a living from their property and the loss of privacy and lifestyle.
â€œWe fear that CSG is having a negative impact on food security, food quality and food quantity especially when there is ever increasing demand from a growing population,â€? he said.
Mr Hayllor also agreed with Peter Shannon of Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers' who was quoted on the program as saying â€œwe are asking agriculture to bear the cost of this industryâ€?.
â€œThis is not just about the moral rights of individual landholders, it affects communities, it affects our environment, and our country's ability to produce food and fibre in the future,â€? Mr Hayllor said.

TARA, Qld, March 2 AAP - A Queensland community has vowed to stop a coal seam gas company operating in their area.
 People living on small parcels of land near the southwest town of Tara say a broad coalition of protesters will form a blockade to stop a Queensland Gas Company pipeline coming into the community.
The blockade will be launched with a  Hands Off Tara  protest outside Parliament House in Brisbane on Monday.
Another blockade will be established near Tara on Monday, March 14, at the site where a pipeline is due to cross from QGC's Kenya gas field into the estate.
Two to three thousand people, known as  blockies , live in the area known as Tara Estate.
Farmers in the gas-rich Surat Basin have already launched a  Lock the Gate  protest movement opposing gas company attempts to access their land.
Local Michael Bretherick said community action is necessary because the close proximity of neighbours and the number of wells planned by QGC mean the whole community is under threat.
 We have nothing to lose whatsoever by standing up to these people and everything to lose by not standing up to them,  Mr Bretherick said.
 Losing this one is not even an option. 
Mr Bretherick said locals, farmers, property rights advocates, Christian and social justice groups, environmentalists and supporters from across the political spectrum have vowed to support the blockade.
Friends of the Earth organiser Drew Hutton said the non-violent campaign will match the Franklin Dam blockade or the Wet Tropics campaign of the 1980s.
 We're not going to let them on the estate, but we are going to set a protest model for every community in the country faced with the coal seam gas industry,  Mr Hutton said.
Monday's protest will be held at Parliament House at noon.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"Icon's project will produce 2 million tonnes of CSG a year
ENERGY
 PLANS are proceeding for a new export-oriented coal-seam gas area on the Queensland-South Australia border, with processing plants at South Australia's Port Bonython.
Gold Coast-based Icon Energy has a memorandum of understanding with Chinese gas company Shantou SinoEnergy to buy 40 million tonnes of liquid natural gas (LNG) converted from coal- seam gas (CSG), over 20 years.
Icon, along with South Australia-based Beach Energy, is drilling for CSG in the Nappamerri trough of the Cooper Basin.
Icon's plan is to take CSG from this field and pipe it to Port Bonython near Whyalla in South Australia and then export it to Shantou in China, where it will be re-gased and used commercially.
This is similar to the model being adopted in Queensland, where three projects now have state and federal government approval to take coal-seam gas from southern and western Queensland and liquefy it at Gladstone before exporting it to Asia.
Many of the Gladstone projects plan for eventual capacity of up to 9 million tonnes a year, but the Icon/South Australian project is only aiming for 2 million tonnes a year.
Beach already exports liquefied petroleum gas through the Port Bonython terminal operated by Santos, and Icon plans to build up this terminal.
While the Queensland CSG project is the most advanced at the moment, a similar opportunity is being pursued in the Gunnedah Basin in NSW with processing at Newcastle.
Icon managing director Ray James told the Coal Seam Methane world conference in Brisbane yesterday that while the big projects in Gladstone and southern Queensland were attracting most attention, there was plenty of activity among smaller operators such as Icon. ``The first challenge for the medium-sized operators is to get a market, and that's what we've done both through micro-LNG and signing an MOU with Shantou,'' he said.
``Our next challenge is to upgrade that MOU into something far more tangible, and that's something that we'll be working on in the next couple of months.
``But in the meantime, for us smaller companies, there's still a big market in Australia in micro-LNG. Diesel fuel is one, but anywhere in Australia that currently uses LPG, there's an opportunity there for LNG.''
The obvious problem for the Cooper Basin is that its remote location makes development more difficult, an issue exacerbated at the moment because much of the area is flooded.
Even though roads are cut off at the moment, Mr James sees the isolation of the Cooper Basin as a plus.
``All of the sorts of problems they're having now around Dalby you just wouldn't get out in the Cooper Basin, because so few people live out there,'' he said.
While the Queensland government is coming under pressure from farmers and some political groups over the coal seam gas industry, the South Australian government has proved far more welcoming.
South Australian Premier Mike Rann has met Icon Energy and encouraged Icon to explore the South Australian option.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"COAL seam gas explorers in Queensland's Galilee Basin believe they may be able to come up with a better solution to powering the state's northwest minerals province than building an expensive transmission line all the way from Townsville to Mount Isa.
Admitting CSG exploration in the Galilee was in its infancy, Westside Corporation chief executive Julie Beeby told yesterday's Coal Seam Methane WORLD conference in Brisbane that piping basin gas to the northwest could be a more economic proposition.
 Westside has about 14,000sq km of exploration acreage in the northern Galilee about 300km from Mount Isa.
The State Government and other parties are studying the powerline proposal, dubbed CopperString.
Dr Beeby said Westside and joint venture partner Mitsui were building production and reserves at their Meridian joint venture near Moura, where there was room to increase production - which is currently sold to the Queensland gas grid.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Woodside Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte has flagged he won't wait much longer before looking to alternative ways to break the stalemate with East Timor over the $US8.6 billion Greater Sunrise natural gas venture.
Woodside has developed many potential alternative plans for Sunrise, Mr Voelte told The Australian Financial Review.
  We have plans 'B' through to 'R, â€“seriously,  Mr Voelte said.  There are actually 22 plans, and I happen to like one or two of them a lot. 
The project to develop the Sunrise resource has stalled, waiting for the resolution of a dispute over how to develop the field which lies partly in waters jointly administered by Australia and East Timor.
East Timor has previously vowed to block any development that does not involve processing facilities onshore in East Timor, while Woodside and its partners last year chose a floating LNG processing vessel as the best and most economic method to develop the project.
Mr Voelte said his patience was  running a little bit short  with the lack of progress on the project, which under a bilateral treaty between Australia and East Timor requires approval from both governments to proceed.
 Timor-Leste and the Australian government gave us a prescription of how to get to production,  he said.
 We put 300 or 400 million bucks in. Good ethics say they don't hold us up now if we followed all the rules. 
Woodside maintains that processing gas in an LNG plant in East Timor would cost $5 billion more than the FLNG plan.
East Timor Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao in a speech in Washington last week reiterated the government's commitment to building a local oil and gas industry, based around a pipeline from the Sunrise field to the south coast of the island.
But while East Timor is taking a hard public line on Sunrise, the two sides are locked in private negotiations, said East Timor expert Damien Kingsbury at Deakin University.
One of the options on the table is a proposal to ship LNG from a floating plant at Sunrise to East Timor to provide fuel for power generation, Professor Kingsbury said yesterday.  What Woodside is looking at is ways of offering the government some sort of sweetener to make it attractive,  he said.
 The government's principal concern is with infrastructure development and skills and technology transfer, and Woodside is looking at options about how they can do that. 
Mr Voelte, who is to step down as CEO next half, also pointed to some likely further divestments by Woodside. Assets up for sale are smaller interests in exploration ventures as well as its stake in the Laminaria/Corallina project.
But he ruled out selling out of Sunrise,  because we like the property .
Woodside has been streamlining its portfolio in recent years, selling smaller assets that don't fit its focus on LNG and more substantial ventures. Sales have included the Blacktip gas field in the Bonaparte Basin, sold to Italy's Eni, and its interests in the Otway and Kipper gas projects in south-eastern Australia.
Mr Voelte said he was happy with the divestments, particularly of the Kipper project, which has since been hit with a huge cost blowout.
He also said he still regarded the Gulf of Mexico as  a pretty lucrative place to do business  even after the tightening of regulations after BP's drill rig disaster last April.
The regulatory changes had probably improved opportunities for the better operators in the Gulf, Mr Voelte added.
KEY POINTS The CEO says Woodside has about 22 alternative plans for Sunrise. The project has stalled as it requires the approval of both the Timorese and Australian governments.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"Gas delivery station atHexham
COAL seam gas drilling in Gloucester is set to significantly increase, with AGL given approval for up to 110 wells that form the first stage of its $200 million Gloucester gas project and to build a pipeline to Hexham.
 The NSW Planning Assessment Commission has endorsed the project but not before stipulating more conditions than the Department of Planning had initially recommended, amid concerns the coal seam gas industry in NSW  is relatively new .
The project was delegated to the commission for determination because of political donations to both major parties that AGL had declared.
The approval for the project concept plan and for the gas extraction wells in an initial 50-square-kilometre area follows the commission's recent visit to the Stratford area and briefings with department and AGL staff.
Under the plans, a processing plant would be built at one of two potential Gloucester sites and a pipeline built through a 100-metre-wide corridor to Hexham.
A  gas delivery station  would be built at Hexham to link to the existing Sydney-Newcastle gas pipeline.
The commission's report said AGL did not plan to use chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, referred to as BTEX, for hydraulic fracturing to extract coal seam gas.
But the commission specifically banned the use of the chemicals in its approval.
The report said the commission was  conscious  while making its assessment of the  limited extent of experience with commercial coal seam gas extraction  in NSW.
AGL had presented itself as a  competent and responsible commercial operator in this field  and the department had adequately assessed the project, the commission said.
AGL also holds two exploration licences over much of the Hunter, from the outskirts of Newcastle and Cooranbong up to Merriwa.
It is doing exploratory drilling around Broke and has lodged plans for a gas storage plant at Tomago.
As well, Eastern Star Gas has proposed a 280-kilometre pipeline from Coolah to supply the state's first liquefied natural gas export terminal in the Port of Newcastle, which its Narrabri coal seam gas project would supply.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG By Steve Gray
DALBY, Qld, March 3 AAP - Coal seam gas exploration laws in Queensland unfairly advantage the mining industry over individual landowners, a Dalby lawyer says.
 Peter Shannon, who is representing a number of landholders under threat from CSG drilling, said the law was weighted against landholders in several ways.
Companies applying to environmental authorities for gas fields are not required to give full information about their intended activities, Mr Shannon said.
 All they have to do is advertise in a paper circulating in the area,  he said.
 There is no obligation to contact individual landholders, so it comes as a considerable surprise to people to realise there's a process going on in which they want input but know nothing about, because there's no obligation to tell them. 
Mr Shannon said the advertisements are obliquely worded.
 They'll refer to a particular field by name, (but) very few landholders have a concept what the particular fields are named, so seeing the field name advertised means nothing to them. 
He said this hole in the legislation should be filled, so that accurate geographical descriptions are given.
Communications from gas companies was  like learning mandarin  for landholders, he said.
 Two years later, when you can actually talk the language (that the companies use) they say, why didn't you raise this earlier.
 It's because you couldn't talk the bloody language. 
Mr Shannon said the make-good provisions that supposedly require compensation to landowners for damage to water supplies is  hopeless, dire and alarming .
 It is of uncertain duration, it leaves landholders on their own negotiating with industry and they have no commercial clout to negotiate anyway,  Mr Shannon said.
He said current law is doing very little to protect landholders and the community-at-large from the impact of mining on water supplies.
He said compensation applied only to a drop in water availability, not to contamination of the supply except where it relates to a drop in the underground water level.
Coal seam gas, held under the pressure of water, flows to the surface as the water is pumped out.
 As soon as you depressurise all this stuff underground, the gas just wants to get up. That's why we've got all these leaking wells,  he said.
 There's a couple now that are quite serious level-one leaks that have been going for some months.
 These are seriously leaking wells, because once that water level drops the gas wants to get to the surface.
 Eventually all these bores out here become gas wells. 
Mr Shannon said it was obvious the gas explorers had too much influence in drafting Queensland laws as they apply to CSG.
He said rural lobby group AgForce should be pushing for greater use under the law of a provision that obliges companies to avoid  unreasonable interference .
 That is not getting the airplay that it should,  Mr Shannon said.
 The regulator (the state government) up to this point has been promulgating education that doesn't empower landholders. It's been focused entirely on empowering the industry,  Mr Shannon said.
 It has to achieve balance by empowering landholders.

The State government has approved the wells, a processing centre and pipeline near Gloucester.
 Greens MP and mining spokeswoman, Cate Faehrmann, says coal seam gas mining poses huge threats to the community's health and the water supply.
 The Department of Planning approved up to 90 coal seam gas wells for AGL on February 22,  she said.
 This didn't appear on the department's website until February 28.
 The community is extremely concerned about this proposal and for them not to be even notified that this has gone ahead until it hits the department's website is unacceptable.

She says there should be less secrecy and more public consultation before any new coal seam gas mines are approved.
 This is indication of an industry that is operating really, with a degree of secrecy that is unacceptable,  she said.
 It shows that the government is not taking community consultation seriously and is operating in the interests of the industry here and not the general public's.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2011,1,"Chinese Petrochemical purchases first order and 15% of Australia Pacific LNG
Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips have reduced their ownership in the recently federally approved Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project with China Petrochemical Corporation purchasing 15 per cent of the joint venture.
 The purchase reduces Origin and ConocoPhillips ownership to 42.5% each.
Alongside the purchase China Petrochemical, also known as Sinopec, agreed to purchase 4.3 million tonnes of LNG from APLNG annually.
The APLNG project, which will see natural gas from the Surat Basin sent to Gladstone before being shipped to China, was given Federal approval only last week.
Origin Energy chairman and CEO Kevin McCann said the deal was a major boon for the local natural gas industry.
â€œThis agreement with Sinopec is a testament to the scale and quality of the Australian Pacific LNG project, which is based on world-class coal seam reserves and resources in Queensland,â€? he said.
Origin Energy spokesperson Chris Zipf said the deal was a big step for the industry.
â€œIt represents a major milestone and brings the project one step closer to securing and delivering significant opportunities for many local communities as well as broader economic benefits,â€? he said.
â€œEnvironmental approval of the APLNG project was only granted after the Queensland and Federal Governments undertook a rigorous assessment of the planned operations and activities.
â€œImportantly, they also require the implementation of ongoing and detailed planning, environmental management, monitoring and reporting activities for the life of the project.
â€œThe strict conditions and reporting requirements to be applied as a result of this approval process, together with the commitments contained within the APLNG environmental impact statement, complement existing government regulation and policy.â€?
Sinopec's investment in the CSG industry hasn't been without its detractors however, with environmental groups calling the industry out.
Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton said he didn't believe investment in the local gas industry was a wise choice.
â€œI have some advice for any person or company thinking about investing in these (gas) companies â€“ they should think again,â€? he said.
â€œThe do not have community acceptance and will struggle again constant protests from landholders.â€?
Mr Zipf said while Sinopec had taken an equity interest in the project Origin and ConocoPhillips will continue in their existing developments.
â€œWhile Sinopec will now take an equity interest, Origin will continue to focus on developing Australia Pacific LNG's substantial CSG resources in the Surat and Bowen Basins and building a 450 km transmission pipeline as upstream project partner,â€? he said.
â€œConocoPhillips will continue to focus on the construction of a multi-train LNG facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone as downstream project partner.â€?

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"STATE ELECTION 2011
LABOR'S political opponents say Gloucester residents were left in the dark about approval of a major coal seam gas project in the area.
 A decision on the AGL Gloucester Gas project was delegated to the Planning Assessment Commission.
It approved the project on February 22 after imposing a number of conditions but the decision was not made public for about six days.
 The whole process makes a mockery of the supposed 'tough new rules' [for coal seam gas projects] announced late last year,  Greens upper house MP Cate Faehrmann said.
About 150 Gloucester residents met recently to discuss concerns about area mining, and were unaware the project was approved, she said.
Upper Hunter independent state election candidate Tim Duddy said the approval  puts the local water supply and sustainable agricultural industries at risk .
A Planning Assessment Commission spokeswoman said it typically took a few days for paperwork to be processed and for the Department of Planning to be notified and for it, in turn, to notify the proponent and people who had made submissions about a project. Decisions were then made public on the commission's website.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"GORGON PERTH, March 4 AAP - Australia's resource giants are taking measures to increase the amount of local work on major projects, West Australian Premier Colin Barnett says.
Unions have accused oil and gas giant Chevron of sending offshore three quarters of the $10 billion worth of work on its Gorgon liquefied natural gas development it said would be done by Australian companies.
 But Gorgon project general manager Colin Beckett says about $9 billion of that work has been contracted out to WA companies.
Unions WA Secretary Simone McGurk said most of the work contracted out to Australian companies was for earth works, site preparation, catering and waste removal.
And even though Chevron has contracted Australian companies for some manufacturing and fabrication works, those companies have subsequently contracted out the work to be done overseas.
The premier admitted there may be some  leakage  of the work overseas and said no-one was suggesting all work on the heavy modules for Gorgon could possibly be done in Australia.
However he said he had been informed a large amount of work will begin to flow into the state's steel fabrication workshops within the next year.
 The industry tells me the steel fabrication work will start to flow more heavily into workshops probably in the next six to nine months,  he told Fairfax Radio.
 There will be a lot of it and it will last for many years. 
Mr Barnett said he had visited steel fabrication workshop in Kwinana with Woodside managing director Don Voelte, CEO of Rio Tinto's iron ore division Sam Walsh, managing director of Chevron Australia Roy Krzywosinski and president of BHP Billiton iron ore division Ian Ashby.
He said they had an  honest and open discussion  with fabricators in which some of the heads of the four resource companies admitted that after auditing the contracts they had awarded, some of the work ended up offshore.
 They have picked up on the fact they have awarded contracts on the understanding that work would be done here only now to find out some of it had actually been sent overseas,  Mr Barnett said.
 So there will be some corrective measures taken by the companies and it was very big of them to say we have gone back, we have looked and there is a point to this. 
As part of the Gorgon project, Chevron are required to report quarterly to the government on the Australian content in each contract awarded.
Mr Barnett said he would not release those specific reports due to commercial in confidence reasons but he will provide his own report to parliament on the levels of local content being achieved on major projects.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"DREDGING BRISBANE, March 4 AAP - A new dredging project could kill off threatened dugongs that are already starving from the floods in central Queensland, conservationists say.
Gladstone Ports Corporation announced on Friday it had awarded a $1.3 billion contract to dredge Gladstone Port as part of its plan to become one of the world's major Liquid Natural Gas exporters.
 It will be the country's largest dredging project.
Joint venture partners Van Oord and Dredging International Australia are expected to start dredging six million cubic tonnes of material from July.
Marine species policy manager for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Lydia Gibson, said the dredging may be the final straw for marine life already struggling after the floods killed off feeding grounds.
 We know that dugongs along the Queensland coast have lost most of their feeding grounds already after the recent floods,  she told AAP.
 The dredging could be a tipping point for dugongs. Although the full impact of the floods is yet to be known, the accumulative impact - this particular development, the floods, and fishing, would be a death of a thousand cuts for Queensland's dugongs. 
Ms Gibson said the Queensland government has a study under way into the impact of the floods on marine life and she called on the project to be delayed until the report is in.
 The WWF is encouraging the government to hold off on approving the large scale development, particularly in the habitats of threatened marine species, at least until it's assessed the full impact of the floods on marine animals. 
Treasurer Andrew Fraser said stringent environmental conditions had been placed on the project.
 This is to ensure the project has minimal impact on the environs of the Gladstone harbour,  he said in a statement.
 The approval contains a stringent set of dredging conditions, monitoring requirements, ecosystem research plus a range of measures to protect and enhance endangered species.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"UNIONS have accused resources giant Chevron of deceit over its claim that $10 billion of the work on its giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas project was being done in Australia.
UnionsWA secretary Simone McGurk said an analysis of the projects identified by Chevron as work carried out locally showed the true figure was closer to $3bn.
 ``We already knew that Chevron has sent more than 300,000 tonnes of fabricated steel for its Gorgon project offshore. Now we have found that $7.4bn of the $10bn of Gorgon contracts that Chevron claims are performed locally are largely going offshore,'' Ms McGurk said yesterday. ``The worst thing about this revelation is that the work that is going offshore is the skilled engineering and manufacturing work.''
But Gorgon project general manager Colin Beckett stood by Chevron's figure as he took a busload of media to the Australian Marine Complex yesterday to show them fixtures being built there for Gorgon.
Mr Beckett said $20bn of contracts had been awarded so far to overseas and Australian companies and the value of the work from each that was subsequently done locally was $9bn in Western Australia and $1bn in other states.
Mr Beckett said Chevron was required to report quarterly to the government on the Australian participation in each contract it awarded and he was confident of his figures.
Premier Colin Barnett has not responded to requests from The Australian to release the reports.
Mr Beckett said some work could not be done locally and deadlines had forced some to be sent offshore.
He conceded that, while 650 worker accommodation units were being built in South Australia, another 3500 were being built in Thailand because of logistical pressures.
Unions and steel manufacturers plan to rally at state parliament on March 15 to demand more local content in an unprecedented joint campaign.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"AUSTRALIAN gas and oil giant Santos has begun filling some of the 6000 jobs that will be created for the $16 billion Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) plant, with construction slated to be underway this year.
Some 5000 jobs will be in construction of the project, with an additional 1000 permanent jobs in production. Santos chief human resources officer, Petrina Coventry, says around 1500 of these jobs will be created by the end of 2012. ``We've already been hiring for some time,'' she says. ``We have to get the more senior experienced positions in first. At the end of last year, we started hiring civil and construction engineers and project managers.''
 Partnering with other LNG leaders Petronas, Total and Korea Gas Corporation (Kogas), GLNG will pioneer the conversion of coal seam gas into liquefied natural gas, as a cleaner energy source. The project includes the development of coal seam gas resources in the Bowen and Surat Basins in south-east Queensland, construction of a 435km gas pipeline from the gas fields to Gladstone and a gas liquefaction and export facility on Curtis Island.
GLNG engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors include Fluor for upstream surface facilities, Saipem for the gas transmission pipeline and Bechtel for the LNG plant.
All three have already posted dozens of jobs on their websites, which will provide the ``lion's share'' of the 5000 employees, says Ms Coventry.
``We've got a trained workforce ready,'' she adds. ``There will also be some skilled workforce brought in offshore as well as a local, regional and national workforce that already exists. The workforce planning peak will hit in 2013, ramping off as EPCs finish construction and we are left with a more skilled, long-term workforce.''
Of the 1000 permanent jobs, some will come from the existing workforce at Moomba; others will be supported in Queensland by Energy Skills Queensland; while many prospective employees will be encouraged to move up to Gladstone to work on the project.
The company also has a number of graduate programs and ``feeding pools'' to find the right employees, says Ms Coventry.
``We can source instrument and electrical engineers and project managers through the TAFE system,'' says Ms Coventry. ``There are also strong graduate programs, running over 10 years, and we work with partners like the University of Queensland and Adelaide University to source graduates with a geoscience background.''
Despite industry-wide concerns about skills shortages and wage inflation, due to other Queensland multi-billion dollar gas projects both approved and in the pipeline, Ms Coventry says this will not affect the GLNG project.
She adds that the company is working with government and industry bodies to ensure the impact is minimised; making sure the ``right policies from an education and immigration perspective are in place''.
Gladstone mayor Gail Sellers says GLNG is a positive for the region: ``This project, combined with other industrial projects earmarked or under construction in the Gladstone Region, will amount to billions of dollars injected into the local, state and national economy.'' It is expected GLNG will produce its first gas in 2015.

The National Transport Commission has proposed fuel tax credits for truck operators be cut from 15.543 a litre to 15.043 a litre. This would mean a 2.4 per cent increase in the road user charge for operators. The NTC argues that the proposed increase in tax contribution is less than the annual consumer price index increase of 2.8 per cent. It issued a statement outlining its reasoning for the cut, which is based on increased transport network costs. ``The latest set of expenditure figures has resulted in an 8.2 per cent increase in the heavy vehicle cost base. In order to recoup the additional costs assigned to heavy vehicles . . . the road user charge and heavy vehicle registration charges must rise by 2.4 per cent.''

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG BRISBANE, March 7 AAP - Coal seam gas (CSG) mining constitutes one of the biggest land grabs in Australian history, a Brisbane rally has been told.
The rally of environmentalists, The Greens, farmers, property rights groups, the splinter Queensland Party and members of Socialist Alliance voiced fears a planned gas pipeline into a residential area will open it to a large-scale expansion of mining there.
 They condemned a plan by Queensland Gas Company (QGC) to push a pipeline through into the rural residential Tara Estates, 250km southwest of Brisbane.
The Hands Off Tara rally of about 200 people drew about 20 volunteers for a planned blockade of the pipeline route at Tara beginning on Monday, March 14.
Tara resident Scott Collins said governments were telling people that CSG mining was safe and that the industry must meet thousands of environmental conditions.
 If you need thousands of conditions, why are you letting it happen in the first place?  he said.
Mr Collins said the right-of-entry given to CSG companies constituted  one of the biggest legalised thefts of private land in the history of Australia .
 What they're planning for Tara is thousands of wells amongst thousands of people,  he said.
The infrastructure will include compressor stations, gas pipes and water pipes, Mr Collins said.
Dulacca farmer Lee McNicol said landholders all over the world at least have the right to invite mining companies onto their land, but not in this case.
 These people at Tara are saying: no, we don't want you on under the terms that you're currently offering and the way that you operate. 
Mr McNicol is a member of the farmers' group Lock the Gate which has vowed to stop CSG bores on their properties.
Conservationist Sarah Moles said she is concerned about the fate of the Great Artesian Basin if the CSG industry is allowed to proceed.
 The Queensland government is allowing that industry to take unlimited amounts of water from the Great Artesian Basin,  Ms Moles said.
 Unfortunately it's not just water. The water that comes out of the coal seams contains a lot of salt, something like five to eight tonnes per megalitre. 
She said up to 2.8 million tonnes of salt could be brought to the surface by CSG mining to impact local prime farm soils.
 We are squandering some of the best soils on the planet,  Ms Moles said.
Greens senator-elect Larissa Waters said the debate over CSG was about land, water, food and the climate.
 This new industry, coal seam gas, is being absolutely rushed into by both our state and federal governments. 
Ms Waters said the profits would go offshore.
The Greens want a moratorium on CSG until the long-term impacts are known.
Ms Waters said neither governments nor CSG companies know what the long-term impacts of mining will be.
Friends of the Earth organiser Drew Hutton said the Tara blockade would be peaceful but determined.
 What's happening at Tara is the frontline of a war,  Mr Hutton said.
 It's not a shooting war but it's a war nevertheless. 
 We're going to adopt the same sort of approach as people like Ghandi and Martin Luther King pioneered,  Mr Hutton said.
Meanwhile, Queensland's Mines Minister Sterling Hinchliffe told reporters the coal seam gas industry had worked in co-operation with landowners and alongside primary producers for 15 years.
He said the government is committed to best practice in the industry.
 I believe that we've got good arrangements in place, protections for the interests of landowners and I encourage companies to follow best practice,  Mr Hinchliffe said.
The Queensland Party's sole MP, Aidan McLindon, who broke from the opposition LNP in 2010, said he will join the blockade at Tara.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG BRISBANE, March 7 AAP - The Queensland government says it has boosted legal protection for landholders and the environment amid the coal seam gas (CSG) boom in the past year.
Dean Ellwood, assistant director-general of the Department of Environment and Resource Management, listed the government's actions in response to claims by Dalby-based lawyer Peter Shannon that the law favoured miners over landholders.
 Mr Shannon, who is representing a number of landholders under threat from CSG drilling, has said the make-good provisions requiring compensation for landowners for damage to water supplies was  hopeless, dire and alarming .
 We strongly reject the misleading claims made by Mr Shannon,  Mr Ellwood said in statement to AAP.
 Companies must notify affected landholders of their operations - it is a requirement of the Water Act 2000.
 Operators must provide notice to landholders directly of their intention to drill a well or bore; when any work on a landholder's property is completed or altered; their intention to carry out technical, scientific or seismic surveys and when that work is finished,  Mr Ellwood said.
Resource companies must also ensure landholders in the vicinity of any extraction operation continue to have access to a reasonable supply of water, he said.
 We're serious about protecting landholders,  Mr Ellwood said.
 That is why a new LNG Enforcement Unit was created to help landowners access information about CSG monitoring, enforcement and provide support based in Roma, Toowoomba and Dalby. 
Mr Ellwood said peak rural lobby group AgForce also allocated $3.5 million in funding in November last year, over three years, to help landholders effectively negotiate with the CSG industry.
A new CSG stakeholder advisory committee was also created to guide the development and regulation of the CSG industry.
Mr Ellwood said CSG companies were required to mitigate or manage the predicted impacts on existing and new water supply bores as a result of groundwater extraction by entering into  make-good  agreements with bore owners before these impacts occurred.

Brian and his wife Carol say that would be a small price to pay to ensure their grandchildren inherited a healthy environment.
 Down the road at Condamine, Simon Drury also wants what's best for his children and grandkids.
For him, that is the financial security that 40 or so gas wells will bring to his feedlot and the economic and employment benefits that the gas industry will bring to the region.
Landowners will receive between $70,000 and $270,000 a year, depending on the number of wells and impact on agricultural production.
On average, they receive about $2000 annually for each well from Queensland Gas in compensation. Other companies have similar payouts.
Three massive CSG projects are under way - led by Santos, Origin and QGC - to supply gas to export facilities at Gladstone. Investment is expected to reach about $66 billion.
Some landowners will have 70 wells or more and many are demanding $10,000 for each well.
Mr Monk said he and his son David would make a reasonable income ``but once the Great Artesian Basin is gone, it's gone'', he said, voicing the concerns of many farmers about the impacts of coal seam gas on underground water.
The Monks said gas exploration on the property had already ruined the bore water supply and son David is just as adamant that he will refuse access to gas companies wanting to drill on the property.
``We own the land but we are really only caretakers and we have to look after it. All our freedom will be gone and the reason we are holding out is for these young guys,'' Mr Monk said, pointing to four of his eight children.
``We are not safe from this. Once they (the gas companies) get momentum everyone will be finished. We will be gas refugees and we will make sure that we become a problem for a lot of people.''
That could come soon with an expectation that Queensland Gas will start entering the Tara estates within weeks, sparking a major blockade and protest from local residents who have about 500 people from Brisbane who have signed up to activist Drew Hutton's campaign to support them.

Mr Drury is ``happy but hesitant'' about the CSG plans but he said the ongoing compensation was something the companies had to improve.
````There are a lot of passionate people dead against CSG wells but they obviously don't owe enough money or have the financial pressure and can't see the benefits,'' he said.
He said his feedlot will turnover $20 million this year so the gas compensation was a much smaller but welcome income and would add value to any future sale of the property.
``They will be investing millions of dollars. I'm happy to give a bit,'' he said.

 Natural gas production grew strongly on Australia's east coast, where coal seam gas production reached a record 222 PJ, an increase of 43 PJ from the previous year.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) production rose 6.2 per cent to 19.8 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), from 18.6 Mtpa, due to production from a fifth processing train at the Woodside Petroleum Ltd-led North West Shelf operations in Western Australia.

EnergyQuest chief executive Graeme Bethune said momentum in the LNG sector looked set to continue this year, with seven projects in the Australasian region with combined capacity of about 40 Mtpa slated for final investment decisions in 2011.
 So far this year we have already seen another Gladstone LNG project, GLNG, in central Queensland, reaching sanction and the ConocoPhillips/Origin Energy APLNG project, also situated at Gladstone, reaching major milestones,  Dr Bethune said.
He said Australian oil production turned around last year after slumping to a 40-year low of 99 million barrels (MMbbls) in 2009.
Production in 2010 rose 16.2 per cent to 116 MMbbls due to production from BHP Billiton Ltd's Pyrenees, Apache Energy Ltd's Van Gogh and Woodside's Vincent oil fields, all off WA's northwest coast.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"A Scone resident says she is now concerned for local water supplies after viewing the coal seam gas documentary 'Gasland'.
Karen Macdonald was among 140 people who attended last night's screening of the film by the Hunter Valley Thoroughbred Breeders Association.
  Any damage to the water system is something that should not be allowed to happen, it does not matter how small,  Ms Macdonald said.
Coal seam gas exploration is already being carried at several locations west of the Hunter Valley town.
Ms Macdonald was shocked by what she discovered about the industry and is now opposed to its establishment.
 No coal seam gas extraction, they cannot categorically state that there will be no affect and if they can not state that there will be no affect then it should not happen,  she said.
 Look at all the native animals that will be affected, look at the properties that will suffer from this, it just should not be even allowed to happen.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"Concerned property owners say they are determined to stop coal seam gas (CSG) companies from accessing their land on southern Queensland's western Darling Downs.
Dozens of residents and environmentalists rallied outside State Parliament in Brisbane on Monday, calling for a moratorium on new gas wells.
 Scott Collins, from Tara, says the Queensland Gas Company plans to enter properties in the area next week.
 I think there'll be people standing in front of trucks, we don't want to get arrested but we want to prove and make a point that we don't accept it,  he said.
 If they want to start coming in with the heavy hand, you're going to upset a lot of people, you're pushing the wrong buttons. 
Drew Hutton from Friends of the Earth says residents will block the Queensland Gas Company.
 We're going to put our bodies on the line basically in the same way people have done for the past 40 years in this country whenever there's environmentally destructive activity going on,  he said.
 They can sweep us aside but they're going to have to do that to get access to this land. 
Queensland Mining Minister Stirling Hinchliffe says the industry can work in harmony with the residents.
 I believe that we've got good arrangements in place, protection for the interests of landowners and I encourage companies to follow best practice,  he said.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"Rous Water calls for moratorium on exploration of coal seam reserves
ROUS Water has backed calls for a moratorium on coal seam gas mining across NSW â€“ albeit with some serious reservations.
 The Rous Water council has narrowly backed a notice of motion lodged by Lismore City Council representative and deputy chairman David Yarnell, supporting the NSW Farmers Federation's call for a mor-atorium; and to pass the call along to Premier Kristina Keneally, Environment Climate Change and Wat-er Minister Frank Sartor and their opposite numbers in the Coalition (Barry O'Farrell and Lennox Head-based MLC Catherine Cusack).
The council also voted to writeto Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Federal Environment MinisterTony Burke, along with their Opposition counterparts (Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt), to raise the issue on a Federal level.
The vote barely made it through the Rous Water council. It was opp-osed by the Ballina and Richmond Valley representatives â€“ Phillip Silver, Keith Johnson, Stuart George and Col Sullivan â€“ and made it through only on the casting vote of Rous Water chairman and Byron Shire councillor Richard Staples.
The result has also provided fodder for Ballina Christian Democrats candidate Bruce Kemp, who has cited it among his reasons for positioning himself against coal seam gas exploration on the Northern Rivers.
Mr Kemp yesterday conceded he had not yet spoken to Metgasco, the most active of the coal seam gas companies operating on the Northern Rivers, but said he intended to.
In the meantime, he was concerned enough about the potential impacts of coal seam gas drilling on drinking water â€“ notably in the Wilsons River, which is used by Rous Water as a back-up supply when Rocky Creek Dam sinks below 90 per cent full â€“ that he was prepared to champion a cause that had little direct impact on the electorate he hoped to represent.
Ballina Rous Water representative, Councillor Keith Johnson, said he opposed the motion calling for the moratorium because he â€˜didn't see the sense in (Rous Water) politicking on the issue'.
Cr Johnson said any concerns about coal seam gas drilling were the province of the NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water and it was not Rous Water's job to police the way the department did its job.
Personally, Cr Johnson said he had read Metgasco's responses as concerns were raised about coal seam gas drilling and said he was satisfied with them.
Lismore Rous Water representative, Councillor David Yarnall, said it was â€˜important for Rous to voice its concerns as the predominantwater supplier in the region'.
Cr Yarnall said he had been looking at the â€˜precautionary principle' in lodging the motion.
â€œWe need to examine it and make sure we're not opening a Pandora's Box and not having an environmental catastrophe on our hands,â€? he said.
â€œOnce it's in the water table, there's no turning back.â€?

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"WHEN the hordes of protesters turn up to blockade a gas company's entry in Tara, near Chinchilla, next week, June Norman, 70, of Brighton, may be among the first to take them on.
People tell her that, at her age, she should be staying at home rather than taking on a fight hundreds of kilometres away, but she is determined to play a part in stopping the coal seam gas expansion.
 ``I've got grandchildren and great-grandchildren and I'm concerned about the future of Australia and the future we are leaving them,'' she said.
She said as far as she was concerned ``anything is possible'' at the protest, including her volunteering to lie down in front of cars to prevent access.
Activist Drew Hutton was yesterday recruiting Brisbane residents to his cause and claims already to have about 500 people willing to join the campaign in some form.
``We are going to stop them. We have to,'' he said.
QGC will begin burying 16km of pipeline north of Tara next week. It said nearly half of the work will be done on land owned by QGC and landholders directly affected by the work have agreed to compensation packages.
The Lock the Gates campaign against mining and gas companies has also moved to the outskirts of Toowoomba where Blackwood Coal is exploring coal seams at Gowrie Junction.
Resident Lorraine Stern said 700 people turned up for a recent community meeting on the issue and many of those would be turning up to protest at the Bligh Government's Community Cabinet in Toowoomba this weekend.
Mrs Stern said the news of exploration had changed the lives of Gowrie Junction residents. They feared what had happened at nearby Acland, where the town is being consumed by a coal mine.
``Any mining activity in this area would cause massive and irreparable damage to the environment and the community,'' she said. ``There are people living in the community who were victims of the Acland mine and are now facing the possibility of being forced to move again.''

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"THE first shipload of Queensland-sourced natural gas is due to leave Gladstone in 2014. It will be, if projections are right, the beginning of a new and prosperous era for the state - the birth of an industry that will generate billions of dollars for the state and thousands of jobs. Three massive projects are now under way - led by Santos, Origin and QGC - which, when completed, will extract coal seam gas from thousands of wells on the Western Downs and the Surat Basin. The gas will then be transported by pipeline to liquefied natural gas facilities on Gladstone's Curtis Island, before being shipped to customers around the world. The total estimated investment is about $66 billion.
 But as we draw closer to this bright new dawn, opposition to these projects is growing, particularly among those directly affected - landholders, farmers and graziers concerned about their livelihoods and lifestyles. Objectors have also raised concerns about damage to the environment and the Great Artesian Basin by the processes used to extract the gas. They also highlight major potential dangers in dealing with the vast volumes of water - much of it saline - that is brought to the surface with the gas. These are all legitimate concerns that the developers say they are safely addressing. The State Government, for its part, has approved these massive projects, but with hundreds of environmental protection conditions.
But that is not enough to satisfy opponents. Yesterday, a group of about 150 people demonstrated in front of the Queensland Parliament to protest against plans by QGC to run a pipeline into the rural residential community of Tara, 300km west of Brisbane, where locals are promising a blockade to hold contractors at bay. Once again, we have an all-too-common instance of the promoters of progress and development facing off against those who want things to remain as they are.
The challenge for the gas companies is to make sure they do not run straight over the top of that opposition. For some rural landholders the arrival of gas wells on their property will be a genuine windfall and provide long-term financial security, with gas companies paying tens of thousands of dollars a year in compensation. But for others the new income stream simply may not be sufficient to compensate for the disruption to their chosen lifestyle. The gas companies insist they are committed to genuine consultation and engagement with locals and, in the case Tara, QGC said the work has not only been approved under Queensland legislation, but also was expected to have little impact on landholders.
Most Queenslanders will be unaffected by the physical infrastructure of the state's emerging LNG industry, but many of us will have real concerns about its environmental impacts. In this case, the challenge for the gas companies, and the State Government, is to convince us that they have both the science and the rules in place to make sure the environment is protected.
New dawns always arrive with a degree of uncertainty, no matter how promising they might appear. Minimising that uncertainty will be the key to making sure the promise turns into reality.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"For the past 20 years Japan has been Australia's chief customer for liquefied natural gas. But the latest boom in LNG investment will supply a wider spread of emerging Asian customers. Buyers from India, Malaysia, South Korea and China have inked multibillion-dollar LNG purchases with Australian projects in the past year, while similar long-term agreements with customers in Taiwan and Thailand are in the offing. Initial agreements on sales contracts with Taiwan state oil giant CPC Corp and Thailand's PTT, which is due to make its first LNG imports this year, are possible within months. CPC is understood to be in talks to buy 2 million tonnes a year of LNG from Inpex's Ichthys project, which would also sell gas to Japanese utilities. Page 18
 Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak (Tun is a Malaysian honorific awarded to its leaders) is that nation's sixth prime minister since the country was decolonised, the son of his country's second and perhaps best-known leader and father figure, Tun Abdul Razak, and a man who finds himself at an interesting crossroads. Malaysia is poised between its aspirations to achieve developed country status by 2020 and growing competition from other regional economies for trade and investment, not to mention the country's traditional challenges, which derive from a complex ethnic mix that spawns communal tensions rarely far below the surface.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Asian liquefied natural gas buyers are typically keen to capture a chunk of project equity as part of their gas purchase contracts if they can, but it is no easy task.
Securing a seat at the table along with the LNG suppliers not only gives a customer a share of the offtake and first go at additional cargoes, but it also allows access to information on supply costs, pricing and delivery that would otherwise be withheld.
 Just how amenable the suppliers are to sharing the equity largely depends on the strength of the supply project. Asian customers can usually elbow their way into a foundation project more easily than into a lower-risk and more lucrative expansion.
Chevron's Gorgon venture is a case in point, with the US major declaring prospective customers should not necessarily expect a stake, even after welcoming Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and Chubu Electric into the $43 billion foundation phase.
Queensland's industry is different, with the ventures openly offering equity as they sought to persuade Asia's conservative LNG buyers to sign up for unconventionally produced gas from underground coal seams.
For the Queensland gas suppliers, reducing their own stakes helped with risk management and cut their capex burden. But putting a price on equity is tricky and helps explain the snail's pace toward Korea Gas Corp's deal to sign up to Santos's GLNG project.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"For the past 20 years Japan has been Australia's chief customer for liquefied natural gas. But the latest boom in LNG investment will supply a wider spread of emerging Asian buyers.
Buyers from India, Malaysia, South Korea and China have all inked multibillion-dollar LNG purchase deals with Australian projects in the past 12 months, while similar long-term agreements with customers in Taiwan and Thailand are in the offing.
 Initial agreements on sales contracts with Taiwan state oil giant CPC Corp and Thailand's PTT, which is due to make its first LNG imports this year, are possible within months.
CPC is understood to be in talks to buy 2 million tonnes per year of LNG from Inpex's $25 billion Ichthys project, which would also sell gas to a syndicate of Japanese utilities.
Such a deal would be the first between Australia and Taiwan, potentially pre-empting an existing preliminary accord CPC has to buy LNG from Woodside Petroleum's Browse LNG venture in Western Australia, which has yet to be firmed up.
Inpex president Toshiaki Kitamura told a CLSA forum in Tokyo this week that the first sales agreements for Ichthys LNG would be announced within months.
PTT, meanwhile, is believed to be in talks with Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips to buy 1-2 million tonnes per year from their Australia Pacific LNG project in Queensland, according to Citigroup.
The PTT deal would follow the APLNG venture's initial LNG sales agreement announced last week with China's Sinopec, which, if confirmed, would be the biggest individual LNG sales contract in Australia and potentially worth over $90 billion over 20 years, depending on crude oil prices.
India's Petronet LNG, already a customer for gas from Chevron's $43Â billion Gorgon project, is also a potential customer for APLNG.
The huge growth in demand for energy in China and India is giving LNG producers confidence, despite the amount of new capacity planned in Australia.
 Japan is obviously quite a mature market so the market there is really re-contracting,  said Origin managing director Grant King.  But then you've got China, India; these are strong, vibrant, growing economies with large enterprises, and they have very substantial demand for energy. 
APLNG is in  fairly well-matured negotiations  with two or three other potential LNG customers and deals should be signed  over the next few months,  ConocoPhillips' Australia president Todd Creeger told The Australian Financial Review. That would allow a final investment decision on the $18 billion project in mid-2011 and the start of production in 2016.
But a softening in the LNG market over the past 12 months has led to speculation that APLNG will be under pressure to offer a discount on price to get Sinopec to commit to a firm purchase contract.
Citigroup is assuming Sinopec will pay a price based on a 0.135 slope against the crude oil price for gas from APLNG. Slope refers to the relationship between gas prices and the crude oil price on which they are based.
Origin's Grant King declined to comment on pricing other than it was  at market prices , underpinning  robust  economics for APLNG.
But Mr Creeger said the buyer's market that had prevailed over the past 18 months was starting to turn again in favour of LNG producers, particularly for delivery starting in 2015-2016.
 Everybody realises that in the timeframes we are talking about there are really not that many options out there,  Mr Creeger said.
The final investment decisions on APLNG and Ichthys will follow two LNG projects sanctioned in Queensland in the past three months, by BG Group and Santos, worth a combined $31 billion.
They are among a $220 billion line-up of proposed LNG ventures in Australia, not all of which are expected to proceed amid intensifying competition to attract customers.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"BG Group has finalised a supply agreement with Tokyo Gas worth up to $20 billion for its Queensland Curtis Island project, the first deal with Japan for coal-seam liquefied natural gas.
``Tokyo Gas is now an important foundation customer for our ground-breaking Queensland Curtis LNG project,'' chief executive Frank Chapman said.
 ``With these agreements we will bring a new source of natural gas to Japan -- the largest LNG market -- and advance the long and rewarding relationship between our companies.''
The deal, announced in March last year, is for the annual supply of 1.2 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas for 20 years from 2015. The LNG will be sourced from Surat Basin coal.
BG Group Australian head Catherine Tanna and global LNG managing director Martin Houston were yesterday joined in Brisbane by Tokyo Gas president Tsuyoshi Okamoto to finalise the agreement.
It was the first time a Japanese buyer had committed to a long-term purchase of LNG produced from an unconventional source such as coal-seam or shale gas, Tokyo Gas said.
``Tokyo Gas will be supplied with LNG from QCLNG and also from the BG Group's global LNG portfolio, which will bring stable, flexible and competitive supplies of LNG to the company,'' the group said.
The new customer added that its support of the Curtis LNG project would diversify Tokyo Gas's supply to include both rich and lean LNG. It also hinted it would seek additional supply. ``Tokyo Gas will contribute to launch this CSG-LNG project and increase LNG supply capacity by participating as a foundation buyer, and will explore opportunities to receive LNG from various other sources,'' it said.
``The company will continue to secure stable supply of LNG with competitive terms and develop its business in the LNG value chain.''
BG was the first of the big four Gladstone LNG proponents to have its project approved, followed by Santos, which also has approval for construction of a two-train project on Curtis Island.
Mr Chapman flagged last month that the British gas giant was already marketing gas from a $5 billion third production train, as it looked to expand its two-train operation.
The Tokyo Gas agreement adds to QCLNG's list of deals, which lock in about 10 million tonnes of gas a year.
Other contracts include a $60bn deal with China National Offshore Oil Corporation for some 3.6 million tonnes a year over 20 years.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2011,1,"MARK COLVIN: Emotions boiled over on the issue of mining in the New South Wales Hunter Valley today, in a packed hall in the town of Singleton.
The State Government was there to meet the local community. Coal mining in the Hunter has long been a bone of contention but the rapid growth of the coal seam gas industry has significantly upped the ante.
 Representatives of the region's thoroughbred breeding industry, tourism operators, wine growers and landowners turned out in force. Some called for a moratorium on what they labelled an offensive industry.
Barbara Miller was at the meeting for PM.
BARBARA MILLER: The New South Wales Labor Government could only have a few more weeks in office but that didn't stop hundreds of people turning out in Singleton to voice their concerns about mining expansion to the current Planning Minister.
SINGLETON LOCAL: It really is an offensive industry. I believe in the Upper Hunter we are rejecting the expansion of this industry.
(Cheers)
BARBARA MILLER: The impact of the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process used to extract gas from the coal seam has many worried, particularly in communities such as Broke, Putty and Gloucester where exploration is taking place.
BROKE LOCAL: Can't you give us back our rights? We need something too you know. We have been on these lands and properties, running them for years, toiling hard, working, keeping people fed....
(Applause)
BARBARA MILLER: Concerns in Queensland about coal seam gas and recent publicity around the industry are all fuelling fears. Warrick Jordan is campaigns manager with The Wilderness Society Newcastle.
WARRICK JORDAN: Basically what's happening is a giant experiment with the waterways and the communities of New South Wales.
BARBARA MILLER: The Hunter Valley Thoroughbred Breeders have been hosting screenings of the US documentary Gasland. Helen Georgopoulos is the association's director of policy.
HELEN GEORGOPOULOS: We're currently surrounded by mines. We can't coexist any longer.
BARBARA MILLER: Isn't that the same as saying we want an end to mining in the Hunter?
HELEN GEORGOPOULOS: No, it's saying that mining has a place but so do agricultural assets and we have to make a choice about where mining can and can't occur and whether we want to sacrifice one industry for another.
BARBARA MILLER: Di Gee a fifth generation dairy farmer became emotional as she described how one of her children had been ill for a long time. She thinks because of the coal mines in the area.
DI GEE: I can't do any more for her and here you guys are replacing coal and gas strategies (phonetic). I feel that the Government has raped our valley of what was once beautiful.

BARBARA MILLER: In Gloucester AGL has recently gained approval for around 100 gas extraction wells. Wendy Fraser, a dairy farmer, says she thinks that's the lesser of two evils.
WENDY FRASER: I do still have my concerns about coal seam gas and that primarily is with what's happening under the ground and the aquifers interfering as a result of the fracking process. It won't affect us as severely as it has in America and perhaps in Queensland where the farmers are more reliant on bore water.
BARBARA MILLER: Wendy Fraser says the impact of coal mining in general worries her greatly.
WENDY FRASER: What I'm trying to say is my concerns for air quality.
BARBARA MILLER: One of the demands of some of the Hunter community is that some areas be out of bounds to any mining. Planning Minister, Tony Kelly.
TONY KELLY: After today we're going back to the Premier to see if there's something we can't do as a result of these forums that we've had and the input that we've been given.
BARBARA MILLER: Do you think it's possible you might commit to ringing off areas?
TONY KELLY: Well that's certainly what we've been requested to do but I'll have that discussion with Cabinet and with the Premier.
BARBARA MILLER: PM contacted AGL and asked for comment on this story. None was forthcoming by the time we went to air. The New South Wales Minerals Council says it's working hard to address the genuine concerns about the scale of growth of the minerals sector and the collective impact of mines, particularly in the Hunter Valley.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"A PUBLIC information meeting in Casino on the coal seam gas industry is expected to generate plenty of interest following reports last week three wells in theregion are leaking amethane gas.
The leaks in piping connections at the top of the ground were discovered in sealed Metgasco wells near Casino, Bentley and Dyraaba.
 The discovery prompted the Environmental Defender's Office to call on the State Government to more closely monitor the drilling programs and the NSW Greens to question industry claims that coal seam gas is a clean energy source.
Greens candidate for Clarence Janet Cavanagh described methane gas as â€˜a potent greenhouse gas' and said it had 72 times more warming potential than carbon dioxide over 20 years.
Metgasco responded by accusing the Greens of creating a fear campaign around gas ahead of the March 26 State election.
Metgasco chief financial officer Glenda McLoughlin said the amount of gas that had escaped from the sites was insignificant and was the equivalent of just 20 per cent of the emissions of one cow in one day.
Casino is at the heart of the emerging coal seam gas industry on the Northern Rivers, with approvals for well drilling at multiple sites around the town, as well as at Shannon Brook, Busbys Flat, Myrtle Creek, Dyraaba, Kyogle, Geneva, Wood-enbong, Urbenville, Duck Creek, Bonalbo, Tunglebung, Tabulam, Coraki, the Border Ranges National Park, Gibberagee State Forest and Banyabba Nature Reserve. Other exploratory wells have been also approved around Lismore and Bexhill.
All up there are 45 approved production wells across the Northern Rivers and about 100 approvals for exploratory drilling.
Metgasco has State Government approval to develop a 30 megawatt gas-fired power station on the southern outskirts of Casino and wants to build a 140kmpipeline from Casino to Ipswich to supply South-East Queensland and possiblyexport gas to Japan and China.
The information meeting will be held at the Casino RSM Club at 6.30pm on Monday and has been organised by the Casino Rotary Club.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"AUSTRALIA'S liquefied natural gas production jumped 6.1 per cent last year, on the back of increasing global demand, which saw the value of exports hit a record $9.5 billion.
LNG production reached 19.8 million tonnes a year, compared with the previous year's 18.6 million tonnes, and the export value rose 24 per cent from $7.6bn, a report by energy economics group EnergyQuest revealed.
 ``The LNG momentum looks set to continue in 2011,'' EnergyQuest chief executive Graeme Bethune said.
``So far this year we have already seen another Gladstone LNG project, GLNG, in central Queensland, reaching sanction and the ConocoPhillips/Origin Energy APLNG project, also situated at Gladstone, reaching major milestones.
``Altogether, there are seven Australasian LNG projects aiming for final investment decisions in 2011, with combined capacity of around 40 million tonnes per annum.''
Mr Bethune said LNG and domestic gas were now close to running at similar levels.
``LNG has changed from being much smaller than domestic production to now running neck and neck, and next year LNG will be bigger than domestic production,'' he said.
The report revealed that Australian natural gas production reached a record 1999 petajoules last year, up 5.1 per cent from the previous year's 1902PJ.
Australian domestic gas production increased 2.7 per cent to a record 1060PJ. Despite the increases in production, the government's carbon tax proposal is set to have an impact on gas-fired electricity generation projects, with the uncertainty stalling the final go-ahead on plans.
``It is interesting that on the LNG side, companies are committing billions of dollars to LNG projects but on the domestic power side nothing is happening at all,'' Mr Bethune said.
``If you have an LNG project, carbon issues still apply to that too, but you are writing up to 20-year contracts, linked to the oil price. There are many plans and approved sites but not much action, partly due to low electricity prices and ongoing and heightened uncertainty about carbon pricing.
``The issues here are whether there will be sufficient progress with climate policy this year to provide the certainty investors need to go ahead and, if not, what the consequences might be of continuing stalled development.''
The results from last year also saw a turnaround in the nation's oil production, which reached 116 million barrels for the year.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"THE boom in coal seam gas production in Queensland is close to turning the state into the second-biggest consumer of gas in the nation, after Western Australia.
As the state's major liquefied natural gas project proponents gear up, Queensland is set to become a massive producer, with the nation's proved and probable reserves of CSG, mostly in Queensland, having soared in 2010 by 9000 petajoules to a total of 35,246 PJ.
 Consultancy firm EnergyQuest estimates an extra processing ``train'' in Western Australia brought a 24 per cent increase in export income, to a record $9.46 billion for the year, up from $7.63 billion in 2009.
Chief executive Graeme Bethune yesterday said total east coast gas production had grown 4.4 per cent in 2010, largely due to record CSG output - with the first LNG from Queensland not due for production until 2015.
He said the increase in CSG demand was driven by new gas-fired power stations, including Origin's Darling Downs operation and Rio Tinto's Yarwun development at Gladstone, coming on stream.
``So far this year, we have already seen another Gladstone LNG project, GLNG, in central Queensland, reaching sanction and the ConocoPhillips/Origin Energy APLNG project, also situated at Gladstone, reaching major milestones,'' Dr Bethune said.

Residents will meet at the Civic Centre at 9.30am before the public forum at 10.30am.
Upper Hunter independent candidate Tim Duddy will address the rally.
The Hunter Valley Protection Alliance said large numbers and a united front would show Mr Kelly residents had strong concerns over coal seam gas mining.
Barrington Gloucester Stroud Preservation Alliance chairman Graeme Healy said residents were angry about the approval of AGL's Gloucester coal seam gas project, entailing about 90 wells, a few days before the government entered the caretaker period before the election.
He said the government had approved the Gloucester gas project, yet knocked back the proposed Wallarah 2 coalmine at Wyong.
The Planning Assessment Commission recommended the approval of both projects.
 It's just political because it's [Wallarah 2] in an area where they want to hold on to marginal seats,  Mr Healy said.
He said it made a mockery of the consultation for the government's strategy.
 You'd think they'd wait on deciding a major project like [Gloucester] until they asked people for their thoughts on the subject they're supposed to be planning for,  Mr Healy said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Oil and gas junior Icon Energy was issued with a speeding ticket on Friday after its shares rose by more than 25 per cent, to 24Â¢ from 19Â¢, amid speculation about its proposed liquefied natural gas sales project with Shantou SinoGas. The Gold Coast-based company, which made a loss of $3.75 million for the six months to December 31, plans to drill for coal seam gas in the Nappamerri trough of the Cooper Basin, with estimates of 200 trillion cubic feet of gas in place along with other permits in the Gippsland Basin. In April last year, the energy minnow secured a deal to supply the little known SinoGas Group with 40 million tonnes of LNG over a 20-year period, which propelled Icon's shares to a record high of 65Â¢. Icon values the deal between $23 billion and $32 billion, depending on oil prices at the time of export, although analysts are less bullish about its prospects, citing the company's lack of experience in producing commercial quantities of gas.
  Following a price query from the australian Securities Exchange on Friday, Icon said talks with Shantou are continuing, although the company has not signed an LNG sales agreement due to delays in approving government sign-offs and approvals. Perry Williams

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Resources Daily - Overview
Optimism in commodities is fuelling record investment in supply projects, reflecting Australia's position as a major provider of key resources such as iron ore, coal and natural gas.
 Australia's latest resources boom promises to be bigger and better than those that have gone before, but is not without risks. The gloom pervading the sector during the global financial crisis because of falling demand and prices has rapidly turned to optimism again, driven by emerging markets.
 With China pulling back a degree and the general global uncertainty through the global financial crisis, we definitely saw a parking and reassessment of the position,  said Nigel Hunt, a partner specialising in resources at Mallesons Stephen Jaques in Perth.
 But the strong feeling in this market now is that both at the level of the majors and at the junior end of the market strong demand outlook will be there and people are positioning accordingly. 
Buoying confidence is the scale and pace of urbanisation of China's 1.34 billion-strong population, with India still sitting in the wings.
Renewed faith in the commodities super-cycle is fuelling record investment in supply projects, reflecting Australia's position as a major provider of key resources such as iron ore, coal and, increasingly, natural gas.
Planned capital expenditure in minerals and energy projects in Australia reached a record $132.9 billion at the end of October, up 21 per cent on six months earlier. Huge commitments have been made to new supply ventures, such as BG Group's $US16 billion Queensland Curtis liquefied natural gas project and Rio Tinto's expansion of iron ore export capacity in Western Australia by 60 million tonnes in the next three years.
Energy projects â€“ essentially LNG â€“ account for $92.9 billion of the figure and that will surge again this year on the back of soaring energy demand in China and India and the emergence of new importers such as Thailand and Singapore.
This year the Santos-led GLNG venture in Queensland has committed to spend $US16 billion on the first phase of the venture, while joint investment by Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips in their Queensland LNG project, expected in the next months, could be closer to $US18 billion.
On the north-west coast, Shell, Chevron, Woodside Petroleum and Inpex are all targeting go-aheads this year for new LNG projects, potentially totalling a staggering $60 billion more of investment.
BHP Billiton last month revealed a jaw-dropping $US80 billion capex budget on growth projects in the next five years, much of which will be spent in Australia. The budget will include the first stages of the massive Olympic Dam expansion, major enlargements of the iron ore business in WA and the coking coal business in Queensland and more than $US15 billion in oil and gas.
China accounted for about a third of BHP's record half-year revenues of $34 billion and helped, along with higher prices, drive a $US10.5 billion first-half profit for the mining giant.
China is in effect underwriting much of the LNG expansion both in Queensland and in WA through gas purchase contracts, and is also active at the smaller end of the resources industry, encouraging new juniors into the market as it seeks to diversify supplies away from the majors.
Chinese funding sources are also coming to the fore, particularly for smaller companies, often tied to customer contracts.  We are seeing at the moment in the industry an increased appetite for companies to go and seek finance in Asia, and in China in particular and that will tie in with the market for the product,  says Dan Kirk, another Mallesons Stephen Jaques partner in Perth.
Predictably, the boom is not without its downsides. Expected shortages of skilled labour and constraints on engineering and construction resources look set to plague new projects that are already struggling with increasing wages and budget overruns.
The strength of the Australian dollar is hampering some exports while mining tax proposals are affecting sentiment among investors and financiers.
Constraints on key infrastructure such as ports and rail networks also loom, despite renewed involvement by government to facilitate multi-user facilities that offer smaller projects access to export markets.
Arguably, the latest resources boom took off in the second half of 2010, after a first half dominated by the uncertain global economic environment, European sovereign debt concerns, and the shock announcement of the Resources Super Profits Tax plan.
The revision of the mining tax and expectations of an early implementation of a second round of quantitative easing in the US prompted resources stocks to claw back all the first-half's 11 per cent drop and more, ending the year 9 per cent up, UBS says. 2011 continued where the second half left off, with the resources sector racing ahead, despite devastating floods in eastern Australia.
Australia's earnings from mineral resources exports are set to jump 16 per cent to $215 billion next year after this year's expected 34 per cent surge, driven by coal and iron ore. And it's no short-term spike. The latest forecasts for export earnings out to 2015-16 include a more than doubling in LNG revenues, a 92 per cent surge in iron ore export earnings to $68 billion and a 54 per cent jump in coal earnings to $57.6 billion.
Higher prices as well as robust demand have contributed, with copper prices up almost 40 per cent in the past year, aluminium up 40-50 per cent, uranium up 70 per cent and Brent crude up 46 per cent. Contract prices for iron ore, thermal and metallurgical coal have risen strongly in the past two years, with a switch to quarterly contract pricing allowing miners to enjoy near-market clearing prices and boosting Australia's terms of trade.
While some analysts are warning of increased volatility in prices the fundamentals for many key commodities remain solid well into the future. The price for iron ore, where contract rates were down near $US70 a tonne at the start of last year, should average above $US150 a tonne for the next three years and above $US70 through 2020, Macquarie says.
The effect of the boom goes well beyond miners and energy suppliers, to many global companies in supporting industries.
 Australia is caught in this uptake of emerging markets and it's well positioned geographically and historically to take advantage of that,  says Joe Hogan, chief executive of Swiss-Swedish power and automation giant ABB.
Just in mining, about $100 billion of projects are under way in Australia, with another $250 billion or so pencilled in over the next 10 years, notes Axel Kuhr, ABB's manager for Australia.
 Even if only half of that comes through there is so much electrification to be done there will be business for us,  he says.
The global financial crisis just accelerated the trend towards faster growth in Asia and the slowdown in maturing markets in North America and Europe, says Wolfgang Reitzle, Munich-based chief executive officer of engineering company and industrial gases supplier Linde Group.
 Asia is growing faster than we could ever foresee,  Dr Reitzle said.  The world changed after that severe crisis and it's obvious that this mega-shift towards the east is leading to lower growth in North America and Europe and faster growth in Asia. 
Despite an easing in China's expansion since late 2009 and early 2010, growth is still seen running close to 10 per cent this year.
The Australian government's commodities forecaster expects it to average 8.5 per cent through 2015, while warning of the risk of a sharper slowdown on more severe fiscal and monetary tightening.
But the rest of non-OECD Asia is also robust, with the region growing at over 8 per cent a year. The growth expectations have driven a huge rise in mining investment expectations for 2011-12, reflecting the bottom-up numbers on individual project plans.
The mining sector dominates the figures for private sector capex, accounting for 57 per cent of all private investment next fiscal year. The figures have exacerbated fears about constraints that would strangle growth and drive up prices.
 The ability of firms to realise this massive increase may be hampered by capacity bottlenecks, with commensurate implications for price pressures,  Deutsche Bank says, pointing also to  robust  wages growth in the December quarter. Of prime concern is the surge in prices and costs throughout the mining sector since the recovery has taken root, with Wall Street research firm Sanford Bernstein warning of a return to the pre-GFC inflationary pattern.
Australia is perhaps more vulnerable than most countries to budget blowouts, at least judging by its track record on project delivery.
Macquarie Equities notes that of 15 resources projects over $2 billion sanctioned in Australia since 2000, only one, ConocoPhillips' Darwin LNG venture, was delivered on time and budget, with the rest coming in on average 32 per cent more expensive and eight months late.

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2011,1,"While Parliament house in Brisbane witnessed the frustration of Tara Residential Estate residents first hand on Monday, the protests will move back to the estates next week.
Anti coal seam gas protesters are planning to blockade any further work by gas company QGC across the region.
 QGC is planning to begin the installation of 16 kilometres of pipeline, ranging from 16 to 31.5 centimetres in diameter to take gas and water from five gas wells to QGC's Kenya facility approximately 24kms north of Tara in the coming weeks.
However, Friends of the Earth spokesperson Drew Hutton said the expansion would devastate the estates.
â€œWe will be blockading them,â€? he said.
â€œTo access the estates they have to cross Wiembilla Road and we will be there.â€?
Mr Hutton said be connecting these wells to the main hub QGC was hoping to expand their gas presence.
â€œTheir plan is to eat out the heart of the estate.â€?
However, QGC stated that of the land that work will occur on almost half is owned by QGC, while the 14 landholders who's properties will be affected have agreed to compensation packages for the disturbance and have been fully informed about the project.
Mr Hutton said the Brisbane protest had received a great deal of support including confirmation of an additional 40 people from Brisbane who would be assisting with the blockade.
The area is already home to a large amount of gas infrastructure, including the Roma-to-Brisbane pipeline and the Braemer pipeline that supplies gas to the Braemer power station.
Meanwhile QGC signed a 20 year sales contract with Tokyo Gas to buy 1.2 million tonnes of gas annually from 2015.
The deal comes on the back of APLNG announcing an agreement with Chinese Petrochemicals last week.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"The Sunrise treaty with Australia could be at risk
EAST Timor is threatening to cancel its historic treaty with Australia covering the Greater Sunrise liquefied natural gas development unless the Woodside Petroleum-led venture agrees to local processing.
 Woodside's $14 billion Sunrise development proposal is already deadlocked by East Timor's rejection of its floating LNG processing plant, but chief petroleum negotiator Francisco da Costa Monteiro has raised the stakes.
He told The Australian East Timor would seriously consider terminating the treaty at first opportunity, February 2013, if the dispute remained unresolved.
Mr Monteiro said the Dili government would take into account ``all consequences'' of ensuring Sunrise gas was piped to East Timor, ``even be it a breaking up of the treaty''.
``Any treaty must ensure the two sides are happy, but at the moment Timor Leste is not happy and I speak not just as a commissioner but for all Timor Leste citizens,'' said Mr Monteiro, who represents his government on the Sunrise Commission, the joint Australia-Timor regulatory body.
The Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea runs 50 years from February 2007, but either country can terminate in February 2013 if there is still no development approval.
The treaty resolved the problem that 80 per cent of the field was under Australian jurisdiction, although disputed by its tiny neighbour, by dividing gas and condensate royalties 50:50.
East Timor gets a 90:10 royalty split in the Joint Petroleum Development Area, which covers 20 per cent of Sunrise.
Overturning the treaty would return Greater Sunrise to first-base negotiations and reopen the longstanding boundary dispute, frozen by the treaty until 2057.
Woodside, which holds 33.4 per cent of the field, estimates the resource at 5.13 million cubic feet gas and 226 million barrels of condensate.
ConocoPhillips has 30 per cent, Shell 26.6 per cent and Osaka Gas 10 per cent.
The December Sunrise Commission meeting broke down when East Timor asked for suspension of consideration of Woodside's proposals while rights over the ``downstream'' project were clarified.
Dili appears to be pressing Canberra -- which has refused to intervene on commercial considerations -- to take a direct role in negotiations.
East Timor wants the gas piped to Beacu on the south coast, where an LNG plant would anchor the government's ambitious southern industrialisation plan.
Woodside argues the Timor option would cost $5bn extra, while floating LNG would maximise benefits it estimates at $US13bn ($12.9bn) to East Timor over the project's life, and $US19bn to Australia.
It argues a pipeline across the deep Timor Trench is ``technically feasible'' but poses ``technical, operational and commercial difficulties''.
Woodside's largest objection is additional financing cost -- a suggested 6 per cent risk premium -- associated with a project in a country that has never had such development.
Secretary of State for Natural Resources Alfredo Pires said he had best industry advice there were no outstanding technical difficulties with the pipeline.
East Timor had other serious issues with Woodside's project shaping. ``But should everyone align with the Timor Leste LNG option, then we are ready to move yesterday,'' he said.
``We feel that one pipeline (from Bayu-Undan) has gone

already to Australia and has provided a number of benefits to the people of Australia, particularly Darwin, and it is only fair that the next one does the same things for the people of Timor Leste.''
While the dispute continued, he said, East Timor would spend up to 18 months on studies establishing that Timor LNG was viable and commercial.
Mr Pires questioned the operational viability of floating LNG, developed by Shell -- which was still to launch its first FLNG project, Prelude off WA -- and an ``extraordinary'' reduction in the gas resource estimate from 7tcf to 5.1tcf.
Mr Pires criticised Woodside chief executive Don Voelte, who retires this year, claiming other partners told him they also were unhappy with his ``arrogance''.
``So we look forward to discussing Greater Sunrise with the next chief executive of Woodside . . . I think his level of frustration has just got the better of him now.''
A Woodside spokeswoman declined to comment. However, she pointed to a February 21 presentation by Mr Voelte indicating that FLNG was unanimously endorsed by the partners, met all treaty obligations and Woodside was ``driving forward'' to a final investment decision.
Speaking afterwards, however, Mr Voelte evinced impatience with approval problems and said Woodside had other, unspecified options.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"But for this to happen, governments must ensure helpful policies
WOODSIDE Petroleum chief executive Don Voelte says Australia is ready to emerge as a global superpower of the liquefied natural gas industry, leapfrogging key rivals that are plagued by political instability and a dearth of fresh supplies.
 In a bullish assessment of the LNG market as he prepares to step down as chief after seven years, Mr Voelte said Australia would capitalise on problems in rival markets if governments ensured favourable policy settings.
His comments, in an interview yesterday with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, come as more than a dozen LNG projects representing more than $200 billion in investment are either under construction or proposed in Australia.
Mr Voelte dismissed as ``naysayers'' those who believed LNG markets would be oversupplied for some time.
He said no new LNG plants had been built in Russia since Shell's investment in the Sakhalin project in the 1990s, Iran had ``basically shut down'' and Nigeria was beset by civil unrest that deterred foreign investment.
Yemen and Oman had ``run out of gas'' and Malaysia and Indonesia had come to ``the end of the road''.
He said a decision by Qatar, the world's biggest LNG exporter, to place a moratorium on expanding its exports until 2013 meant there would be no new production there for at least 10 years.
``It's all about Australia,'' Mr Voelte said.
``The key fact is nobody is building LNG plants around the world for various reasons: everything from political tensions to just not having any gas left.''
UBS Securities energy analyst Gordon Ramsay said Australia was likely to prosper and one reason was that LNG buyers were looking for diversity of supply.
Australia was attractive to buyers because of political stability and lack of sovereign risk.
Mr Voelte warned also about the fragile economics of major LNG projects, saying this meant the industry had to ensure it managed risks to avoid cost blowouts and delays.
Woodside's $14bn Pluto project in Western Australia has already been hit by cost blowouts of about $2bn and the timetable has been pushed out by nine months.
Mr Voelte said future risks included worsening labour shortages, the industrial relations climate and the federal government's plan to introduce a carbon tax.
``If Australia gets a reputation that they can't carry these projects off, these type of reputation issues can really damage an industry very quickly,'' he said. ``Because we're talking tens of billions of dollars of investment; these aren't hundreds of millions of dollars.
``It's amazing how large these project costs are and how marginal the economics can get.''
In a separate announcement late yesterday, Woodside said Mr Voelte, who will retire later this year, had sold 10 per cent of his shares in the company.
Mr Voelte sold his shares at $43.078, valuing his share sale at about $1.7 million.
Mr Voelte donated the proceeds to nanotechnology research at the University of Nebraska.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"THE Basin Sustainability Alliance (BSA) has released a web-based calculator to allow landholders to understand how gasfield developments may impact on their property.
BSA chairman Ian Hayllor said the calculator was a way to communicate the seriousness of coal seam gas (CSG) developments to landholders.
  Many landholders who have CSG tenures over their land are unsure what it really means to them and are looking for information,  Mr Hayllor said.
The calculator can be found at www.basinsustainability[http://www.basinsustainability] alliance.org
The calculator uses average and minimum well density spacings of the different companies from their conceptual gasfield development plans and calculates the number of CSG wells which the company could consider for an area of land. It also provides an estimate of the area that would be used for gravelled roadways.
The full implications of a CSG company's desk-top planning is contained in their environmental management plans that are lodged when they apply for their Environmental Authority. However, CSG companies are not required to notify individual affected landholders of their plans.
Rather the onus is on the landholder to watch the public notices section of newspapers, seek out the application and raise their concerns through a submission process, he said.
Mr Hayllor said CSG companies must consult with landholders and this consultation was the landholder's key opportunity to make sure that impacts are minimised and unreasonable interference avoided.
 The calculator is just a start at considering the possible gasfield footprint,  Mr Hayllor said.
 It does not take into account gathering lines (water and gas), pipelines (water and gas), electricity lines, compressor stations, above ground signage, surface venting infrastructure and holding ponds. These will all be additional interference. 
 Landholders cannot refuse access unless they have a reasonable excuse for doing so,  he said.
The user enters their property size and chooses the CSG company from the major company list of Arrow, Origin, QGC and Santos then runs the calculator, he said. There is also an 'other company' drop-down box allowing the user to enter the different gasfield variables from the company's environmental management plans.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Woodside Petroleum has approached Japanese industrial giants Mitsubishi and Mitsui to buy a stake in the $35 billion Woodside-led Browse Basin liquefied natural gas project, potentially giving reluctant partner BHP Billiton an exit strategy.
West Australian Premier Colin Barnett told The Australian Financial Review from Tokyo yesterday the heads of the two major Japanese trading houses â€“ Mitsubishi president Ken Kobayashi and Mitsui president Masami Iijima â€“ had expressed their desire to get a foothold in the project when he met them on Tuesday.
  Mitsui and Mitsubishi are looking at further investment in natural gas projects and that might include the Browse,  he said.  That could be via buying out the stake of one of the current partners, or one of those partners diluting their ownership â€“ there was some discussion about that. 
Mr Barnett is on an eight-day tour of Japan and Korea.
But the Financial Review has learned that Woodside started approaching a range of Japanese companies around six months ago including Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo.
It remains unclear if Woodside was gauging interest in selling down its own 50 per cent stake or was inquiring on behalf of its partners in Browse, which include international energy giants Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and BHP Billiton.
BHP and Shell hold concerns over Woodside's and the government's plans to process Browse through a new LNG plant north of Broome, instead of piping the gas south to back-fill gas supplies into the North-West Shelf LNG plant.
Adding to intrigue around the composition of the Browse venture, Shell sold 10 per cent of its stake in Woodside in November. There is now speculation BHP could be in the frame to buy Shell's remaining 24 per cent holding and move on Woodside to increase its domestic oil and gas exposure.
But sources close to the company said Woodside was still the most likely party to dilute its equity in Browse given the large capital expenditure commitment the project will require.
 BHP and Shell may have made some noise about the Browse venture but given it is in its early stages and Woodside has a new chief executive coming on board this year, neither are likely to seek an exit at this stage,  a source close to the project said.  Woodside, however, could do with extra equity partners. 
Mitsui and Mitsubishi already have a long-standing joint venture in WA's gas industry known as MIMI. It was established by the companies in 1985 to manage principally their one-sixth interest in the North-West Shelf venture. The two trading houses have started to face competition from Japanese utilities including Osaka Gas, Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power who all took stakes in Chevron's $43 billion Gorgon LNG project which is under construction.
Mitsubishi has been chasing other energy investments in Australia and is expected to shortly confirm it will take a stake in Santos' $US16 billion GLNG project in Queensland.
Mitsubishi holds an alliance with Korea Gas Corporation, the world's largest LNG buyer, which is poised to sell on part of its 15 per cent stake in the planned project to a Japanese or Korean partner. Woodside is understood to have also been seeking buyers for LNG offtake from the Browse project along with an equity stake since early last year, although Mitsubishi and Mitsui's potential stakes are not thought to be tied to a gas contract.
However, potential buyers have been put off due to concerns over native title issues and ongoing friction within the Browse venture. A spokesman for Mitsui said the company was interested in committing to new ventures in Australia but it could not comment on investment in specific projects. Mitsubishi, Woodside and BHP declined to comment while Shell was unavailable for comment.
The Woodside-operated project, which will deliver 12 million tonnes a year of LNG from the Browse Basin in WA, is due for a final investment decision by the joint venture partners in mid 2012 with a 2017 start-up likely.
Along with the 90 per cent-owned Pluto LNG development which Woodside plans to start up by the middle of this year, Browse represents its largest planned oil and gas investment.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2011,1,"A NEW coal seam gas drilling site near Gloucester in the Hunter Valley will use controversial  fracking  techniques to extract gas, but not some of the more notorious chemicals that have been associated with water pollution.
A proposal by AGL to build up to 110 gas extraction wells and a pipeline received state government approval two days before it went into caretaker mode for the election.
 The plan was discussed at a public meeting in Singleton yesterday which the Planning Minister, Tony Kelly, attended.
Residents told the Herald they were angry that the coal seam gas project could pollute rivers and aquifers and also that the presence of gas wells every few hundred metres would destroy the character of the rural valley. The pipeline to transport methane crosses 201 properties.
 There is significant doubt within the community that existing laws and regulations are suitable to manage the potential impacts of [coal seam gas],  Tim Duddy, a farmer from the Liverpool Plains who is standing as an independent candidate in the election, said.
 That message should have hit home with the government by now. Instead we've got a secretive, last-minute approval. The community was kept in the dark about the approval for a week after the decision. 
AGL said BTEX, one of the more notorious chemical combinations associated with water pollution during fracking, would not be used.
The government would be advised which chemicals would be used before fracking took place.
Fracking involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals deep underground to force gas to the surface. The process has been criticised in the US, where fracking chemicals have found their way into water supplies.
 AGL acknowledges that local people have legitimate questions ... about an industry which is new to many of them, including the process of fracturing the coal seam,  an AGL spokesman said.
 The process involves injecting a fluid made up 99.5 per cent of sand and water, with the other 0.5 per cent being a tiny quantity of highly diluted benign additives typically found in household products such as shampoo and detergents ... The fluid is recovered through the dewatering process and transported to lined holding dams for treatment. 
The company was not able to say when drilling would begin on the Gloucester project, but said it would notify people in advance.
The NSW Greens are calling for a moratorium on any further coal seam gas projects until a public inquiry has investigated the safety and likely long-term effects of the industry's expansion in NSW.

 Bearing in mind KOGAS is the world's biggest buyer of natural gas so South Korea and WA are taking a big step forward in our economic relationships,  Mr Barnett told Fairfax Radio.
During the 1990s, the premier said, South Korea had difficulty in accessing gas sales from the North West Shelf project due to Japanese consumers dominating the the market.
But that has now changed.
 So Korea has been able to buy some gas but now they're looking to buy large amounts of gas,  Mr Barnett.
 I think 1.5 million tonnes has already been committed from the Gorgon project and a smaller amount from the Wheatstone (field) in the future.
 They're also looking at taking up a 15 per cent equity in Wheatstone. 
Mr Barnett said South Korea depended entirely on imported gas and in light of the unrest in northern Africa and the Middle East, the issue of energy supply was a concern for them.
Outside the issue of gas, the premier said South Korea steel producer POSCO has signalled it may increase its involvement in the Oakajee port and rail project and Sandfire Resources' DeGrussa copper-gold project.
 I think we are going to see a bigger Korean presence in WA,  he said.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"MACMAHON SYDNEY, March 11 AAP - Macmahon Holdings Ltd says it has been awarded a $150 million Gladstone LNG (GLNG) civil works subcontract in Queensland.
The subcontract involves the site preparation for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and includes clearing, bulk earthworks, pavements, roads and drainage for a 144 hectare greenfield site on the south west side of Curtis Island near Gladstone.
 The company was awarded the subcontract by Bechtel Australia Pty Ltd and the two parties will now work to finalise contract terms and conditions during the mobilisation phase.
Macmahon chief executive officer Nick Bowen said the contract award was an  excellent win  for the construction business.
 This project award highlights the strength and diversity of the services Macmahon is able to deliver to its broad base of clients and sees the company making a significant return to the rapidly growing LNG sector,  he said in a statement.
The GLNG project, a joint venture between Santos, PETRONAS, Total and KOGAS, will process coal seam gas (CSG) into LNG.
Macmahon's work on the project will start immediately and is scheduled for completion in late 2012.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2011,1,"Our say
The new era of Queensland's energy industry begins next week, with the laying of the first pipes of QGC's $14 billion gas project which will extract coal seam gas from thousands of wells in the Western Downs and the Surat Basin.
 The gas will then be piped to liquefied natural gas facilities on Curtis Island in Gladstone.
The State government is grinning like a Cheshire Cat over this project, which will prove to be a major cash cow for which ever party is in government in 2014 when the first of the gas is expected to be exported.
But not everyone is happy with the first of the pipes being laid near Tara on Monday.
Landholders, farmers and graziers are concerned about their futures.
Concerns are also being raised about the damage to the Great Artesian Basin through the gas extraction process as well as other environmental concerns.
The State Government imposed many environmental conditions on the original LNG project application.
But protestors from all over the state are planning blockades in the region next week as the project finally gets under way.
Protestors have already gathered at Parliament House this week in relation to the pipeline affecting rural blocks in Tara.
The Government and the gas companies need to be conscious of the uncertainty the gas project is causing in some Surat Basin and Western Downs communities.
Just as the companies and the government spruik about the financial windfalls of this new industry, they also have to keep reassuring those affected that their concerns are being listened to.
Even if the gas companies have put all their ducks in a row, that may not be enough for landholders and residents.
Appearing to do the right thing is just as important as doing the right thing.
The important consideration in this time is the environment, and everyone should remember that.

The liquefied natural gas and coal- seam gas industries are pushing for development with the government of a joint training centre which could help alleviate some of the skills shortages in two of the fastest-growing parts of the economy.
 The centre would offer specialised skills development going beyond the training provided at the Australian Centre for Energy Process Training, which uses federal and state funding to train LNG plant operators.
Industry sources said the LNG and the coal seam gas industries were highly global with specialised skills requirements and therefore relied to some extent on accessing workers and professionals from all over the world.
The Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, which represents the LNG and coal seam gas industries, has been pressing for such a centre to address expected skills shortages as new large resource projects are built and start operating.
The industry has two main requirements: skilled tradespeople and professionals such as engineers in the construction phase of projects, and specialised technical staff once they are operational.
Companies, including Santos, Arrow and Origin Energy, are providing assistance to students for skilled training and professional study to improve career opportunities in the new coal seam gas sector.
This includes a pilot program for school-based training in Queensland to develop an entry-level training course and in-house training for the coal seam gas sector.
The federal cabinet is considering whether to undertake a radical overhaul of skills subsidies by limiting training funding to specific industries.
It has examined options to address skills shortages and manage the two-speed economy as a result of the resources boom, including its response to the Resources Employment Taskforce report.
A massive 72 resources projects worth $132.9 billion are in an advanced state of planning and have contributed to chronic shortages of professionals and skilled trades, including engineers.
The shortages of skilled labour have increased the cost of developing LNG and coal seam gas projects.
The construction industry argues that skills shortages in industries not directly affected by the reÂ­sources boom have been exacerbated by the higher salaries paid by mining companies.
 There is a huge pull from the mining industry taking engineers away from the civil engineering, construction and maintenance sectors. The resources companies are paying very big money to attract them but they are stripping from other sectors,  said Jim Barrett, executive director of the Australian Constructors Association.
This backs up the assessment from Reserve Bank of Australia assistant governor Philip Lowe who has warned that non-resource sector businesses could face an extended period of below-trend growth as cashed up mining companies claim a rising share of the nation's workers and squeeze others out.
Mr Barrett called on the government and industry to work together to build a sustainable workforce. This would require planning to focus on the short, medium and long term requirements of the labour market.
It should examine issues including how to address the shortage of apprentices by trying to bring in adults in their 20s or 30s, Mr Barrett said.
Michael Hartman, chief executive of the Forestry Skills Council, said the impact of the resources sector in attracting skilled workers away from other industries had to be recognised by the government.
 It is not just the industries making a lot of money like the mining sector that need assistance for training,  he said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Woodside Petroleum's initial moves to sell down its stake in the $35 billion Browse liquefied natural gas venture in Western Australia have been welcomed by analysts and investors concerned about its exposure to the expensive and complex project.
Analysts said yesterday they expected Woodside to reduce its stake from about 46 per cent currently to reduce its risk and cut its capital expenditure burden.
 WA Premier Colin Barnett told The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday that the heads of Mitsubishi and Mitsui had voiced a desire to get a foothold in the project.
Mr Barnett said the Japanese trading houses could secure their stakes either by buying out one of the current partners, or by one partner diluting its ownership in the huge venture.
Some of the Browse partners, notably BHP Billiton and Royal Dutch Shell, are known to have concerns about Woodside's plan to develop the project through an onshore LNG plant at an undeveloped site north of Broome, rather than pipe the gas south to the existing North-West Shelf venture's plant at Karratha once its gas fields start to run down.
Still, none of the partners are expected to seek to exit the project before it is more developed.
But illustrating the reluctance of the partners to back the Kimberley LNG plan, Woodside revealed yesterday that it remains the only member of the Browse venture to have formally approved the start of initial engineering work on the project.
The decision to start the work was due early this year.
The partners, which include BP and Chevron, have approved $779 million of spending for the venture in 2011, Woodside chief executive Don Voelte said last month.
Most of that would be on the engineering work, with more to come next year ahead of a final investment decision in mid-2012.
Macquarie Equities oil and gas analyst Adrian Wood said it should be no surprise that Woodside is looking to sell down its stake in Browse.
 When I run the numbers, if they are really going to keep 46-50 per cent of this project they would need an enormous capital raising,  Mr Wood said.
 And not only that but the stock would become almost un-investable, given our concerns about project cost inflation,  he said, pointing to the technical complexity of the project, high levels of carbon dioxide in the Browse gas and its remote location.
Selling stakes to Mitsui and Mitsubishi would align the membership of the Browse project with the North-West Shelf venture and would, in theory, ease the way to processing the gas at Karratha instead of at the James Price Point site near Broome.
But Citigroup calculates that Woodside's hefty stake in the project means the James Price Point option offers far superior net present value for the company even if it cut its stake.
KEY POINTS Analysts said Woodside aimed to cut its capital expenditure burden by reducing its stake in the Browse venture. Japanese giants Mitsubishi and Mitsui are looking to acquire a stake of the liquefied natural gas project.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2011,1,"ELIZABETH JACKSON: A devastating tsunami triggered by the biggest earthquake on record in Japan has killed at least 350 people, but it's feared the final death toll will be much higher. The quake measured 8.9 and the tsunami that reached the land was 10 metres high in some places.
Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of black water after the quake struck north-east of Tokyo. A dam has burst, a train derailed and another is missing.
 A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels. In one area alone in Sendai, between 200 and 300 bodies were found.
In the centre of Tokyo many people have spent the night in their offices, others chose to walk home if they could get there. Amidst a series of aftershocks, earlier this morning there was another strong quake of 6.6-magnitude in Japan's mountainous Niigata prefecture in the west of the main Honshu island.
In the north-east, Japan's army has been deployed, and the Japanese Government has asked the US military based in the country for help. The scale of the destruction will only become clear at first light this morning.
According to scientists, the quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, last month.
Saturday AM's Paula Kruger prepared this report.
PAULA KRUGER: There are still only snippets of information coming through on what was left behind by the wave of destruction that swept through Sendai. Reports coming from police on the ground at a beachside suburb there say between 200 and 300 bodies have been found.
So far the number of fatalities is at 350, 500 people are missing but Japanese media is predicting that gruesome figure could rise to above 1000.
A witness, Suneel, was driving through the city of port city of Nagato, about 250 kilometres from Sendai, when the massive earthquake struck.
SUNEEL: When it first happened, you know, obviously we didn't know, I didn't know and it wasn't until the last few hours that the scale, when people started seeing this just unbelievable footage of tsunamis just rolling in over landscape on the Pacific side.
That's when it started to hit people. Just, I think what, the scale of the disaster, and I think it's really just going to start the turn very quickly, just into a kind of a mourning situation. Maybe the likes of which the country probably hasn't seen since Kobe.
PAULA KRUGER: Aftershocks have continued throughout the night. Alexander, a lawyer working in Tokyo, is speaking here from his apartment.
ALEXANDER: Actually, as we're speaking right now, there is an aftershock that is happening. My building is shaking again and it's actually quite scary because this has been happening for probably every 10, 15 minutes. And I live on the 36th floor so the shaking appears pretty violent.
PAULA KRUGER: Tee-air Kobiyashi was in her 8th floor apartment in the centre of Tokyo when the main earthquake struck.
TEE-AIR KOBIYASHI: I went under the desk, that's what we are told when an earthquake happens, we should go under the desk to protect ourselves from it.
I did, and still the desk, the whole desk was shaking. So I held the leg of that desk and I was thinking, finally that this quake is hitting Tokyo. We've been talking about this for years and I thought this is the day that it finally came.
It really felt like a long time, I was kind of praying, please, stop now, please stop now, but it went for me, I felt like it lasted for 10 minutes or something. I'm sure it was much, much shorter.
PAULA KRUGER: In Sendai there are also reports of a major explosion at a petrochemical complex. Fire has also engulfed a large waterfront area in Kesennuma city in the Miyagi prefecture.
A fire at a turbine plant building of the Onagawa nuclear plant in Miyagi has been brought under control. All the nation's nuclear power plants were automatically shut down yesterday when the earthquake struck.
The Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan says disaster operations are underway.
NAOTO KAN (translated): We have created an office to deal with the disaster, maintain the safety of everyone and we'll look to reduce the amount of damage to the smallest possible amount.
PAULA KRUGER: There were initially concerns the tsunami could sweep through the Pacific.
Gerard Fryer is from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. Authorities there ordered everyone to clear the beaches.
GERARD FRYER: Hawaii was pretty severely hammered by waves. The town of Kahului on Maui for example, there were waves almost three metres high came in, flooded a hotel and swept inland a third of a mile.
We have a restaurant severely damaged by boats. There is scattered reports now of damage from all around the islands. There is absolutely no question that if we had not issued a warning for Hawaii, then people would have died.
ELIZABETH JACKSON: That's Gerard Fryer from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii ending that report from Paula Kruger.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"A DIPLOMATIC darkness continues to set firm on Woodside Petroleum's plans to invest upwards of $14 billion on the novel Greater Sunrise liquefied natural gas project, with East Timor this week threatening to walk away from the international treaty that apportions sovereignty over the petroleum territory it shares with Australia.
On the same day the market got first sight of Woodside's Tokyo-option for progress on another of its contentious projects, the Browse development on the North West Shelf of WA, The Australian reported that East Timor would abandon the royalty sharing treaty with Australia rather than accept Woodside's proposal to build a floating LNG processing plant on top of Greater Sunrise.
 The treaty in question is called CMATS (or the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea . . . no I am not kidding!) and it sets the rules by which development of Greater Sunrise can proceed and enshrines a 50-50 split between Australia and East Timor on royalty flows.
Under the terms of CMATS, East Timor can conclude the treaty as early as February 2013. And that, according to our near neighbour's chief negotiator, Francisco da Costa Monteiro, is exactly what it will do if Woodside continues to ignore Dili's development preferences.
The reality here is that Monteiro and just about anyone else involved in East Timor's Greater Sunrise negotiations have seen and heard all they want to from Woodside's current boss, Don Voelte.
They know Voelte is leaving and they are patently attempting to filibuster the Greater Sunrise process in the hope that his replacement might be more amenable to their ideas of the way forward for the project and, barring that, that they might be able to lure the federal government into more active engagement in the current dispute.
The issue before Woodside and our federal government is that East Timor wants the Greater Sunrise gas landed and processed on its south coast at a spot called Beacu.
Woodside says that option would add at least $5bn to the cost of a project and it would increase the overall project risk because it would require the construction of a pipeline across
Continued on Page 40
Continued from Page 25
the Timor Trench and the construction and operation of an LNG facility in a country poor in both infrastructure and skilled labour.
The federal government, at least so far, is sticking to its mantra, which is that the operator of the Greater Sunrise lease, Woodside, should be free to proceed with the most commercially sensible option, as proscribed by the CMATS arrangements.
According to Woodside, landing gas in East Timor would sit at the very edge of pipeline technology both in its construction and operation. But East Timor is insisting that it must be done.
The root of the problem here is essentially topographical. The Greater Sunrise fields were discovered in the Timor Sea by Woodside in 1974 and within 12 months Indonesia had invaded East Timor.
Two subsequent agreements over the sovereignty of the waters of the Timor Sea, the first with Indonesia, the second with East Timor, have left Greater Sunrise straddling Australian territory and what is now called the Joint Petroleum Development Area.
The JPDA was affirmed in 2002 by the Timor Sea Treaty and its effect is that East Timor gets 90 per cent of any royalties that flow from petroleum production in the zone. But the real irritation right now is that the combination of the CMATS and JPDA treaties leaves East Timor with a call over Woodside's options that is quite disproportionate to its actual entitlement to the Greater Sunrise gas.
In the end, only about 20 per cent of the gas sits within the JPDA. The rest is Australian. And the distinction between what gas sits where might well become important as this dispute develops.
Speaking recently about Greater Sunrise, Woodside boss Don Voelte said: ``If we run into a little bit of a brick wall here and we can't get around it or go through it, well, we'll go over it.'' And one way over the wall might be to extract Australia's share of the Greater Sunrise gas and leave East Timor to its own devices. And, to that end, the suspension of the CMATS treaty might come as a blessing in disguise.
Fraser's potash play
AS an investment banker, Chris Fraser worked both sides of the great Pilbara divide, working with Fortescue on the now legendary $2.04 billion debt raising that bought it a real future in iron ore and a year later mulling merger and acquisitions strategies for BHP Billiton.
So, when Fraser quit Citi two years ago to pursue an independent business life as a miner, he walked away with a big idea extracted from each miner.
From his work with BHP he divined his commodity of choice and from Fortescue he adapted a new business model.
This week Fraser completed a pound stg. 20 million ($32m) capital raising that he expects will see Sirius Minerals transformed into an Australian-based, British listed operator of a potash mine just south of picturesque Whitby on the coast of North Yorkshire.
Fraser reckons he has been looking for a pathway to potash since he was introduced to the fertiliser at a series of strategy sessions at BHP in London in 2007.
``Citi were working with BHP's key strategy guy, Alberto Calderon, on complete global M&A review and potash and PSC (Potash of Saskatchewan) just kept floating to the top of the lists.''
(BHP eventually made a $40bn bid for Potash Corp in 2010, only to be blocked from its pursuit by the Canadian government on national interest grounds.)
``Then when I set up my own consultancy business two years ago, I set out to have a really good look at how you might get into potash at the bottom floor,'' Fraser told me yesterday. ``I looked around the sector and about a year ago a geologist came to me and asked, `Do you know there is a potash mine in the UK?' The thing about potash is that it tends to occur fairly broadly. So we looked it up. It is called the Boulby Mine and it is in North Yorkshire. And then we started our own journey.
``We hired the two best people in the UK, including those that actually commissioned Boulby. And then went out and gathered data and then set about collecting mining rights by stealth to ensure that no one else would run up against us.'' These days, in his more buoyant moments, Fraser expresses hopes that he can become the Fortescue of potash. And you only have to look at his board to see why he might be liking his chances of emulating a success that he helped generate at Citi.
After all, Sirius has both a former and a current Fortescue executive on its board. The new force in iron ore, former CFO Chris Catlow, is the chairman of Sirius, while current Fortescue executive director Russell Scrimshaw is a non-executive director of the potash prospector. Both are major shareholders, with Catlow owning 11 per cent of the company and the more recently deployed Scrimshaw 1.4 per cent.
Sirius was set up by Catlow as a vehicle to look for, among other things, potash in Australia and North Dakota. Then along came Fraser and his North Yorkshire option. That project was delivered into Sirius, with Fraser emerging as the senior shareholder of the company, with nearly 13 per cent of the business.
Like Fortescue, Sirius has made good use of exploration work carried out by different arms of what has subsequently become Rio Tinto. Fortescue's initial forays into the Pilbara were guided by CRA's work on tenements that were subsequently surrendered, while the York sulphate of potash deposit that Fraser wants to tap was initially identified in the 1970s by RTZ.
According to Fraser, this particular brand of potash attracts a healthy premium over the more chlorine-heavy muriates of potash that is produced by the Canadian producers that so dominate the global market. Fraser reckons his chunk of Yorkshire contains one of the biggest deposits of sulphate of potash in the world. This might just be a story to watch.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"OPINION & ANALYSIS
IN last Saturday's Newcastle Herald Mike Moraza, the AGL group general manager, upstream gas, wrote that coal seam gas exploration was tightly regulated. He quoted Belinda Robinson, the chief executive officer of the oil and gas industry body APPEA as saying:  Australia's CSG [coal seam gas] is the most carefully scrutinised and heavily regulated in the country .
 This is simply wrong. The coal industry, to name just one, is far more regulated, with stricter rules on exploration and greater scrutiny.
Mr Moraza said environmental assessments had been undertaken for each AGL exploration hole in the Hunter, but did not say that such assessments were superficial, done to a template, not open to community scrutiny, and simply accepted by the department.
Mr Moraza said AGL had agreements with each of the landowners where wells are drilled. As far we know, only one has signed an agreement with AGL; all other wells are on land owned by AGL.
Mr Moraza said AGL had voluntarily conducted groundwater monitoring. But he did not say it was necessary for us to remind AGL of its commitment to conduct that monitoring at a community consultative committee meeting.
Mr Moraza did not say AGL tried to scuttle an important mapping project started by its predecessor, SGL. This was to identify the few areas that were available for exploration under the provisions of the Petroleum (Onshore) Act. Had AGL undertaken this project it would have revealed that more than 70 per cent of the area was unavailable, and many areas available were close to vineyards, dwellings and the village of Broke.
Mr Moraza said that AGL happily complied with regulations and aimed to exceed them. The dumping of saline water by AGL on its property was initially denied and then acknowledged. AGL was served with a notice to remediate. The matter is still under investigation by the Ombudsman.
AGL has downgraded community consultation. When SGL held the licence, their managing director and chairman attended the community consultative committee meeting regularly. For AGL, junior management attends.
Moreover, the committee was summarily dismissed by Steve Whan, the Minister for Primary Industries, without input.
Mr Moraza listed acts of parliament that affect exploration. What he did not say is that these acts do not deliver environmental protection. The Petroleum (Onshore) Act does not mention methane gas and did not envisage CSG. It has no reference to the Environmental Protection or Water Acts. He also failed to acknowledge that Part 3A of the Planning Act enables these acts to be diluted.
Mr Moraza did not address points raised by Andrew Margan (Hunter Valley Wine Industry Association) in the Herald in the week prior.
AGL is not interested in protecting our wine industry, our land values, our ground water and our beautiful valley.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG By Petrina Berry And Jess Marszalek
BRISBANE, March 14 AAP - Protesters say they will put their bodies on the line to save their land and homes from a coal seam gas development northwest of Brisbane.
 Up to 70 protesters have gathered at Tara and say they will form a human blockade to stop Queensland Gas Company workers moving in to build a gas pipeline.
Some have climbed trees near a key access road, holding banners that say:  Don't gas Tara .
Others, including farmers, landowners and green groups, have rallied outside the company's Tara office.
QGC is due to begin work on the 16km pipeline this week. It will take gas from existing wells on QGC and private land to the company's plant nearby.
QGC says almost half of the pipeline will be on its own land, and the 14 landholders directly affected have agreed to compensation packages for disturbance to their properties.
But Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said several affected property owners believed QGC had not been fair or open about its plans.
He said they, and others opposed to the project's development, delivered a letter to QGC on Monday warning the company's workers not to enter the Tara estate.
 We told them it would be a public nuisance and we consider their activity to be illegal,  Mr Hutton told AAP.
He said landowners were concerned QGC intended to build hundreds of gas wells in the area, and were worried about the impact on their health, the environment and land values.
Mines Minister Stirling Hinchliffe warned protesters not to break the law.
 Upholding the law is the way they're going to have their concerns respected and the way that the whole of the community is going to respect their concerns,  he told reporters in Toowoomba on Monday.
 So my advice to anyone in the sort of situation where they feel they have to go to extreme measures to get their voice heard is that protesting is understandable, breaking the law is not. 
Mr Hinchliffe said the government wanted to achieve a workable balance between the interests of residents and the emerging industry.
Controversy surrounds the safety of hydraulic fracturing, also known as fraccing, used to extract gas from the coal seams.
Environmentalists say it is unsafe and a scientist has also raised safety concerns about the chemicals used.
Dr Mariann Lloyd-Smith, an adviser to the federal government's National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), has said QGC's environmental applications contained out-of-date and deficient safety data.
Comment was being sought from QGC.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The devastation in Japan from Friday's earthquake and tsunami will disrupt trade for some time.
Japanese industry is reliant on Australian minerals, coal and liquid natural gas.
 As well, 13 per cent of Australia's agricultural exports go to Japan.
Chief commodity analyst with ABARES, Jamie Penm, says the tragedy is still unfolding and the picture is unclear.
 In the short term, we can see some disruptions but over the medium to longer term, when rebuilding starts, there will be increased demand for commodities, where Australia is a major producing country and Japan is one of our major export destinations. 
The tsunami triggered by the earthquake in Japan swept across highly productive agricultural land.
An agricultural journalist based in Tokyo, Hana Saito, says the vegetable and fruit crops are destroyed.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"A NSW doctor has raised health concerns about the emerging coal seam gas industry.
Dr Helen Redmond, a member of the lobby group Doctors for the Environment, says very little is known about the  fracking  process used to extract the gas and the chemicals used.
 She says the industry isn't declaring what chemicals are going down the wells, but she believes they are highly toxic, and says the government's chemical regulator needs to look into it.
 They include highly toxic substances,  she said.
 There are also chemicals released from the coal seam itself during the depressurizing process, including heavy metals, radioactive components and aromatic hydrocarbons. 
Dr Redmond concedes there aren't yet any proven links between coal seam gas and health problems in the United States or Queensland.
 The studies haven't been done. There are no studies on gas workers, or people exposed to chemicals and air pollution,  she said.
 It's like coal, where massive health effects have emerged over the years, but people don't want to look at this or take those costs into consideration. 
The industry says the chemicals are not a problem because they are used in very small quantities, but Dr Redmond disagrees.
 A typical well requires 18,000 kilos of additives other than water.
 We know from looking at material safety data sheets, included in environmental applications by the companies, that some of these chemicals are a concern.
Dr Redmond says there are short term and medium effects from exposure and not all chemicals are identified by a proper CAS number (CAS is a global registry of chemicals), so that scientific literature can then be traced for health effects.
The industry says the chemicals used in the process are safe, but Dr Redmond says the companies haven't revealed all the chemicals used.
 We know from work done in US that nearly 1,000 different products are used in unconventional gas extraction, including 600 chemical compounds.
 Not all are toxic, but only 300 of the chemicals have been identified and there are massive gaps in our knowledge about what's used. 
She wants the chemical regulator to look into it.
 NICNAS, the chemical regulator in this country, only has information on two of 23 commonly used chemicals, and they haven't been analysed for use in fracking - that body of work hasn't done work. 
The industry will have to submit lists to government authorities under recent changes introduced by the NSW Government.
Dr Redmond says that would go a long way towards analysing the health impacts, but she remains concerned about the lack of studies into the health impacts of this kind of mining.
 Queensland will increase the number of gas wells tenfold in 20 years, and the more wells, the greater the chemical load, and the more they accumulate in the food chain. 
The ABC spoke to AGL Ltd, the company that has just had 110 wells approved in Gloucester.
In a statement, it says its Camden Gas Project in Sydney has been running for the past 10 years without any health impacts at all.
 The process is heavily regulated and involves submitting a review of environmental factors to the Department of Industry and Investment (DII), which also refers the review to the Department of Planning and the Office of Water.
 Future programs will involve submitting a list of all additives intended to be used to the DII in advance.

 DEBRA NOWLAND: Farmers, residents and environmentalists have gathered ready to stop the Queensland Gas Company from coming onto a rural residential estate at Tara. Drew Hutton is the protest organiser and says they're there to stay as long as it takes.

We believe as a Government that we need to be about getting the balance right between landholders' needs and expectations and the development of what is an extraordinarily positive sunrise industry for the state.
My message to the protesters at Tara is that they should make their concerns known and be very clear about that but I encourage them not to break the law.
DEBRA NOWLAND: And debate over whether that balance continues to rage. Some landholders are worried the impact the industry has on water quality and in a statement today, the Queensland Gas Company acknowledged people are anxious about its coal seam gas industry.
The region's field general manager Bruce Coats says it's a minority group and today's protest isn't disrupting operations.
BRUCE COATS: We've got work going on here as I speak I don't think that there is a blockade I haven't seen any evidence of a blockade...
DEBRA NOWLAND: So when did the workers come in?
BRUCE COATS: The workers are coming into our Kenya office and Kenya site...
DEBRA NOWLAND: No this is the other site that rural residential estate that they would also need to get to across the road.
BRUCE COATS: That's some time down the track.
DEBRA NOWLAND: Tara landholder Michael Bretherick isn't satisfied with the company's response and the protest is ongoing.
MICHAEL BRETHERICK: They basically locked us out of the office and said no comment but no one wants to talk to us, no one will comment about their actions about the impacts that we're suffering from so we, they were just pretty arrogant with us.
ELEANOR HALL: That's property owner Michael Bretherick ending that report from Debra Nowland.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The oil and gas producer's new chief financial officer appears sanguine about the challenge of Browse, writes Paul Garvey.
If and when Woodside Petroleum approves its mammoth $35 billion Browse liquefied natural gas development off Western Australia's northern coast, it will be Lawrie Tremaine who will be charged with securing the huge funding package to ensure the project's construction.
 The former Alcoa vice-president of finance in the Asia-Pacific region is only settling into the chief financial officer's role at Woodside, having taken over from Mark Chatterji late last year when the highly respected American number-cruncher decided to return home.
While Woodside's balance sheet will receive a major boost when the $13 billion Pluto LNG project finally comes into production later this year, Woodside's aggressive timetable on Browse means Mr Tremaine's job won't get any easier.
Woodside's share of the Browse development costs â€“ which could be as high as 46 per cent of the final budget â€“ looks set to be the largest financing for a single project by an Australian-listed company.
It may be because Woodside and its partners in Browse are still at least another year away from making a final investment decision, but right now Mr Tremaine appears calm about the challenge awaiting him.
Having assumed the CFO role after a stint as head of treasury at Woodside, he already has a good feel for the challenge that awaits at Browse.
Mr Tremaine is confident that Woodside will increasingly focus on Asia, rather than the United States, as the dominant source of funding for its next major growth project.
Last year, he and Mr Chatterji put a toe in the water with a $US1.1 billion syndicated loan through Asian fixed-income investors, testing the Asian bond and bank markets in the process. The response showed a clear path for Browse's funding.
 We were overwhelmed with the level of support we got there, and we're reassured by the refinancing that that wasn't a one-off and those banks are going to stick with us, Mr Tremaine said.  It's given us the opportunity to open up a dialogue with many more banks, many of them very significant. 
While Woodside and its partners are required by the government to make a final investment decision on Browse by mid-2012, the huge development â€“ planned for a strip of coastline at James Price Point, north of Broome in Western Australia's Kimberley region â€“ has been the subject of much continuing debate.
Most of that centres on the environmental and social dimensions of the project â€“ which is planned for a relatively untouched part of WA where local Aboriginal communities are split over the merits of the development â€“ and the commitment of Woodside's partners to the project.
BHP Billiton has publicly questioned whether piping the Browse gas 1000 kilometres south to the existing North-West Shelf LNG plant is a better option, while both Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell are believed to hold some reservations about Woodside's preferred development.
In Mr Tremaine's view, however, such controversies have failed to put off potential Asian financiers for the project. Rather than focus on the ground-level debate being waged in Australia, Asian financiers are better attuned to the domestic energy demands on their own doorstep.
 It's much, much easier to sell Woodside's story in Asia than anywhere else, because they're the guys who need the energy,  Mr Tremaine said.  They understand they don't have an indigenous energy supply, so they understand how important a company like Woodside is. 
In addition, the strong familiarity between Asian financiers and Woodside's offtake customers should work in Woodside's favour â€“ which Mr Tremaine noticed during last year's Asian syndicated loan.
 Typically, our offtakers are their banking clients, and Woodside particularly has top-tier offtakers with extremely strong credit themselves,  he said.
 The credit teams and the banks would listen to the story, check a few facts, and come to the conclusion that with long-term take or pay contracts, offtakers which are essentially government utilities or in some way tied to governments, [and which are] certainly tied to the national infrastructure of the country, [financing] wasn't a problem. 
Mr Tremaine said he expected Woodside to lock cornerstone offtake customers for Browse ahead of a final investment decision on the project next year.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"POLLNSW SYDNEY, March 15 AAP - The NSW government plans to ban the use of  BTEX  chemicals in the hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - process to extract coal seam gas, if it is re-elected.
Under Labor's 10-point coal and coal seam gas plan announced on Tuesday, Premier Kristina Keneally said the use of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes - BTEX chemicals - would be outlawed across the state.
 The Queensland government late last year banned BTEX fracking, which involves pumping water, sand and those chemicals into a bore site to force gas to the surface.
Speaking in the Hunter Valley, Ms Keneally said the government's plan would not stop the use of fracking technology in NSW, and noted here was no evidence of BTEX fracking being used in the state.
But it would assuage environmental concerns about the chemicals sometimes used in the process.
 There is no evidence to suggest these chemicals are being used in NSW, but ... everything seems to suggest they are carcinogenic,  she told reporters while visiting a vineyard in Millfield.
 They have been banned in other jurisdictions. We think it is appropriate NSW follows suit.

BRISBANE, March 15 AAP - Protesters are preparing for a showdown with gas pipeline workers to stop a major coal seam gas development at Tara west of Brisbane.
 Tara residents, farmers and green groups say they will lock their farm gates if the Queensland Gas Company (QGC) tries to enter properties to lay the pipes.
They also say they're prepared to form a human barricade to stop the work.
But QGC says almost half of the 16km pipeline will be on its own land, and the 14 landholders directly affected have agreed to compensation packages for disturbance to their properties.
So far there has been no showdown between QGC workers and protesters, who began the blockade on Monday.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton told AAP work on the pipeline had started and it was getting closer to the protesters camped on Wieambilla Road - the only road access between the Tara estate and QGC's nearby headquarters.
 That pipeline is working its way across and I expect it'll reach us by tomorrow morning. That's when we expect a showdown,  Mr Hutton said.
 They have to go under Wieambilla Road to put that pipeline on the Tara estate but we're going to do all we can to stop them in a non-violent way. 
He said protesters were in it for the long-haul and camped overnight despite a mice plague in the area.
He said QGC's CSG project involved hundreds of gas wells and hydraulic fracturing and many were concerned about the impact it would have on their health, the environment and land values.
National Lock the Gate Alliance spokesman John Tomson has flown from the Hunter Valley to join the Tara protest.
The alliance formed last year to stop mining companies, in particular CSG miners, from entering people's land.
 In the Hunter Valley we have already seen the destructive impact of open cut coal mining and now the rapid intrusion of coal seam gas mining activities,  Mr Tomson said.
 Wherever we look, the problems are the same - government support for the unfettered, unregulated, rapacious growth of the coal and coal seam gas mining industries.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"POLLNSW SYDNEY, March 15 AAP - With less than two weeks to go in the state election campaign, NSW Premier Kristina Keneally has finally taken sides in the controversy over coal seam gas exploration.
She has chosen to support farmers and environmentalists, announcing restrictions on where miners can explore and how they can extract the gas.
 Speaking in a Hunter Valley vineyard, Ms Keneally announced it would be Labor policy to prohibit exploration near national parks and ban the use of toxic BTEX chemicals in extracting gas.
 There is no evidence to suggest these chemicals are being used in NSW, but everything seems to suggest they are carcinogenic,  she told reporters.
And in a further snub to miners, she said a Labor government would make miners pay more to landowners.
 A re-elected Keneally government will mandate minimum payments to landowners to recognise the business consequences of exploration and extraction activities on farming,  she announced.
Ms Keneally would also conduct an audit of gas wells and drill sites to see how operators had complied with conditions of approval, and appoint an industry ombudsman to investigate complaints.
The new policy is clearly aimed at preventing any leakage of votes to the Greens in the upper house and the threatened inner-Sydney electorates of Balmain and Marrickville.
Meanwhile Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell is promising to revisit two major government projects - the Barangaroo development on Sydney Harbour and the contract for the long-delayed Waratah trains.
Mr O'Farrell said a Liberal-Nationals government would review the Waratah train project, which had seen delivery of new carriages delayed at least 14 months by the private contractor Downer EDI.
He said he wouldn't guarantee the eventual success of the project if he won the March 26 election.
 We're not going to write blank cheques for anybody,  Mr O'Farrell told reporters on Tuesday.
Mr O'Farrell also promised to scrutinise the Barangaroo development project on Sydney Harbour, but seemed doubtful if anything could be changed.
 Should we be elected, we'll have a look at all the arrangements there (at Barangaroo) but we're not going to support inquiries or initiate inquiries if they can't actually initiate a purpose,  he said.
Mr O'Farrell is not quite an unbackable favourite, but odds against a coalition victory on March 26 shortened further on Tuesday, coming in from $1.02 to $1.015 on Sportsbet after several punters bet between $20,000 and $50,000 on what looks increasingly like a sure thing.
Opinion polls have the Coalition headed for a landslide victory, and Mr O'Farrell will no doubt be further pleased by a poll on voters' reaction to the federal government's carbon tax, which he opposes and Ms Keneally supports.
The Nielsen poll, published on Tuesday, indicated a clear majority (56 per cent) was opposed to the tax.

BRISBANE, March 15 AAP - A Brisbane great-grandmother has become the first protester arrested at a blockade to stop a major coal seam gas development at Tara in southeast Queensland.
 The protest began on Monday with Tara residents, farmers and green groups forming a human barricade and locking their farm gates to stop Queensland Gas Company (QGC) workers entering properties to lay the pipes.
The protesters say they're in it for the long haul and camped overnight on Monday despite a mice plague in the area.
There is a heavy police presence at the site, including a public order response team, mounted police and plainclothes detectives.
June Norman, 70, was arrested before midday on Tuesday at the blockade site and taken to the Chinchilla police station.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said the great-grandmother was arrested when she refused an order from a plainclothes policeman to move while she was blockading a large bulldozer from entering the QGC site at Kenya.
Mr Hutton said Mrs Norman is involved in charity and community work and that her gentle presence belies her quiet determination to fight against coal seam gas mining and to protect the environment.
He said he expected Mrs Norman to be released from custody within an hour.
Mrs Norman said she was prepared to do anything for the cause.
 I have an obligation to my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to take a stand,  she said.
 I cannot have them living with the consequences of what our generations have done and are doing to this country.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"POLLNSW SYDNEY, March 15 AAP - The NSW opposition has derided the Labor government's new policy on coal seam gas as a  five minute to midnight  grab for votes.
And farmers say it does little to establish a balance between competing land uses.
 Premier Kristina Keneally announced on Tuesday that a returned Labor government would ban exploration for coal seam gas near national parks and ban the use of the toxic BTEX chemicals in fracturing rock to extract the gas.
Opposition primary industries spokesman Duncan Gay said this was a  laughable  attempt to make the community believe the government was committed to protecting agricultural land from mining activity.
 In typical Labor style we see a cynical five-to-midnight attempt to muster a few votes in next week's election,  Mr Gay said in a statement.
 We welcome them to the game, but quite frankly it's too little too late. 
The NSW Liberal and National parties had spent over 12 months consulting community groups and stakeholders to develop the coalition's land-use policy and Labor was simply appropriating their work, Mr Gay said.
 Labor says it will introduce exclusion zones to assist strategic land use planning - these words are almost taken straight from our policy,  he said.
Ms Keneally also said a Labor government would make miners pay more to landowners.
 A re-elected Keneally government will mandate minimum payments to landowners to recognise the business consequences of exploration and extraction activities on farming,  she announced.
And it would conduct an audit of gas wells and drill sites to see how operators had complied with conditions of approval, and appoint an industry ombudsman to investigate complaints.
This did not impress the NSW Farmers Association, which called the policy a plan for mining, not for agriculture.
Association president Charles Armstrong said the government's initiatives were welcome but inadequate.
 These are more than a decade too late and will not be enough to give farmers confidence about their ability to continue to produce food into the future,  Mr Armstrong said in a statement.
Labor had failed to engage the food sector and was ignoring the needs of agriculture and consumers in NSW, he said.
The NSW Minerals Council said it was worried about  knee-jerk  policy that would seriously affect future investment in the state.
 We welcome the focus on mining. We are not afraid of scrutiny and we are not afraid of change,  council CEO Nikki Williams said.
 But we should all be concerned about an election-driven auction over the future of the industry, where politicians are raising the stakes ever higher ... without careful consideration of what that says about doing business in NSW. 
Dr Williams said the Minerals Council was  deeply concerned  about the proposal to introduce exclusion zones.
 Strategic land-use planning will help to minimise tensions between industries, but decisions must be scientific and evidence-based,  she said.
The new Labor policy did not even please the Greens, who said it would be little comfort to the people who had already lost their farmland to mining companies.
Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said BTEX chemicals were a minor issue.
 The dangers of fracking (fracturing) are actually the fact that methane can be released during the fracking process and there are also other chemicals that the government has conveniently ignored to date,  Ms Faehrmann told reporters in Sydney.
 The government has been sending very strong signals to industry for 16 years now that NSW is open to coal seam gas mining.
 Now 10 days out from an election that looks like they can't win, it seems a bit of politicking to me.

 The use of BTEX chemicals would also be outlawed across the state while a coal and gas ombudsman would be appointed to investigate complaints about mining activities.
But Mr O'Farrell accused Labor of making pre-election commitments and failing to deliver, warning voters to be wary of its promises.
 The point that has to be made, a point that should be made is that this is too little, too late,  Mr O'Farrell told reporters in the Illawarra.
He said former Labor premier Bob Carr announced in the lead-up to the 1999 state election a fast-train project between Sydney and Wollongong that never materialised.
 Labor puts a lot of effort into fanfare, into marketing events,  Mr O'Farrell said.
 We've seen that over 16 years. What matters is not the fanfare, what matters is not the sizzle, what matters is the steak or the sausage. 
Mr O'Farrell also accused Labor of signing off on exploration leases without regard to local community impact or considering the balance between mining and agricultural interests.
 We've said that we will not sign up to a process that this government had ... where prime agricultural land, for instance, was under threat from mining,  he said.
Mr O'Farrell on Tuesday announced that 50 of the extra 550 hospital beds the coalition has promised, on top of Labor's commitment, will go to the Illawarra health district and 25 of the extra 275 nurses that the coalition has promised will also be dedicated to the local area.

 What we're doing today, some 10 days before the election, is providing clarity to the people of NSW about the direction that we're heading,  she told reporters.
 We recognise that this is not a finalised policy, because that needs to be done in consultation with a number of stakeholder groups.
 This is a roadmap ... that makes clear that we will have exclusion areas, we will protect those important waterways and we ban the use of BTEX chemicals. 
Environmental groups welcomed Labor's promise to outlaw the use of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes - BTEX chemicals - in the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process to extract coal seam gas.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2011,1,"Origin Energy Ltd says it's comfortable with its debt levels after announcing it will issue $2.3 billion in new shares to refinance some of the debt used for its acquisition of NSW electricity assets.
The company also said it would consider more capital raisings to fund its $35 billion Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas (APLNG) project in Queensland.
 The smaller than expected capital raising announced on Tuesday involves an entitlement offer that will allow Origin shareholders to buy one new share for every five shares currently owned.
The purchase price is $13 per new share, a 17 per cent discount on the company's closing price on Monday of $15.66.
Origin shares were placed in a trading halt on Tuesday ahead of the announcement about the capital raising.
Managing director Grant King said the refinancing of debt to fund the acquisition of the NSW assets, including Country Energy and Integral Energy, would allow Origin to restore its balance sheet to the same capital structure as it had prior to the purchase.
 At the half year, our gearing was about 22 per cent and at the completion of this raising remains at 23 per cent, so near enough to the same,  he said in a briefing on Tuesday.
 Quite clearly, what we're trying to achieve is to maintain the strength of Origin's balance sheet, given that we have a number of near-term growth opportunities ahead of us which will require capital and, of course, a very substantial opportunity in APLNG for which we will consider appropriate funding at the time. 
Proceeds from the share sale  will be applied to refinance part of the debt used to fund the $3.26 billion acquisition of the Integral Energy and Country Energy retail businesses and the Eraring GenTrader arrangements , Origin said.
Eraring Energy operates a coal-fired power station near Newcastle, and the Shoalhaven hydro-electric power scheme south of Sydney.
New Origin shares will rank equally with existing ordinary shares, with the first dividend payable to be Origin's final dividend for the year ending June 30.
EL&C Baillieu Stockbroking analyst Ivor Ries said analysts had expected a capital raising of more than $3 billion.
They expected a raising of around $700 million to $800 million for APLNG, a joint venture with ConocoPhillips that recently attracted China's Sinopec as a minority participant and offtake partner.
 The company said `we may not need to do that in the short term, we may have some other funding mechanisms available to us',  Mr Ries said.
 It tells you that they must be pretty confident that these new cornerstone investors coming into the LNG project are going to put a lot of money into it. 
He said Origin was a  huge cash cow , producing around $1.5 billion a year in cash flow and the gearing ratio was very low for a business of their nature.
 To have about $3 billion in net debt is not a lot. 
He also said the discount on the new shares was  what you would expect in a pretty rotten market .
Mr King reaffirmed Origin's underlying EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) growth forecast of around 35 per cent for the full year.
 We expect our underlying profit for the year to be up around 15 per cent on the prior year, so essentially we're reaffirming the guidance we gave in February consistent with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year,  he said.
Mr King said Origin was now the  leading energy retailer  in Australia.
 We have a strong position, particularly in gas resources, but in all forms of fuel, renewable resources and through coal contracts to support that portfolio,  he said.
Origin now has a total retail customer base of 4.5 million customers.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"QUAKE SYDNEY, March 15 AAP - The nuclear crisis in Japan is likely to lead to increased energy demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the short term, the head of Origin Energy Ltd says.
In a teleconference, managing director Grant King said the company was still at a stage where it was thinking about the enormous catastrophe in Japan.
  It's tragic for all the people who have been affected and, quite frankly, we're at that stage in the process where our thoughts are more to them than to what the future holds,  Mr King said after Origin Energy Ltd announced on Tuesday it would issue $2.3 billion in new shares.
The shares are being issued to refinance some of the debt used for its recent acquisition of NSW electricity assets.
His comments came prior to news that radiation is spewing from damaged reactors at a crippled nuclear power plant in tsunami-ravaged northeastern Japan.
Japanese authorities are warning residents to stay inside or risk getting radiation sickness.
Mr King said a large amount of power generation had been shut in Japan.
 Obviously a substantial amount of the nuclear fleet and, I think, I'm not adding any original insight to the comment that the balance of fuel in Japan is LNG,  Mr King said.
He said LNG demand increased after an earthquake in Japan about four years ago caused one nuclear plant to go down.
 It was very noticeable, at that time, the additional LNG demand in Japan to back up their fuel system accordingly,  he said.
 So one would expect near-term effects unquestionably. 
But he said Origin was not in the near-term business.
 In respect of the longer term market, the contracts, it's still in the crisis phase,  he said.
While Japan had a commitment to a  substantial nuclear build,  recent events could change the long-term fuel mix in that country.
 There are concerns being talked about in respect of the operation of the nuclear fleet and that may well lead to changes in targets that exist in the long-term fuel mix and that would clearly again be advantageous to LNG if that should occur,  he said.
Matthew Moore, an assistant vice-president and analyst at Moody's Investors Service, says demand for LNG in Japan will increase.
 Last Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan will likely raise that country's demand for oil and liquefied natural gas over the near term, as it deals with challenges related to its nuclear energy generation,  he said in a statement on Tuesday regarding oil prices.
 However, it is unclear at this point whether this will have any sustained impact on the oil sector's fundamentals.

Under the proposal, mining exploration would be banned in waterways adjoining national parks, other areas would be declared off limits to mining and the use of BTEX chemicals in the fracking process would be banned.
Kristina Keneally says she makes no apologies for announcing the proposed policy so close to an election.
 It's my view that just 10 days out from an election, the community should have a very clear view of where we would go when it comes to mining, when it comes to those competing land uses and when it comes to balancing out mining and the needs of the environment,  Ms Keneally said.
But the state opposition isn't buying that argument.
The Coalition's Primary Industries and Energy spokesman, Duncan Gay, described it as  a pretty cynical exercise .
 In the last days of the election campaign they're virtually saying that, what we've done for the last 16 years is wrong. We've had a look at the Opposition's policy and we've stolen a few things out of it,  he said.Tim Duddy is an Independent candidate for the Upper Hunter.
He believes that both parties are  incredibly addicted  to mining royalties.
 It doesn't work well when it comes to making proper strategic land use plans,  Mr Duddy said.
 It's very interesting that it's only now when they're facing the polls, that they're doing anything about it. 
While the Hunter Thoroughbred Breeders Association believes the move is encouraging, the president of the Hunter Valley Wine Industry Association, Andrew Margan, is not at all impressed.
 It's just too late,  he said.
 They should have done this a long time ago when the issue were at hand. 
Farmers have also reacted sceptically, as have environmentalists who say the BTEX chemicals are only part of the problem.
 The banning of BTEX is obviously a good step,  Warrick Jordan from the Newcastle branch of the Wilderness Society said.
 But the actual process of fracking releases toxic chemicals which exist in coal seams.
 Once they get into waterways you have very significant problems. So it's only a partial fix. 
The New South Wales Minerals Council says it is concerned about, what it calls, a knee-jerk reaction following a series of public meetings in the Hunter.
Council CEO Nikki Williams says the policies could affect future investment in the state.
 It certainly was never contemplated that the government would have four community meetings and then basically come up with a policy,  Ms Williams said.
 I do believe it's policy on the run. 
The man likely to be tasked with keeping all sides happy in this bitter dispute was harnessing energy of a different kind today.
On the campaign trail in Sydney, Barry O'Farrell took a tai chi lesson, and let it slip that even he thinks a Coalition victory is now inevitable.
 We could be doing this at the start of parliament,  Mr O'Farrell said,  just to get everyone in a harmonious mood as we seek to fix the state. 
If the polls are correct, Mr O'Farrell will be swept to power in eleven days time.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"DEMAND for Australia's key exports to Japan -- coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas -- is set to rise in the wake of the earthquake destruction, with prices to benefit from supply tightness.
Analysts are widely tipping the LNG sector to receive the biggest lift from the disaster, as Japan may increase gas-fired power stations following the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear plant.
 Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said if Japan shut down its nuclear reactors, LNG and coal would probably be the alternative fuel replacements.
``Clearly that is a potential benefit for those projects in the region that can supply over and above what they have got,'' he said.
``Australia will be one of the main beneficiaries of that.''
Woodside's shares jumped 40c to $42.20 yesterday, as the market looked to LNG plays.
The oil giant's North West Shelf operation produces about 16 million tonnes of LNG a year, of which 12-13 million tonnes goes to Japan, with the balance snapped up by China.
``At the margin, the NWS does sell some spot cargoes, which may mean they could be sold to Japan, but there isn't a lot of flexibility there for them to massively add volumes to Japan because of the existing production capacity,'' Mr Hirjee said.
``What will happen is a lot of traded LNG will be offered to Japan. Britain's BG Group is one of the largest LNG traders in the world, so they will probably assist in bringing cargoes from their portfolio to Japan.
``There may also be some assistance provided by some of the other customers and there has been early talk that some of the Korean and Chinese customers may defer their cargoes in favour of helping the Japanese out.''
Australia's coal sector is also set to benefit, with demand for thermal coal likely to increase in the short term and coking coal in the long term, when the rebuild starts.
Analysts expect a further boost to the prices, which were already elevated because the sector was dealing with supply issues following the Queensland floods in January.
Quarterly coal contract negotiations between major producers and Japanese steelmakers were already in the final stages and AngloAmerican has reportedly set a record coking coal price of $US330 a tonne.
Swiss mining giant Xstrata is believed to be in Japan to finalise coal contracts this week, but industry experts said it could be slightly delayed because of the disaster.
``Coal supply was already going to be tight because of the recovery from the Queensland floods, so this disaster could keep both coal markets tighter for longer than analysts were thinking,'' one analyst said. ``Japan might have a couple of bad quarters but then they will have to rebuild.''

Since ActewAGL introduced its Staying Connected program last year, complaints to the tribunal have fallen from about 120 a month to about 50. Senior member of the tribunal Peter Sutherland said that before the program had begun, complaints from people having difficulty paying for utilities had been at the highest level ever. ActewAGL has reminded customers of its program which it says can help to keep essential services connected while people get back on track. ActewAGL general manager retail Ayesha Razzaq said the Staying Connected program provided eligible customers with confidential and personalised support. This could include an affordable payment plan for electricity, natural gas and water bills. Mr Sutherland said the program was not mandatory under ACT legislation but would become so nationally.
  It was always best to first try to resolve any financial difficulty with the utility. Ms Razzaq said 422 customers were currently on the program. They represented 0.02 per cent of water customers, 0.21 per cent of ACT electricity customers and 0.31 per cent of NSW electricity customers.A steady increase of customers joining the program was expected to continue with higher demand for electricity during winter.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"LNG - DISASTER IN JAPAN
Exporters of liquefied natural gas can expect a brighter medium-term outlook for demand growth in earthquake-hit Japan but have only limited capacity to respond to a more immediate rise in consumption.
 Nomura estimates that 15 nuclear units with a total capacity of 15 gigawatts are offline due to the quake, potentially driving an additional 6.6 million tonnes of LNG demand over the next year, assuming half the lost output is replaced by gas-fired power.
Japan already imports about two- thirds of Australia's almost 20 million tonnes a year of LNG production, including all the output from ConocoPhillips' Darwin plant and about 70 per cent of the larger North West Shelf venture's output.
Woodside Petroleum's $14 billion Pluto LNG project, due to start exports in September, will also send almost all its output to Japan.
With most of Australia's LNG supplies already committed under term contracts to Tokyo Electric Power, Tokyo Gas and other Japanese utilities, the country's capacity to provide extra cargoes is more limited than in the world's biggest exporter, Qatar.
Qatar has said it was able to supply  any quantity  to Japan, while South Korea is planning to divert some cargoes there this month and next, according to newswire reports.
Russia reportedly may redirect to Japan two tankers carrying LNG from its Sakhalin plant.
 Australia already supplies a huge amount of LNG to Japan under contract; it has overtaken Indonesia now as the second biggest supplier to Japan after Malaysia,  Graeme Bethune, chief executive of energy economics adviser EnergyQuest, said.
 But I'm sure that, to the extent there is capacity for spot cargoes, they would be keen to supply those as well,  he added.
ConocoPhillips said it was monitoring the situation but couldn't comment further. The North West Shelf venture said it was offering customers support without giving details.
Woodside agreed in January to send extra cargoes from Pluto not already committed to its two Japanese customers to Malaysia's Petronas. A spokeswoman couldn't say yesterday whether that might change.
Nigeria, Algeria and Trinidad could also help supply increased Japanese LNG needs, political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said.
Analysts warned of the potential for short-term disruptions to LNG imports into Japan because of destroyed distribution infrastructure, not to mention the devastation across many coastal regions.
But there have been no reports of damage at Japan's LNG receiving terminals. Woodside, as operator of the North West Shelf venture, expects no delays or cancellations of LNG cargoes in the near term, Nomura said.
Longer term, the nuclear difficulties were likely to drive a switch back to LNG as a fuel for power generation, analysts said. That is in contrast to Japan's latest energy plan, which envisages LNG's share of electricity generation slumping to 10 per cent by 2030 from 28 per cent in 2007 as new nuclear plants are added.
Japanese utilities including Tokyo Electric, Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas are already major customers for many new LNG projects under development, including Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone plants, Shell's Prelude and BG's Queensland projects.
But the latest problems could trigger a new demand wave from Japan.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"There was little rest for a number of very senior staffers and directors at Origin Energy over the weekend, as key personnel were believed to be working on the next development in what is shaping up as an action-packed year.
The weekend call-in was probably linked to the progress of Origin's 50 per cent-owned Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project, which is the key thing standing in the way of the first of up to two equity raisings facing Origin in the not-too-distant future.
 Upgrading the memorandum of understanding over the APLNG offtake agreement with China's Sinopec into a firm sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a major objective for Origin right now and one that, if achieved, could pave the way for the first raising.
There's talk that the continuing equity market wobbles stemming from Middle East uncertainty and, more recently, the Japanese earthquake and tsunami could be seized upon by Sinopec as a means of demanding a lower price for LNG under the deal. Such actions would not be a first for Sinopec, which played hardball similarly when trying to finalise an SPA with partners in the Papua New Guinea LNG project a few years back.
But the reason for the long hours over the weekend is believed to lie elsewhere. Origin and its partner in APLNG, ConocoPhillips, are already well down the path of negotiations with a number of potential offtakers, and the earthquake could well have helped those discussions progress.
The nuclear problems that followed last Friday's earthquake could lead to a switch in Japan away from nuclear energy and towards LNG, which could help Origin and Conoco secure another buyer sooner rather than later.
Another customer would further boost APLNG's chances of improvement, and would again take Origin another step closer to the multi-billion-dollar raising that has been on its radar since its successful $3.5 billion purchase of assets under the NSW power privatisation program.
Elsewhere, it's D-Day for Alinta's debt-for-equity swap deal with creditors, with lawyers and advisors representing more than 40 creditors to the ailing energy company to meet at 10am for the quick formality of passing the resolutions to approve their $2.1 billion debt-for-equity swap.
That meeting is expected to go more smoothly than the extraordinary general meeting later today, where activist shareholders might keep the poker play with the bargaining rights they have, for which they have been offered 10Â¢ in the dollar. Directors have already said that shareholders might receive a maximum 3.3Â¢ in the dollar should the deal not go through and the company goes into voluntary administration.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG By Tony Bartlett
GOLD COAST, Qld, March 16 AAP - A coal seam gas company says it's happy to buy a padlock for a Queensland property owner who claims he's been locked out of part of his property.
 But the Queensland Gas Company (QGC) won't discuss the resident's offer to sell them his land at a fraction of its value.
Tara resident Paul Keating has accused QGC of bullying him, locking him out of part of his land, and slowly sending him broke.
Mr Keating, who grew sick of government departments hanging up on him, now goes by the nickname of Bryce to avoid confusion with the former prime minister.
He has accused QGC of treating him with contempt, saying its coal seam gas project has destroyed the value of his land.
The company is at the centre of a landholder revolt playing out across the Tara rural residential estate west of Toowoomba.
Protesters have rallied there this week, vowing to block the construction of a 16km pipeline to take coal seam gas from a network of wells on QGC and private land to the company's plant nearby.
They're deeply concerned about the effect the project will have on their health, the environment including groundwater stores, and land values.
The protesters have vowed to form a human barricade to stop work on the pipeline when it reaches the boundary of QGC-controlled land.
Among those concerned about land values is Mr Keating, who said he was trying to sell his property  but the real estate agents won't even come out to put a sign up because it's not worth the effort .
 People have come out to inspect the property and they love my house, but as soon as they find out it's affected by the QGC pipeline they're gone,  Mr Keating said.
 The property's worth $250,000 but I'd take $100,000 for it if I could get it right now. That'd be better than losing it totally to the bank.
 In fact, I'm trying to get QGC to buy it for charity, I'd like them to pay out my mortgage, let me live here till I pass away then turn it into a wildlife refuge centre or something.
 My solicitor put it to (QGC) but they never replied. 
Mr Keating says that two years ago QGC padlocked an access road it put through his property.
Despite repeated promises, he said he's still waiting for a key so he can get onto parts of his own land.
The company said they will be happy to buy Mr Keating a lock for the gate.
 We'll fix the problem, and we are always happy to talk to him,  a spokesman said on Tuesday.
However QGC said it has a policy of not discussing negotiations concerning the purchase of properties.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The major parties revisited familiar territory on the campaign trail yesterday with the New South Wales Premier in the Hunter Valley announcing a 10-point plan to deal with coal seam gas mining
The Opposition Leader promised sporting grants for Sydney's inner west, splashing out almost $50 million on regional sporting grants, including $2 million for a rundown soccer stadium in suburban Leichardt.
 Barry O'Farrell says it's a worthy initiative.
 To make it the centre of soccer in the inner west, to ensure lots more kids of both genders have the opportunity to aspire to play in the game at the highest levels,  Barry O'Farrell said.
The Premier had a different message to sell, taking her campaign to farmers in the Hunter Valley.
Kristina Keneally has promised to ban hazardous chemicals used in fracking - a controversial technique used to extract coal seam fgas.
 There's no evidence to date that those chemicals are being used in New South Wales. But they certainly, everything seems to suggest they are carcinogenic,  Ms Keneally said.
The Opposition has made a similar pledge, but the Greens say the promise to ban BTEX chemicals in coal seam gas operations is a hollow one.
Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann says the chemicals are naturally occurring and can be released into groundwater and soils during the process of fracking regardless of whether they're added or not.
 The Greens are calling for a moratorium on coal seam gas exploration until the industry can be proven safe,  Ms Faehrmann said
The campaign for both the major parties continues to be fought in key labor seats.
In the past week the Premier has visited Newcastle twice, while Barry O'Farrell has been a frequent visitor to Wollongong.
In Sydney, the Labor seats of Strathfield and Balmain are now the major focus for the Coalition.
The state government, meanwhile, is being accused of behaving lawlessly in pushing ahead with Sydney's Barangaroo development.
First the Planning Minister made the project exempt from environmental safeguards.
It has now emerged that Tony Kelly has changed another law, paving the way for a hotel to be built on a pier at Barangaroo.
More than 200 protesters gathered to call for a Commission of Inquiry into the development.
Mr O'Farrell says he's concerned about the changes in the law, but he won't commit to a judicial inquiry.
 We're not going to support inquiries or initiate inquiries if they can't actually achieve a purpose,  he said.

The Premier Kristina Keneally yesterday announced a 10 point plan that includes banning B-TEX chemicals in coal seam gas extraction.
 The government also say they'd set up mining exclusion zones around sensitive areas and appoint a coal and gas ombudsman.
Primary Industries Spokesman Duncan Gay says it is a political document that shows the government is not serious about the issue.
 It's five to midnight, I just can't believe that at the end of their term, they're now putting out a document that indicates that everything they've done for the last 16 years was wrong,  he said.
 And if they were fair dinkum they would have put it out a week ago when they actually had the power to make changes,  he said.
The Coalition says they will consider the ideas put forward in the government's plan for managing coal and gas exploration.
Under another proposal, gas pipelines would also be forced to use public land or travelling stock routes, which has implications for Eastern Star's proposed Narrabri to Wellington pipeline.
The company has met with strong opposition from Mullaley land holders who are concerned the pipeline will damage with farmland, which is blacksoil floodplain.
Duncan Gay says the Opposition supports keeping Eastern Star's pipeline off agricultural land.
 It's a determined preference that wherever possible we believe you should goon public land and in this case there is a viable alternative almost completely on public land, we would certainly be pushing that way,  he said.
The New South Wales Farmers' Association says the Coalition's criticisms of the plan are valid.
The Association's Vice President and Liverpool Plains farmer Fiona Simpson says the government has some good ideas but no overall strategy.
 The ring fencing is good, the Ombudsman is good the audit of gas exploration is good,  she said.
 So there's a couple of good ideas there but it's not underpinned by any great new change in process which is what we would really be looking for,  she said.
Ms Simpson says the government's plan appears to lack substance.
 We need to consider our natural resources,  she said.
We need to look at these things and we need to plan for where we can mine them and where we can't and that is what is lacking in this policy.

AGEE,The Age,2011,1,"ORIGIN Energy will raise $2.3 billion to cover its acquisition of New South Wales' electricity assets, in a play that may not be its last capital raising of the year.
As Origin sought to entice shareholders into the capital raising with a 17 per cent price discount, the company refused to rule out a return to the market to fund plans for a massive coal seam gas project in Queensland.
 Origin has been examining funding options for a $35 billion joint venture with ConocoPhillips â€” known as the Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas (APLNG) project â€” to sell gas from Queensland to China.
Investors are keenly awaiting a final investment decision and Origin director Karen Moses said there was international interest that was exciting the banks.
 APLNG has got access to all the funding options you could possibly imagine,  she said.  We don't know what equity we will end up with because we are still talking to customers who may want to take more equity in APLNG. 
The project received a boost last month when Chinese company Sinopec signed a heads of agreement to buy 4.3 million tonnes of LNG each year for 20 years.
Origin would not offer a deadline for the final investment decision on APLNG, but said the deal could be finalised before the new capital-raising project was completed on April 18.
Yesterday's move to raise $2.3 billion to reduce debts was long expected, but E.L. & C. Baillieu analyst Ivor Ries said the raising was smaller than he expected.
 We were expecting something north of $3 billion because we thought they would raise some of the money they needed towards APLNG,  he said.  For them not to raise the additional money means they have a high degree of confidence there is some more stuff coming. 
Origin shareholders will be able to buy one new share for every five they own, and will pay $13 a share.
The price of the offer is 17 per cent below Monday's closing price of $15.66.
The announcement pushed Origin to the top of the profit growth band that the company promised late last year when it bought the controversial NSW electricity assets.
 We expect underlying profit for the year to be up around 15 per cent on the prior year,  said managing director Grant King.  What we're trying to achieve is to maintain the strength of Origin's balance sheet given we have a number of near-term growth opportunities ahead of us. 
The sale of electricity assets has dogged the NSW Labor Party in recent years.
Despite suggestions the deal was rushed to market before the expected change of government, Origin said the offer had been conducted at the first practical opportunity.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"But coal seam gas mining opponents still unconvinced
DESPITE the assertions of gasexploration company Metgasco that coal seam gas extraction is safe, Lesley McQueen, of Lynchs Creek, remains unconvinced.

Metgasco's chief financial officer, Glenda McLoughlin, said the company did not use hydraulic fracturing â€“ known as fraccing â€“ nor poisonous chemicals in the well-drilling process.
Responding to a question from the audience, Ms McLoughlin also said Metgasco's access agreements with farmers were voluntary and the company was committed to operating in an open and transparent way. She also said Metgasco had not finalised a starting point or definitive route for a proposed gas pipeline along the Lions Rd to South-East Queensland.
â€œI am scared. I felt like they danced around the questions and didn't give direct answers,â€? Ms McQueen told The Northern Star.
â€œI don't think they will really know the extent of (environmental) damage for 20 years. It's too late then, isn't it,â€? she said.
NSW Labor has moved to counter public concern on the issue by releasing a 10-point plan, which Premier Kristina Keneally said â€œstrikes a balance between the needs of the mining industry and community concerns about environmental protectionâ€?.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"MINING industry leaders in NSW have slammed both sides of politics for risking the state's economic future by courting the green vote in the lead-up to the state election.
Labor yesterday released its coal and coal-seam gas policy roadmap to a generally frosty reception, while the Coalition drew further criticism for failing to release sufficient detail on its proposed changes to planning laws.
 NSW Minerals Council chief executive Nikki Williams said both parties were playing a dangerous game.
``We should all be concerned about an election-driven auction over the future of the industry, where politicians are raising the stakes ever higher for an election victory, without careful consideration of what that says about doing business in NSW,'' Dr Williams said yesterday.
Labor's plan, which NSW Premier Kristina Keneally said would balance the interests of mining with those of agriculture and tourism, would ban exploration activities in waterways adjoining national parks, and even go so far as to revoke some exploration licences already granted.
Dr Williams said the mining industry was not afraid of scrutiny, but the proposal to tear up exploration leases was very worrying.
Ms Keneally said her re-elected government would also ban the use of BTEX chemicals in coal-seam gas operations, and declare certain areas of land as no-go zones for miners.
Labor's plan would also see the appointment of a coal and gas ombudsman, and a full audit of all gas wells and drill sites across NSW in order to allay community concerns, even though no problems with these wells have so far been found.
The Coalition derided Labor's plan, describing it as a ``five minutes to midnight grab for votes''.
Opposition primary industries spokesman Duncan Gay said the Coalition would not revoke any exploration licences unless they breached existing rules.
However, as The Australian reported on Monday, the opposition itself has drawn criticism from industry leaders for refusing to outline its proposed changes to critical infrastructure planning laws that govern mining approvals before the election.
The Coalition's land-use policy, announced last month, signalled new restrictions on exploration licences, including an explicit agricultural impact assessment and regulations governing interference with aquifers. The Coalition would also ban the use of BTEX chemicals.
Industry insiders said the pledge to abolish the use of BTEX chemicals in fracturing rock to extract gas from coal seams was a non-issue for the sector, as most believed the chemicals were not used in NSW, something Ms Keneally confirmed.
The process of ``fracking'' involves injecting chemicals into the ground to help extract gas from coal seams and in some cases BTEX chemicals -- benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes -- are used.
Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union vice-president Wayne McAndrew said he was disappointed by the release of Labor's draft plan, which had caught him by surprise.
NSW Farmers Association president Charles Armstrong said Labor's plan did not go far enough.
The new Labor policy did not even please the Greens, who said it would be little comfort to the people who had already lost their farmland to mining companies.
Upper house Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said: ``The government has been sending very strong signals to industry for 16 years now that NSW is open to coal-seam gas mining,'' she said. ``Now 10 days out from an election that looks like they can't win, it seems a bit of politicking to me.''

The market had been expecting the energy retailer to tap the market for the purchase of a portfolio of assets in NSW, and attention was quickly turning yesterday to the company's massive liquefied natural gas joint venture with ConnocoPhillips, Australia Pacific LNG.
 Origin executive director of finance and strategy Karen Moses said yesterday that APLNG had access to ``all funding options''.
``Credit agencies will be interested and it will have partners from around the world, so the banks are very interested,'' she said.
``The choices for Origin in considering how the funding moves forward will be a question of what provides us with the most certainty and the least cost.''

Deutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee said although there was little surprise in Origin's previously guided equity raising, the quantum pointed to a focus on balance-sheet strength leading into a potential APLNG mid-year financial investment decision.
``A raising price of $13 a share was below our expectations but . . . we recognise the need to ensure a successful raising,'' Mr Hirjee said.
RBS analyst Jason Mabee said he was a little surprised Origin didn't wait until more clarity could be provided on APLNG's final structure and funding.
Managing director Grant King said although he agreed $13 was low, it was a consequence of the terms of the raising.
`` I would have loved for the share price to be $18 or $20 or some higher number,'' he said.
According to the company, the funds raised would reduce the debt associated with the $3.26bn purchase of electricity assets privatised by the NSW government: Integral Energy and Country Energy's retail businesses, and the Eraring GenTrader arrangements.
``The acquisition of the NSW energy assets is a milestone for Origin and is expected to be materially accretive to underlying earnings per share,'' chairman Kevin McCann said.
The company also reconfirmed the current trading conditions, as outlined in its half-year results on February 24.
It expects full-year underlying earnings to increase by about 35 per cent compared with the previous financial year, while underlying profit ispredicted to rise by 15 per cent on the last year.
Origin generates more than $1.5bn a year in cash flow and its net debt stands at about $2bn.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"A BRISBANE great-grandmother has become the first protester arrested at a blockade to stop a major coal seam gas development at Tara in southeast Queensland.
The protest began on Monday with Tara residents, farmers and green groups forming a human barricade and locking farm gates to stop Queensland Gas Company (QGC) workers entering properties to lay the pipes.
 The protesters say they will be in it for the long haul and camped overnight on Monday. There is a heavy police presence, including a public order response team, mounted police and plainclothes detectives.
June Norman, 70, (pictured) was driven to Chinchilla police station and charged with failing to comply with police directions.
Ms Norman said she was not locked up and was released to appear in Chinchilla Magistrates Court on March 30.

FMAITM,Maitland Mercury,2011,1,"A ban on mining licences in waterways adjoining national parks announced in Labor's plan to address coal mining and coal seam gas exploration does not go far enough, says Greens candidate for Cessnock James Ryan.
Premier Kristina Keneally announced the 10-point plan in Millfield yesterday, saying it struck a balance between the needs of the mining industry and community concerns about environmental protection.
 Central to the plan were bans on mining licences in waterways adjoining national parks and the use of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes chemicals in coal seam gas operations.
 We recognise that there are concerns about the impact of coal seam gas mining and the technique known as hydraulic-fracturing or fracking, but we also need to protect jobs in the industry. This policy strikes a balance,  Ms Keneally said.
But Greens candidate and Cessnock councillor James Ryan said the announcement was  akin to playing with the deck chairs on the Titanic while the ship is still sinking. 
 Waterways adjacent to national parks in Cessnock make up a very small part of the exploration license areas,  he said.
 The Greens want a full moratorium on coal seam gas exploration and mining until such time as it can be shown to be safe.
 Like the Coalition policy which suggests sensitive lands might be excluded from mining areas, we have yet to see any detail on how sensitive areas will be defined.

NEHR,The Newcastle Herald,2011,1,"Exclusion zones unveiled : STATE ELECTION 2011
PREMIER Kristina Keneally used another campaign stop in the Hunter to unveil a 10-point plan for how Labor would deal with coalmining and coal seam gas, less than a fortnight from the election and after years of community calls for action.
 Announcing the plan at a Millbrook Estate near Millfield yesterday, Ms Keneally said Labor would, if re-elected, move to impose exclusion zones around valuable industries such as the Hunter's thoroughbred and wine industries. Other measures would include a ban on the use of so-called  BTEX  chemicals in hydraulic fracturing or  fracking  for coal-seam gas extraction.
An audit of gas wells and drill sites in NSW would check compliance with approval conditions, and a coal and gas ombudsman would be appointed to investigate complaints.
The opposition labelled the plan a  five minutes to midnight attempt to muster a few votes  after years of inaction.
The NSW Minerals Council said it was deeply concerned about  an election-driven auction over the future of the [mining] industry  and the proposed exclusion zones, and said land-use decisions must instead be  scientific and evidence-based .
But The Hunter Valley Protection Alliance and the Hunter Thoroughbred Breeders Association welcomed the plan and said they wanted the Coalition to commit to exclusion zones in the region in addition to the policy it had already unveiled.
Ms Keneally said Labor would continue its efforts to upgrade science labs, and pledged $102 million to finish the project with upgrades to about 200 schools, including high schools at Cardiff, Glendale, Toronto, Rutherford and Morisset and Wallsend's Callaghan College.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2011,1,"TIME TO CHOOSE
KRISTINA KENEALLY has pre-empted her government's review of the coal and gas industry and committed to banning the use of a toxic group of chemicals in the controversial technique known as fracking to extract coal seam gas.
 The Premier published a 10-point plan for coalmining and coal seam gas exploration that includes a ban on mining licences in waterways adjoining national parks and reducing exploration in sensitive areas.
Ms Keneally, who was campaigning in the wine region of the Hunter, conceded that the review was still under way but said voters deserved to be aware of Labor's plans for the mining industry before the election.
 What we're doing today, some 10 days before the election, is providing clarity to the people of NSW about the direction that we're heading,  Ms Keneally said.
 We recognise that this is not a finalised policy, because that needs to be done in consultation with a number of stakeholder groups ... this is a road map ... that makes clear that we will have exclusion areas, we will protect those important waterways and we will ban the use of BTEX chemicals. 
The chemicals benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - collectively referred to as BTEX - are sometimes used in the fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, process for extracting coal seam gas.
Ms Keneally said there was no evidence to suggest BTEX chemicals were being used in NSW but a re-elected Labor government would ban their use because they are carcinogenic.
The Planning Minister, Tony Kelly, published a scoping paper last month on the coal and gas industries to provide an overview of the main problems facing the coalmining regions of the Hunter, Gunnedah and the western and southern coalfields.
Yesterday Mr Kelly said the 10-point plan would provide greater certainty for all sides of the coal debate.
But Nikki Williams, the chief executive of the NSW Minerals Council, said that it was a knee-jerk policy announced for political purposes.
 We are not afraid of scrutiny and we are not afraid of change,  Dr Williams said.
 But we should all be concerned about an election-driven auction over the future of the industry, where politicians are raising the stakes ever higher for an election victory, without careful consideration of what that says about doing business in NSW. 
The opposition primary industries spokesman, Duncan Gay, said the government had thrown together a plan for the mining industry at the last minute.
 In typical Labor style we see a cynical five to midnight attempt to muster a few votes in next week's election,  he said.
The Greens mining spokeswoman, Cate Faehrmann, said banning BTEX chemicals was a red herring and would not protect aquifers from contamination.
 Fracking is extremely dangerous, regardless of whether BTEX is injected,  she said.
Ms Keneally was also in Newcastle with the Tourism Minister, Jodi McKay, to promise $102 million would be spent over four years on upgrading 780 school science laboratories.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The federal government will spend $728,000 to help long-term unemployed, women, migrants and indigenous people to secure jobs and training in the multibillion-dollar coal seam gas industry in Queensland.
Local and international resources giants, including British Gas, Santos, Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips, are expected to spend more than $65 billion over the next three years to extract liquefied natural gas from at least three projects in the Gladstone region.
 The federal government and the Queensland government will attempt to capitalise on the demand for skilled workers in the region and aim to encourage at least 200 people into  sustainable jobs  in local businesses. This represents an average federal spend of $3640 for each person helped into a resources industry job.
It is expected that electrical trades will be in high demand for the LNG, coal seam gas and construction regions.
If successful, the approach will be replicated in other regions where there are large-scale industrial developments.
In addition, a Cairns-based  fly-in fly-out co-ordinator  will be appointed to match job seekers with mining, construction and infrastructure projects in remote areas.
The pilot project is expected to promote local unemployed job seekers as candidates for fly-in fly-out operations, instead of the jobs going to highly paid workers from interstate.
The federal government will advertise in local newspapers in Cairns and on the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations website for the co-ordinator role.
 If successful, this pilot project may be rolled out to other regional centres,  Employment Minister Chris Evans said.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"A combination of earthquake, tsunami and Japan's worst nuclear accidents is poised to damage the world's third-largest economy, but economists say this is just one of many shocks with which investors are grappling, adding it is too early to measure the real fallout for Australia.
Japan receives 18 per cent of Australia's exports â€“ 40 per cent of Australia's exported coal, 17 per cent of its iron ore and 65 per cent of its natural gas.
 Economic activity will be hindered immediately and the Bank of Japan will do what it can.
But JPMorgan chief economist Stephen Walters said it was still too early to be clear on the likely indirect impact of the tragedy.
 Friday's earthquake added to the unusual array of shocks that are buffeting the global economy in early 2011,  Mr Walters said.
 The lengthy list includes the oil price shock, surging food prices, severe winter weather in the US and Europe, Lunar New Year holiday disruptions in China and simmering tensions surrounding the EMU [economic and monetary union] fiscal crisis.''
He said if the recent oil price rise was sustained it would  boost the export price side of Australia's terms of trade , while the  mammoth rebuilding effort  should lift demand for Australian commodities.
 The near-term impact on prices and export volumes, however, remains unclear.''
Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief economist Michael Blythe noted that previous earthquakes were a good guide to how Japan would handle this one.
The economy was very quick to rebound after the Kobe earthquake in January 1995, just as it was after the less severe Niigata Chuetsu quake in 2004.
The Kobe earthquake was smaller than the latest one but economically the region was more important.
 Kobe was a major port and manufacturing centre,  said Mr Blythe.  The damage from the Kobe quake was eventually put at $US102 billion or 2.5 per cent of Japanese gross domestic product. But the recovery was reasonably quick and certainly faster than expected at the time.''
In fact, the period after the Kobe quake was the strongest for growth since the early 1990s recession.
Japan's economic growth is in a better profile than it was in 1995.
But with debt twice the size of its $US5 trillion economy and facing credit downgrades, the government is discussing a temporary tax rise to fund relief work.
Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch expects the cost for the rebuilding could be at least 1 per cent of GDP.
Nomura expects the size of any extra budget for rebuilding to exceed Â¥3 trillion ($36.2 billion) and believes the Japanese economy will take longer than expected to leave its current soft patch owing to the earthquake and tsunami.
Japan is Australia's second-largest trading partner, accounting for 11.7 per cent of two-way trade.
But Mr Blythe said despite this important relationship, there had been little correlation between Australian and Japanese growth over most of the past 15 years.
 The Australian economy has grown strongly over most of this period despite a lacklustre Japanese growth performance,  he said.
Australia's major exports are coal and iron ore and these are set on long-term contracts, so trade has been relatively steady.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"In the largest equity raising this year, Origin Energy will tap shareholders for $2.3 billion to cover its NSW power acquisitions, but still may face a separate funding round later this year for its huge liquefied natural gas project in Queensland.
The well-flagged sale, at $13 per share, will allow the refinancing of bridging loans the energy supplier took out in December to cover its $3.26 billion of purchases from the NSW government, which more than doubled Origin's customer numbers and made it the country's biggest electricity and gas retailer.
 The pro rata renounceable offer, the second-largest equity raising on record in the oil and gas sector, will also bolster Origin's balance sheet as it faces more than $1 billion of capital expenditure spending this year, including a geothermal power project in New Zealand, the completion of a gas-fired generator in Victoria and investments in coal seam gas supply in Queensland.
The exact timing of the offer still surprised some, with RBS yesterday querying why Origin hadn't waited until there was more  good news  on the table around its Australia Pacific LNG project, which would have lifted the sale price.
Origin's stock price has so far failed to reflect much value for APLNG, despite recent progress in securing environmental approvals and signing an initial sales deal with China's Sinopec, which has yet to be firmed up.
But the terms of the capital raising were locked in with the underwriters in December when Origin first bid for the NSW assets in a potentially complex transaction when it didn't know which assets it would win, Origin managing director Grant King said yesterday.
 I absolutely agree that $13 is a low price but it's a consequence of the terms of the raising, the discount in relation to the share price at the close yesterday,  he said.
The one-for-five entitlement offer, underwritten by JPMorgan, Macquarie Capital Advisers and Merrill Lynch, will be split evenly between institutions and retail investors. It is the biggest issue in Australia since the beginning of last year, topping Woodside's $2.23 billion rights offer last February and illustrating the hefty funding demands of Australia's several mega-LNG projects.
The 17 per cent discount in the sale to Monday's close was slightly steeper than many in the market had expected. But because all shareholders participate equally in the pro rata issue, which isn't open to other investors, the actual price is not material, said Karen Moses, Origin's executive director, finance and strategy.
The price should ensure a good take-up of the entitlements, analysts said yesterday.
 With potential future raisings to support APLNG and uncertainty prior to a final investment decision, we recognise the need to ensure a successful raising,  said Deutsche Bank's John Hirjee, and that shareholders should subscribe to the offer given the discount.
RBS calculated that the offer only dilutes its valuation of Origin by about 5Â¢ to 10Â¢ a share.  Therefore we wouldn't be turning down stock at $13 per share. 
Origin yesterday lifted its full-year profit guidance back to a 15 per cent rise in underlying earnings, from the 10 per cent to 15 per cent increase forecast in February, to reflect the lower interest cost on its debt after partly repaying the bridging loan.
The company agreed in December to acquire NSW power retailers Integral Energy and Country Energy from the NSW government for $2.3 billion, increasing its electricity and gas customers by more than 50 per cent to 4.6 million. It also paid $959 million for the Eraring Energy power trading contracts.
Those acquisitions, completed on March 1, will immediately add to earnings, according to Origin.
The raising will bring Origin's gearing, currently at 36 per cent, back down to 23 per cent, only marginally above where it was prior to the NSW purchase.
Moody's said it would likely lead to the outlook on Origin's Baa1 rating reverting to stable from negative.
The funding options for APLNG will be determined down the track and could include project debt financing, export credit agency funds, or potentially equity, Ms Moses said.
 APLNG has access to all the funding options that you could imagine,  she said.  We're not feeling funding constrained at all. 
Analysts were divided yesterday whether Origin will need another multi-billion dollar equity raising for APLNG, which is due to get the go-ahead around mid-year.
Nomura Australia's Xavier Grunauer said that even allowing for a possible $1.4 billion hybrid issue and a likely further sell-down of project equity, Origin could still need to raise up to $2 billion.
 We're looking at a second equity raising over the next six months,  Mr Grunauer said.  That means that until we hear further news regarding APLNG, I doubt that the stock will break out of its trading range. 
But RBS's Jason Mabee said that with a hybrid issue and strong free cash flow, Origin should avoid another  material  equity issue over the next 12 months.
KEY POINTS

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Farmers 2 Miners 0
NSW Labor has joined the Coalition in a tougher approach to the mining sector, with plans to ban exploration in waterways next to national parks and introduce exclusion zones in areas that are  environmentally, socially or economically significant . It would also ban the harmful BTEX chemicals in coal seam gas operations. NSW Minerals Council chief executive Nikki Williams said,  We should all be concerned about an election-driven auction over the future of the industry.  Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell said there was no  sizzle  in Premier Kristina Keneally's policy  sausage .
 Torn to shreds
Barry O'Farrell has a rare gift for working references to Labor's  incompetence ,  scandals  and  bungled  power deals into announcements, and the revelation that Premier Kristina Keneally gave a standard directive to the public service to destroy government documents was a golden opportunity. Holding forth on Shredder Gate yesterday, Mr O'Farrell said some things can't be shredded, namely,  incompetence ,  scandals  and the memory of  shutting down Parliament early to avoid scrutiny of the electricity deal . Triple score!
Donâ€™t bet on it
Apparently things are looking a bit grim for Camp Keneally. Bookmaker Sportingbet said the Coalition had  made election punting history  yesterday after a $130,000 bet placed it at $1.01 to win against Labor at $16, the shortest odds possible.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG BRISBANE, March 17 AAP - Photographs of coal seam gas wells prove a rural residential estate will be  turned into a pincushion  if a planned pipeline goes ahead, protesters say.
They have set up a blockade to try to stop a gas pipeline entering Tara estate, 200kms west of Brisbane.
 The Lock the Gate campaign said the aerial photos, taken in 2008 and 2010, of an area south of Chinchilla near the estate, revealed how it would look  once the coal seam gas company QGC forces its way in .
Lock the Gate organiser Drew Hutton said the photos showed how gas wells, placed 450 to 750 metres apart, turned an area into a pincushion, making it impossible for residents to lead a normal life.
 This will be what the Tara estate will look like when it gets coal seam gas.
 This is the reality of coal seam gas,  Mr Hutton said.
He said under Tara estate were some of the most bountiful supplies of gas in the region, so the wells would be closely spaced.
 QGC will push its way onto the estate. It will connect up some wells and then put pressure on neighbouring landowners to sign an agreement to have wells on their properties,  he said.
 They will eat the heart out of the community and the ones who live there will have to put up with the impacts on their health, safety and amenity and they will never be able to sell their blocks.
 This is why Tara residents, along with environmentalists, are determined to block their entry onto the estate. 
The protesters have established a blockade on land that separates the gas company from Tara estate and say they'll  use all non-violent means at our disposal  to stop the QGC pipeline.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"Concern over the potential impact of coal seam gas exploration on local water supplies has prompted a public meeting tonight in the Hunter Valley.
Resource giant, Santos, is currently examining the potential of gas reserves near Bunnan, north-west of Scone.
 The Hunter Valley Thoroughbred Breeders Association's recent screening of the controversial American documentary, 'Gas Land', now has residents of Bunnan fearing for the future of their water.
 Here in Bunnan, we are not on town water but rainwater and we use our bores to feed our toilets, gardens and animals and it scares you a bit,  Bunnan resident and meeting spokesman, Dennis White said.
The process used to fracture the coal seam to release the gas, known as 'fraccing', is one issue contributing to local anxiety.
 It is that 'fraccing' and the chemicals that go down there and whether the chemicals can contaminate our water or with the 'fraccing' we lose our water,  Mr White said.
 It is the only resource we have got left out here.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"CAPITAL RAISING: Origin Energy is expected to piggyback on demand for Santos's hybrid securities and raise cash for its massive liquefied natural gas project via hybrid instruments, say analysts who continue to focus on the project's funding. Origin this week unveiled an expected $2.3 billion equity raising to pay down debt and is understood to have secured strong institutional support, with final take-up to be announced tomorrow.
But all eyes remain on how Origin will fund its share of the Australia Pacific LNG project in Queensland. Speculation was increasing the company would lean towards a ``Santos-styled hybrid note'', said Credit Suisse.
 Santos's $1.4bn hybrid issue for its Gladstone LNG project continued to trade well, which was ``a good indication of investor appetite for a similar issue from Origin,'' said Citi analyst Marie Miyashiro, who upgraded Origin to a buy.
Hybrid securities pay a fixed rate of return.
Analysts' estimates for capex costs at APLNG ranged from $17bn to $21bn, with Origin's eventual ownership stake of the project the key to the size of any additional equity issues, analysts said. Origin and partner ConocoPhillips last month sold down their stakes to 42.5 per cent each after signing a heads of agreement with China's Sinopec, which Origin yesterday indicated could soon be made binding.
But Origin chief Grant King has indicated the company could sell down further.
``The big swing factor is the level of APLNG equity selldown and at what price,'' said Credit Suisse analyst Sandra McCullagh, who expects Origin to sell down to 30 per cent.
Citi has run the numbers on a larger selldown to 27.5 per cent, which would require Origin to raise $1.45bn in additional equity to fund its share, ``most likely'' through a hybrid issue.
``A hybrid would be structurally suitable for a capital-intensive project such as APLNG, which in turn generates significant free cashflow upon commercial operation,'' said Ms Miyashiro. But Ms Miyashiro said the hybrid issue would attain only a 50 per cent equity credit from rating agencies, meaning a further $720m of equity would be required, probably through an underwritten dividend reinvestment plan ``over the next few years''.
Nomura analyst Xavier M. Grunauer, however, said Origin could come to the equity market again this year for APLNG, but tipped a combination of hybrid debt and cash as more likely.
Origin, which is in negotiations with LNG buyers, signalled it intends to give the final go-ahead to a two-train project by mid-year.
UBS analyst David Leitch said Origin provided ``increasingly confident'' signals of achieving this timetable.

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"IN a bid to reconcile the battle over coal seam gas exploration, former AgForce president John Cotter will head a new State Government committee of 22 would-be peacemakers.
Mr Cotter, a Goomeri beef producer, was appointed by Premier Bligh on Sunday to chair the Surat Basin Engagement Group (SBEG). Including community and industry representatives, mining executives, state directors-general, mayors and Water Commissioner Mary Boydell, the SBEG will try to find a way through the gas exploration minefield.
  There has never been this high a level grouping of people from across such a broad range of industry, government and community interests,  Mr Cotter said.
 The investment in CSG is worth billions, but the billions cannot come at the expense of other valuable industries. It cannot come at great cost to the rural landscape.
 Water will will be the key issue, and it has many numerous aspects. We must fully understand the impact of the gas industry on aquifers and surface water and the problems of water disposal. The solutions must come from a scientific process that gives weight to all. 
 I will be an independent chairman. There will be nowhere for participants to hide.
 The answers will have to be found from within our group.
 We have three months to form and to determine the questions we need to answer. Decisions and initiatives will roll out over the subsequent year. 
Mr Cotter dismissed questions about the challenges facing his group given the increasing number of passionate confrontations between miners and others across the Western Downs and the Surat Basin.
 We're not going to ask the protestors to stop,  he said.  It is their democratic right. 
 For local government, the provision of infrastructure is important.
 We'll look at modelling to determine the economic impact on small towns. 
 The Commonwealth stands to gain three times the revenue of the State and it will be important to determine what part the Federal Government will play - particularly when we look for help with infrastructure.
"
FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"EMOTIONS ran high at a community cabinet in Toowoomba at the weekend, as landholders voiced their fears about environmental degradation in the face of exponential and unabated expansion of the coal seam gas (CSG) industry.
Securing a balance between sustainable agriculture and resource extraction remains a key priority for AgForce, in recognition of the concerns of many members and the impact on food production.
 AgForce stands by our call for the Queensland Government to secure the future of food and protect underground water by imposing a moratorium on all CSG activities until a framework is developed to eliminate negative environmental impacts.
Premier Bligh's announcement this week of the Surat Basin Engagement Committee may be ticking the 'consultation' box, but it leaves the industry with the most at stake, agriculture, wondering when real action will occur to protect the environment and food production.
AgForce's lobbying secured us a seat at the table, with vice-president Ian Burnett joining Queensland Farmers' Federation CEO Dan Galligan as the only two farm lobby group representatives on this committee, alongside the swag of representatives from resource companies.
Primary producers should take heart that Ian and Dan, along with the landholders selected to represent local community action groups, will provide a loud and constructive voice for you.
However, it has left agriculture wondering what 'yet another committee' is really going to achieve.
It smacks of 'Yes, Minister' so we urge the government to prove they are truly committed to transparency and balance by delivering real on-the-ground results. This begins with revealing the terms of reference for the committee and providing assurances to agriculture's concerns.
Will this committee simply become the 'too-hard basket' for government?
Will the government pass on the tough issues to the committee, dust their hands, and allow the CSG juggernaut to roll on over our precious resources of land and water? Will the passion and experience of the 20-plus committee members be smothered in red tape?
The government is still unable to fully appease AgForce's concerns regarding short, medium and long-term impacts on groundwater. Again, we ask, what impacts will CSG extraction have on groundwater quality and levels, and what will be done about the negative impacts which are already occurring?
This new committee does not change the playing field, nor will AgForce ease back on our leadership on this issue.
The only way resource extraction can be allowed to continue in agriculturally productive areas is if the two industries are in balance.
There has to be scientific assurance that there will be zero impact on underground water. There has to be a ban on CSG activities in flood-prone areas to eliminate contamination.
There has to be suitable long-term financial adjustment for landholders.
There have to be assurances for landholders that their land, livestock and livelihoods will not be eroded by exploration and extraction activities.
There has to be investment of wealth back into roads and communities in the regions which are bearing the brunt of the CSG industry.
There has to be protection of strategic cropping land so farmers can continue producing sustainable food and fibre.
AgForce is rolling out information sessions in the Surat Basin to provide a critical service to all landholders impacted by CSG activities. AgForce brokered state government funding through its project division, AgForward, to ensure information is available to all landholders, free of charge.
The pilot information sessions in Dulacca, Chinchilla and Dalby at the end of March are already full, but the session at the AgForce South East regional forum in Dalby on Thursday, March 31, still has vacancies.
l Landholders are urged to express their interest in attending a session in these towns by calling (07) 3238 6048 as AgForward staff will deliver a second round if there is demand.
to meet growing global demands
We are also still awaiting the outcomes of other policy initiatives and legislative frameworks regarding issues such as strategic cropping land, and mining and resource extraction on protected areas on private lands such as nature refuges.
AgForce - through our involvement on this new committee and others - will continue to drive our members' concerns for the future of sustainable agriculture and economic strength of rural Queensland.
Until a solution is reached, landholders need access to quality, independent information to ensure they know their rights and responsibilities, and to secure fair conduct and compensation agreements with CSG companies.
In a testament to the impact CSG is having on producers in the Surat Basin,

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"A NEW approach to monitoring Coal Seam Gas impacts on groundwater across the Surat region will start from Friday. Environment and Resource Management Minister Kate Jones says Queensland's first Cumulative Management Area (CMA) will ensure petroleum and coal seam gas company activities in the region are managed as one. Ms Jones told landholders in Toowoomba the Queensland Water Commission would be the monitoring authority, responsible for groundwater flow modelling and spring management strategies within the Surat CMA.
  We are protecting landholders from finger-pointing by CSG companies,  she said.  If bores are damaged, it will be clear who is responsible for making-good.  Three-yearly underground water impact reports will be prepared by the QWC, with public consultation. The CMA covers large parts of the Surat and Bowen Basins from Goondiwindi to Emerald. It covers Dalby, Roma, St George, Miles, Wandoan, Injune, Oakey, Tara, Blackwater, Surat, Cecil Plains and other regions with CSG tenures.

FTLAND,The Land,2011,1,"KEY land will be permanently protected from mining and extraction activities under the Labor Government's 10-point coal and coal seam gas plan announced this week.
Stakeholders including farmers, Thoroughbred breeders and lobby groups welcomed elements of the policy saying there were several long-overdue initiatives ? but NSW Premier, Kristina Keneally, has provoked the ire of some by downplaying prime agricultural land.
 In a statement released by the Premier,  prime productive agricultural land  was listed after  valuable industries such as the Hunter wine industry and the Thoroughbred industry .
NSW Farmers Association president, Charles Armstrong, was quick to slam Labor's plan, saying it showed little regard for protecting critical agricultural and water resources and did little toward achieving balance between major land uses.
He said the 10-point plan would facilitate a successful coal seam gas (CSG) industry, without any place for the future of food production.
Commitments to initiatives such as exclusion zones, a coal and gas Ombudsman and audit of gas wells and drill sites were more than a decade too late and would not give farmers confidence.
Mr Armstrong said the government had missed opportunities to consult with stakeholders, in stark contrast to the Opposition.
NSW Minerals Council chief executive, Nikki Williams, said voters should be wary of  an election-driven auction of the future of the industry .
 We are deeply concerned about the proposal to introduce exclusion zones,  she said.
 Decisions must be scientific and evidence-based. 
Caroona Coal Action Group CSG spokeswoman, Rosemary Nankivell, Womboyne, said hydraulic fracturing, or  fraccing , should be banned - not just BTEX chemicals.
She said Arkansaw in the US banned fraccing on March 3 and New York recently introduced a CSG moratorium.
Mrs Nankivell also questioned how the policies would be implemented, and argued pipelines on travelling stock routes was not ideal.
She also took issue with government assertions the coal industry employed 19,000 people and pointed out agriculture employed 315,000.
 On another note, as a landholder, I object most strongly to paying my LHPA rates to cover TSRs only to find Eastern Star Gas and Santos are drilling exploration holes on them,  she added.
Thoroughbred Breeders of the Hunter Valley spokeswoman, Hellen Georgopoulos, said it was encouraging the government finally recognised the threat posed by mining to the future viability of the industry.
 We also seek the assurances of both parties they will not make decisions on new exploration or mining licences surrounding Thoroughbred breeding operations until these exclusion zones have been introduced,  Ms Georgopoulos said.
The Land requested an interview regarding the newly-released policy with NSW Planning Minister, Tony Kelly, but was told questions would only be answered by email.

FTLAND,The Land,2011,1,"THE state election will be fought on the issue of strategic land use, not the looming carbon tax, according to Caroona Coal Action Group (CCAG) spokesman and Independent candidate, Tim Duddy (pictured). The Land asked Mr Duddy,  Rossmar Park , Caroona, to respond to Labor's 10-point coal and coal seam gas plan announced this week.
1. Ban exploration activities in waterways adjoining national parks and wind back exploration licences from other sensitive areas.
 TD: What on God's earth is a sensitive area? Sounds warm and fuzzy but need details.
2. Ban the use of BTEX chemicals in coal seam gas operations.
TD: Banning BTEX is a great thing. But if they are planning to develop a coal seam gas industry, I am not sure how they think they are going to do it without the use of chemicals to facilitate the movement of gas, and the industry will put a lot of weight on ? it will be a lot of work and hard to enforce.
3. Introduce exclusion zones to assist strategic land use planning.
TD: Fully agree with the concept of exclusion but prime agricultural land is a distant third and that is just absolute crap. It should be first and foremost. The concern is once again there is no mention of water. That's the terrifying thing, that's what everybody is missing. The nationals overlooked water too, no-one is keen to touch it.
4. Appoint three additional regional planning compliance officers to ensure industry best practice standards are maintained ? bringing the number to six.
TD: What a joke ? we have a multi-billion dollar industry with just three compliance officers and they are taking it to six when the current wait time after a complaint is lodged is months. It's ridiculous.
5. Conduct an audit of gas wells and drill sites across NSW to examine how operators have complied with conditions of approval for their exploration licences and operational wells.
TD: A really, really good thing, long overdue.
6. Introduce new exploration protocols with increased minimum payments for exploration and productive wells to guide coal seam gas industry practice regarding the use of farming lands.
TD: How on God's earth are they going to do that? Through public consultation? Through industry? An inquiry? Once again, a nice warm, fuzzy idea.
7. Provide state guidelines to assist councils negotiate contributions from mining companies.
TD: Absolutely essential. There needs to be protocols in place. If you have a pro-active council such as Muswellbrook you get enormous returns, but if you get councils that are not into doing that, then the entire community misses out on benefits.
8. Appoint a Coal and Gas Ombudsman to investigate and respond to complaints related to mining and exploration and extraction activities.
TD: Fantastic, a very important thing.
9. Ensure future approvals for gas pipelines are conditional on being located on public land corridors and travelling stock routes to avoid agricultural land.
TD: Travelling Stock Routes are ON agricultural land, that is why they are stock routes; don't agree with putting them on stock routes at all.
10. Establish new state rehabilitation awards to recognise excellence in returning mining lands to their natural state.
TD: All I can say is good luck with that one, because there would not be enough money in state coffers, or the entire industry, to repair the damage that has already been done, let alone future damage.

FTLAND,The Land,2011,1,"MORE than 2000 people gathered to celebrate life on the Liverpool Plains at Caroona on Sunday, where mouth-watering offerings ranging from Wagyu burgers to roast duck and caramelized onion tartlets complemented a great line-up of speakers and light-hearted entertainment.
The second annual Taste of the Liverpool Plains aimed to showcase the agricultural value of a region that landholders say is under threat from coal mining and coal seam gas drilling ? but it also highlighted a vibrant, diverse and united rural community.
 A range of fine food and wine was on offer along with a wide variety of take-home produce.
Highlights included a natural fibre fashion show created by Calrossy Anglican School, bush poet Sandy Cudmore, country singer Dan Murphy, and a thought-provoking speech by author and environmentalist, Julian Cribb.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"For all the debate over which of Australia's liquefied natural gas players represents the best investment, it pays to remember that only Woodside Petroleum is already producing LNG on a significant scale.
So it's Woodside that's in the box seat to benefit most from the short-term surge in LNG demand stemming from the Japanese earthquake and nuclear crisis.
 A detailed analysis from international energy consultants Wood Mackenzie illustrates the opportunity for Woodside.
The consultants compared the current situation in Japan with the shutdown of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant following another Japanese earthquake in July 2007.
In that instance, Wood Mackenzie notes, Japan turned to oil to make up 71 per cent of the lost power generation during the plant's 12-month shutdown. LNG took care of 21 per cent.
This time, Wood Mackenzie expects LNG to satisfy 40 per cent of the generation shortfall stemming from nuclear shutdowns, with the extra demand equating to 5.5 million tonnes a year of LNG, or over six standard-size LNG cargoes a month.
Driving the change is the oversupply of LNG in the region, coupled with the gap between LNG and oil prices.
Given the emerging dynamics in Japan, it may be a gap that shrinks quite quickly.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have separately unveiled new global production growth targets that rely heavily on a new wave of liquefied natural gas investments in Australia.
The projects will get the go-ahead over the next three years.
 The new developments, worth tens of billions of dollars, include what may be the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) project, an expansion of the $43 billion Gorgon project under construction in Western Australia and Shell's first coal seam gas-based project in Queensland.
Shell and Chevron are key players in Australia's rapidly growing LNG sector, along with more recent entrants such as PetroChina and France's Total, all keen to access energy-hungry markets in Asia.
Gas demand in Asia is already growing more rapidly than in Europe or North America.
It is now expected to get a major boost from the nuclear power station crisis which followed last week's earthquake and tsunami in Japan, with analysts forecasting slower construction of new reactors and accelerated closures of older plants.
Up to 50 million tonnes per year of additional LNG demand is likely to be required by 2020 as nuclear plants are suspended or delayed, Bernstein Research estimates.
Shell chief executive Peter Voser told investors in London late Tuesday the company could add 11 million tonnes per year of LNG production capacity in Australia by 2020, in addition to projects already under construction, including the Gorgon venture and Pluto, through its stake in Woodside.
The Anglo-Dutch major is set to increase LNG supply capacity from its end-2010 total of 18.2 million tonnes a year by 42 per cent through five new production trains, including three at Gorgon and one at Pluto, as well as one in Qatar.
Next to reach a final investment decision will be the Prelude FLNG project in the Browse Basin, set to cost up to $10 billion and which Mr Voser said should proceed this year.
Meanwhile, Shell's Arrow Energy project with PetroChina in Queensland should move into the front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase this year, he said. While Mr Voser wouldn't give a date for a final investment decision in Arrow, it has previously signalled a date of 2012 or 2013.
An expansion at Gorgon, the controversial Sunrise venture in the Timor Sea and the Woodside-operated Browse LNG project in Australia's far northwest would also contribute to Shell's 2020 target.
Chevron, meanwhile, has revealed a goal of 2013 to sanction an expansion of the $US37 billion Gorgon project to add a fourth production train, with a fifth likely to follow. FEED work on the fourth train should start next year, it said.
But the expansion plan has already raised a storm of protest among environmentalists that also opposed the construction of the first phase of the giant project on the Barrow Island nature reserve off the northwest coast.
Shell, 25 per cent owner of Gorgon, was also less confident of the expansion.
 We need to deliver first what we have under construction there, then we will look at possibilities to enhance that,  Mr Voser said.
Despite speculation that construction of the first phase of Gorgon, involving three 5 million tonnes per year LNG units, is running behind schedule, Chevron confirmed both the 2014 start-up date and the budget.
James Blackwell, executive vice president, upstream and gas at Chevron, also confirmed Chevron's second major Australian LNG project, Wheatstone, is set to go ahead later this year.
The two projects should propel Chevron up the global rankings of LNG players, leapfrogging BG, ExxonMobil and others to become the world's fourth-biggest producer, up from its current top 20 ranking.
Chevron's projects in the Asia-Pacific region  will be among the most important investments for this company over the next 10 years , Mr Blackwell said
 These investments are a key part of our project queue and will lead the way for Chevron's growth and long-term revenue generation into the future decades. 
Chevron is forecasting a 20 per cent jump in its production by 2017 to 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, including 500,000 boe from Gorgon and Wheatstone.
LNG investments will account for about $US6 billion of Chevron's 2011 capex budget of about $US26 billion. The US company has yet to reveal a budget for Wheatstone, to be built at Ashburton North near Onslow, but analysts estimate the cost at more than $20 billion.
Production at Wheatstone, in which Apache, Kuwait's Kufpec and LNG buyers from Japan and Korea have stakes, is due to begin in 2016.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"AFTER dark it has always been a bit of a minefield but, by day, Fortitude Valley is now a corporate headquarters for Queensland's burgeoning $30 billion coal seam gas industry.
Global engineering and construction giant Bechtel has staked its claim in the precinct on the edge of Brisbane's CBD.
 It now occupies about 21,400sq m of office space in four buildings after committing to 4000sq m at 515 St Paul's Tce in a leasing deal worth almost $2 million a year.
But industry sources claim the US-based company is scouting for a further 3000-4000sq m.
It is understood Bechtel is still exploring its options but has already looked at several properties, including 45 Commercial Rd, Newstead.
Jones Lang LaSalle's Don Mackenzie, who negotiated the latest deal with colleague Tom Barr, said the St Paul's Tce space was required for a coal seam gas venture.
``It's another boon for the Brisbane fringe market,'' Mr Mackenzie said.
``But the opportunities for large, fitted-out contiguous spaces (above 2000sq m) are diminishing at a rapid rate within the market.
``At the beginning of 2010 there would have been at least 10 options but this has since reduced to only a few.''
Bechtel's other commitments in the Valley include its 4590sq m head office in the two-tower HQ development at 540 Wickham St, 9700sq m at 100 Brookes St and 3057sq m at 518 Brunswick St.
Mr Mackenzie said that during the past two years Jones Lang LaSalle research had forecast the coal seam gas industry would drive significant demand for commercial property in the Brisbane market.
``The four major groups in coal seam gas sector, led by Santos, BG Group, Shell/Arrow Energy and Origin Energy, have expanded from around 17,000sq m in the Brisbane office market a couple of years ago to now occupy more than 54,000sq m,'' he said.
``However, the sector has now well and truly moved into the next phase and is creating big new project requirements for consultants such as WorleyParsons and Bechtel.''
Jones Lang LaSalle managing director Geoff McIntyre said the firm estimated the total impact of the sector on Brisbane office space requirements during the next decade could be as much as 30,000sq m a year.
``Even if demand ends up at half of this level, it will have a significant impact on the Brisbane office market,'' he said.
Mr McIntyre said two projects, led by Santos and BG Group, had been given final investment approval to proceed with the first stage of each project, which would result in more than $30 billion of assured investment in the state.
"
AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Woodside Petroleum's closely watched quest to shore up enough gas resources to proceed this year with an expansion of its $14 billion Pluto liquefied natural gas project has taken a leap forward with a potentially significant find.
The Martin 1 well found gas over a depth of about 100 metres in the wholly owned WA-404-P permit, close to five other discoveries, Woodside reported yesterday.
 The size of the find sparked optimism that Woodside's intensive exploration campaign in the Carnarvon Basin is close to delivering sufficient resources to proceed with the Pluto expansion without relying on gas from other companies.
 This discovery looks very good; 100 metres of gas is not a small accumulation,  said Andrew Williams, an oil and gas analyst at RBC, who suggested the deposit might hold between 1 and 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas.  If they're not there already for Pluto 2, they're pretty close. 
Woodside shares yesterday gained 2.1 per cent to $42.85.
Woodside is relying on success at Martin 1 and at the next well, Xeres 1 in the WA-34-L permit, to be able to order long lead items about mid-year for the expansion of the Pluto LNG project nearing completion on the Burrup Peninsula.
Woodside chief executive Don Voelte said last month he was  pretty certain  of finding gas at Martin 1 and that he would be  disappointed  if it came up dry. Drilling at the well was delayed earlier this year by interruptions caused by a tropical cyclone.
The company had hoped to proceed with Pluto 2 at the end of last year, but had to defer the date for a final investment decision to the end of 2011, with start-up targeted for late 2014.
Woodside's exploration program has now yielded seven discoveries out of 11 wells drilled so far in the inner and central hub areas of the Carnarvon Basin that were targeting gas for Pluto 2. Another six exploration and appraisal wells are planned in the area this year.
The latest find lies within 14 kilometres of the earlier discoveries in WA-404-P, including Martell, Noblige, Larsen, Larsen Deep and Remy. Woodside also found gas at the Eris 1 well, which lies closer to the original Pluto offshore field.
RBS estimates that Woodside needs to find between 2 trillion and 3 trillion cubic feet of gas in WA-404-P to put together with other gas in the Pluto area to underpin a second LNG train at the project.
According to a drilling schedule outlined by Woodside last month, the next wells to be drilled in the Carnarvon area are the lower parts of two wells near the Laverda oil field off the North-West Cape.
The Maersk Discoverer drill-rig will then return to the Pluto gas hunt with the Xeres well, the Kelt exploration well in WA-404-P and several appraisal wells in the same permit.
Mr Voelte last month voiced confidence about the chances of success at Xeres but described Kelt as a  rank exploration  prospect.
The WA-404-P permit was previously managed as a 50-50 venture between Woodside and Hess, before Woodside bought out its US partner last October.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Corporate Australia's exposure to the crises unfolding in Japan is growing, as raw material exporters, retailers and property trusts seek to measure the cost of the disaster.
Energy companies are the most affected; uranium miners and explorers were smashed lower again as the situation at the Fukushima reactor worsened, but Australian exporters of coal and liquified natural gas stand to benefit from any move away from nuclear energy.
 Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder said thermal coal markets could be an obvious beneficiary given current demands for electricity.  It has probably put a question mark on some of the nuclear power plants, so you'd think in the short to medium term the one thing that won't change is demand for energy,  Mr Goyder said.
Liquefied natural gas companies such as Woodside, Santos, Oil Search and Origin Energy might benefit as spot prices rise in line with demand for energy to replace nuclear plants.
Origin's efforts to lock in long-term LNG sales contracts for its Gladstone coal seem gas project could receive a major boost if the parties believe that Japan will reduce its nuclear capacity and replace it with LNG.
Rolling power blackouts across the northeast of Japan and throughout Tokyo have left the industry in a state of flux, with iron ore and coal miners still waiting to see if Japanese metal producers would need to cut production in response to electricity shortages. Recent settlements for iron ore inputs have been heading to record levels in advance of the earthquake and tsunami last week but Goldman Sachs said iron ore spot prices would continue to come under pressure if Japanese steel producers remain out of action.
Japan's Sumitomo Metal Industries is the only steelmaker to stop making raw steel, but Nippon Steel has suffered damage at a rerolling plant in the country's northeast. Rio Tinto supplies the bulk of iron ore to Sumitomo's Kashima plant, where two furnaces have been idled and BHP Billiton is dominant in the supply of coking coal to Japan. But a source at one of Japan's biggest steelmakers said yesterday that operations are continuing as normal, with no plans to cut production or exports.
Electric arc furnace producers are suffering worse than their blast furnace counterparts, however, with scrap input feed said to be contaminated by radiation.
Information service Steel Business Briefing said up to 30 million tonnes â€“ or roughly 30 per cent â€“ of Japanese steel production could be eliminated because of power problems and damage sustained to plants.
The effects are not limited to commodity exports, however. Department store chain Myer said a downturn in tourism from Japan could affect sales at its Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast stores, but it did not expect a significant impact. Much worse affected is surfwear brand Billabong, which downgraded profit guidance by 2 per cent to 6 per cent this week after five of its stores were destroyed in the weekend's disaster.
Rubber products group Ansell may, however, benefit from a slump in the price of latex on concerns about Japan's car and tyre manufacturing industries. Latex prices have doubled in the past year but Ansell has only recouped half that in price increases for its gloves and condoms and plans to retain any gains from a 15 per cent fall in the latex price this week.
Investors have retreated from woodchip exporter Gunns on concerns the disaster would lead to softer demand for paper products in Japan, despite assurances from management that sales are continuing to regions outside the quake-ravaged provinces.
Australian Agricultural Company is still assessing whether it might benefit from the disaster. Australia's biggest beef producer was unclear whether Japanese cattle farms had been destroyed. But there are also fears that demand could suffer and prices weaken in the short term.
Rice growers also reckon it is too early to tell what impact the disaster would have on demand for imports â€“ Japan is usually self sufficient but farms may have been destroyed.
Wheat exporter PrimeAg may see a downturn in wheat prices even though it does not export much to Japan in the event of a collapse in demand.
Uranium companies have been the hardest hit. China has put approvals for new plants on hold while Germany is temporarily shutting seven plants. Explorer Mantra Resources' shares slumped by 28.7 per cent to $4.77 after Russia's JSC Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ) tried to back away from a scheme of arrangement that would have seen the Russian company pay $8 a share.
Japan-exposed real estate investment trusts Astro Japan and Galileo Japan both said they were not expecting any significant damage from the disaster but had yet to undertake detailed engineering studies to confirm the structure of their buildings had not suffered.  A full engineering review has not been undertaken and this may take several weeks to complete,  Galileo said.
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster transport and ports remain blocked and thermal coal users have declared force majeure on their contracts while they wait for infrastructure to be restored.
GSJBW analyst Malcolm Southwood said ports within a 440km radius of the earthquake handled 46 million tonnes of coal and 50 million tonnes of iron ore in 2010.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"Keerrong residents fearful of environmental damage
CHRIS ALLEN'S transformation into a political activist will be complete today when he takes part in a rally against coal seam gas mining to be held in Lismore.
 The horse enthusiast who has lived in the Keerrong Valley for 31 years said that prior to learning about the potentially devastating effects coal seam mining could have on the environment he would never have described himself as political.
However, all that changed when an exploration well was drilled opposite his property on Terania Creek.
â€œIt just turned up, we weren't asked,â€? Mr Allen said.
He then decided to find out more about the coal seam gas industry by watching the film GasLand, which documents the industries activities in the United States.
â€œWe were told (by the Australian industry) that what happened on GasLand couldn't happen here, but that's not true. It is already happening here in Queensland,â€? Mr Allen said.
Keerrong Gas Squad member and one of the organisers oftoday's rally, Ian Gaillard, said the activities of the coal seam gasindustry should be of concern to all farmers and members of the community.
â€œIt's an issue about future water quality and water is life,â€? Mr Gaillard said.
â€œEven if they say they don't use dangerous chemicals, the process of fraccing itself releases heavy metals and toxic substances from the coal beds.â€?
The industry had been given the green light by government to conduct drilling activities before it was known whether their activities were safe, he said.
â€œIf these companies are so sure their activities are safe where is the fully-paid water quality andsecurity insurance policy to guarantee our clean water supply for farmers and householders?â€? Mr Gaillard asked.
Mr Gaillard said the only safe course of action was a total ban on coal seam gas mining.
Anyone interested in participating in the rally should meet on the corner of Carrington and Conway streets. The rally will proceed around the block and will go around the block and finish inMagellan St.
Dr Marion Lloyd-Smith, from the National Toxics Network and who was featured on a recent Four Corners program on coal seam gas mining, will speak, along with members of the Keerrong Gas Squad.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"THE Fukushima nuclear calamity and the escalating obscenity of its cloistered mismanagement by the Tokyo Electric Power Company has led to a knee-jerk reaction around the globe.
The nuclear power game is over, uranium mining will follow it into the industrial history books, coal is suddenly back in town and natural gas, well, it is even hotter now that it has ever been before.
 These are all, in varying degrees, apparently reasonable conclusions to draw from the collected inputs of Japan's disasters that started with last week's massive earthquake.
But the longer realities are likely to be very different indeed.
Because, no matter how they are realigned in the short term by the powerful currency of Fukushima, the economic and political tectonics of power generation and its fuel sources, and the coincident pressures of climate change and carbon emission mitigation, create a vastly more complicated matrix than the two-minute experts seem to want to believe.
Certainly, Fukushima represents a miserable milestone in the nuclear industry's march to legitimacy, but that long march will continue if only because energy-hungry nations like China, India and France and, yes, even currently doubtful Germany have so few other solutions to their load power needs.
Yes, yes, I know China says it has suspended its $150 billion nuclear program while one of Europe's leading nuke-dependent nations, Germany, has temporarily closed seven of its pre-1980 reactors and indicated something of a change of heart on her government's move to overturn a previous government's timetable for the
Continued on Page 28
Continued from Page 25
deactivation of all 17 of the nation's nuclear power plants.
But, for quite different reasons, it seems to me that neither nation can resist the nuclear tide over the long haul.
On her election in 2009, German Chancellor Angela Merkel ditched the previous coalition government's plans to both close Germany's existing nuclear plants and legislate against any further being built.
China, on the other hand, is not quite so much concerned about climate change and carbon efficiency, and it is about diversifying its sources of electricity generation as it attempts to provide the fundamentals for its broadening economic revolution. And no one has been talking about India, which is committed to a 20-year, $US175 billion plan to double its nuclear power supply.
To that end, the economics of nuclear power are interesting. In very simple terms, the nuclear plants themselves cost an absolute bomb (pun quite intended) to build but not very much at all to run.
Unlike, say, gas, the other contender in the chase for a fuel that is both able to fire power stations and yet has an acceptable carbon footprint, uranium is priced on its own supply and demand economics. Export gas prices move with the oil price and you only have to look at the gyrations of oil in the wake of the instability in the Gulf to appreciate why China, et al, might seek to broaden the portfolio of their fuel bases.
As The Australian reported yesterday, China has plans to build 27 of the 62 new nuclear power stations planned around the world currently.
Now, while China certainly has announced to an edgy populous that it will review the work done so far on its rollout of power plants, no one really believes the stasis will hold.
As Morningstar's senior research analyst, Mark Taylor, observed so pithily yesterday: ``In the longer term, whether Japan's reactors end up getting the tick of approval or sharp thumbs down is unlikely to radically alter the growth in numbers of nuclear reactors elsewhere and particularly in China.
``Countries non-self-sufficient in energy will always want a diversified portfolio and there just aren't that many alternatives.
``The Japanese disaster might result in some delays to approvals and some re-engineering and increase in reactor costs. ``But it might even accelerate development of nuclear power if the disaster ends up highlighting nuclear's safety, even if that might now seem counter-intuitive.''
All that said, there is one outcome tipped by the instant seers that will doubtless prove accurate and that is that the trauma at Fukushima will end any talk that Australia might embrace a nuclear future. Australia, of course, does not sit among the ranks of the under-resourced when it comes to energy, so we have a wider range of sustainable choices here than just about any other nation. Mind you, we would seem to be a peculiarly safe home for nuclear power plants given than uranium-rich Australia is also one of the most geologically stable environments in the world (earthquakes and tsunamis are very rare events indeed).
It is hard though not to wince at the irrational paradox of our resistance to nuclear power and the Julia Gillard decision to lock us into a carbon tax (with a carbon emissions trading scheme to follow) as the central plank of Australia's drive to reduce our climate changing carbon footprint.
To a significant degree, the big end of Australian business reckons that, in attempting to put a price on carbon, Gillard has put her government in gruesome lock-step both with the pre-GFC climate politics and with old Labor's long-standing obsession with ideas of wealth redistribution funded by corporate taxation.
In the end, the attraction of carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes is not that they redraft the market efficiencies of carbon emissions but rather that they raise a whole heap of money than can then be doled out as they see fit. So it is that we have Ross Garnaut suggesting that half the carbon tax cash should be committed to cuts in personal income tax for low and middle income earners. How that mitigates carbon emissions, I am not so sure.
But it makes for good politics when it comes to the selling of an ugly tax to a vulnerable voting population.
The big problem though for Gillard is Australia's commitment to pricing carbon is not going to be matched by a host of our trading partners, most obviously the US and China. The US has effectively decided that it cannot raise a tax because, essentially, the electorate will not let it. So the only way it can go is to regulate emissions. And if that is the path the US takes, then China will follow.
Which leaves us with two carbon worlds, the Euro-Garnaut world (where big government raises money and doles our to the worthy and the needy) and the US world (where there is outcomes focused regulation).
Not surprisingly, given the consequences for trade-exposed Australian industry, there is some considerable support among senior corporates for a more pragmatic response to the climate challenge than the tax-to-trading scheme process Gillard is proposing. No one seriously questions, for example, that the repricing of domestic power is essential to driving changes in consumption patterns, nor that the impact of that repricing on households would need to be mitigated by government. But there are grave doubts about the sustainability of a tax that might hit all industry equally.
To understand why, consider plucky BlueScope. It is a steelmaker efficient by global standards by whatever measure you want to use, including carbon emissions.
But with no shielding, at the mid-point of Garnaut's range ($25 cost per tonne) the carbon tax would cost it $315m million a year for scope one and two emissions.
With scope three costs from suppliers on top of that, the total could be as high as $400m, again assuming no shielding).
The government insists, of course, that the competitiveness of the likes of BlueScope and OneSteel (both of which compete with importers for the domestic market), will be sustained as part of its industry compensation plans.
But BlueScope reckons it is not a question of seeking compensation but rather a case of not wanting to be subject to a unilateral, domestic, punitive tax on local manufacturing that favours foreign manufacturers and their exports to Australia.
BlueScope's view is that it doesn't want to add any burden until its global competitors face comparable costs.
And given the US sticks on its regulation rather than taxation path, then that might be a long time coming.
It should be remembered that steelmakers actually have very limited scope to reduce carbon emissions because they are an inevitable product of the chemical reaction in making steel.
So we will end up taxing domestic production and giving a free kick to imports for absolutely no environmental gain.

SMHH,The Sydney Morning Herald,2011,1,"WE'D better be getting serious about massive wind and solar, because the alternatives are narrowing. Forget nuclear here, anywhere near anybody. Carbon capture and storage? Yeah, sure. Coal-seam gas? Highly problematic. Geothermal? Hmm.
On Thursday, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she was looking at whether the  renewables age  could be brought on sooner and in Australia, the Greens leader, Bob Brown, pounced.  We need to, sensibly, go straight to renewables,  he said.  They're safe, they're great job creators, and the power source is free. 
 Everyone seems down on wind farms at the moment - they're not powerful enough, they're unsightly, they're even unhealthy! (Caution: excessive anxiety about the value of your property is bad for you.)
The failing renewable energy target regime and a Victorian government elected on an anti-wind platform are not helping, but weather permitting, today the first of a pair of two-megawatt turbines in the community-funded Hepburn Wind project is being raised at Leonards Hill, near Daylesford and Hepburn Springs, in central Victoria.
The 1600 members of Hepburn Wind are expecting commercial returns on their collective $8.7 million investment, but a director, Simon Holmes a Court, says the primary drivers are reducing the town's carbon footprint and  making the statement that we're impatient and are just getting on with it .
 We're not cutting cable to the network,  he says.  But when it's up and going we'll be a net exporter to the grid. On a windy day we'll be putting out far more power than our community uses. 
A non-profit group, Embark, is extending the Hepburn model, working with more than 40 communities for small wind, solar or micro-hydro projects. Armidale, in the NSW northern tablelands, is next.
 There's no reason why we couldn't have them in cities,  Holmes a Court says.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG SYDNEY, March 20 AAP - Several hundred people have gathered in central Sydney to protest against the mining of coal seam gas in NSW.
The protesters are concerned about the environmental effects of the CSG industry in norther NSW, claiming the state's water supply and farming soil could become contaminated and potentially impact on food supply.
 Among those present at the demonstration on Sunday, held during heavy rain and strong winds at Martin Place, was campaigner Linda Benson from Gloucester on the NSW north coast.
Ms Benson wore a bra with black coal marks smeared across her chest and a sign saying  Keep our lungs free .
 It's not just about us, the people who live in areas where this is done, it's about our children, our children's children and generations to come,  she told AAP.
Others carried banners reading  Coal seam gas? No fracking way . Fracking is a mining technique used to recover CSG.
Dozens of those present had arrived in Sydney on buses and coaches from the Hunter Valley and the NSW mid-north coast.
Independent federal MP Rob Oakeshott called for the next NSW government to review a planning decision to allow 110 CSG wells to be drilled in his electorate of Lyne, on the north coast.
Mr Oakeshott said about 50,000 water users downstream of the proposed wells did not have a voice during the planning stage.
 There are significant holes in the planning process that I would hope an incoming state government will use as a trigger to review the decision,  he told AAP.
After a series of speeches, the protesters marched to the state government's offices at Governor Phillip Tower in Farrer Place.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG By Petrina Berry
BRISBANE, March 21 AAP - The controversial coal seam gas (CSG) industry is expanding to townships in western Queensland, with Longreach landholders receiving drilling notices.
 Australian-based oil and gas company Exoma Energy has sent notices to Longreach residents of its plans to drill exploratory gas wells on their properties.
Exoma Energy plans to start drilling 21 wells in the Barcaldine, Longreach and Winton area in May.
Farmers and environmentalists have formed an unusual alliance in the Darling Downs west of Brisbane to oppose CSG extraction over fears it could have major environmental and health impacts.
Peak Queensland farmers group AgForce says CSG projects are multiplying across the state despite a lack of research into the affect it will have on groundwater, the environment, livestock and humans.
AgForce spokesman Drew Wagner said in the past several months CSG permits had been popping up in Quilpie, Charleville, Tambo, Blackall, Barcaldine and Longreach.
 We have massive concerns about CSG's impact on groundwater and other issues, but this industry seems to be expanding ... almost unabated,  Mr Wagner said.
He said currently there are 3500 wells across Queensland with plans for a total of 40,000.
The Wilderness Society is calling for a moratorium on the CSG industry and an independent study into its impact on groundwater and the environment.
The society's spokesman Glenn Walker says CSG projects near the Cooper Creek Catchment in Longreach could have devastating impacts on the environment.
Mr Walker said chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing of coal seams to release gas could contaminate underground water and the extraction of water could lower the water table.
 CSG's use of fraccing chemicals and the extraction of water from aquifers could affect a number of species dependent on groundwater, in particular plants,  he said.
 Some farmers in those areas depend on bores for their cattle so the groundwater impact could be significant, particularly if you have thousands of wells in the area.
 When they pull out the water from the wells it's generally salty and could contain heavy metals, including toxic hydrocarbons, from the rocks it's had to pass through.
 There is still no clarity from the industry how this waste water will be dealt with. 
Mr Walker said traditionally the water is pumped into evaporation ponds but he fears heavy rains could result in those ponds overflowing and spilling poisons into river systems.
Exoma Energy chief executive Rob Crook says these were unfounded concerns.
 We won't have an impact on groundwater and that side of the industry is heavily regulated,  Mr Crook told AAP.
 People have the right to be concerned but they need to be concerned about the right things.
 We wouldn't be allowed by government to pollute the rivers and groundwater, and not that we would. 
Several hundred people rallied in central Sydney on Saturday against CSG, and farmers and environmentalists are staging a blockade on the Darling Downs to stop the Queensland Gas Company's CSG project.
Exoma Energy has five petroleum exploration permits situated over the Galilee Basin in western Queensland and the Eromanga Basin in South Australia.

AAPBLT,AAP Bulletins,2011,1,"Fitch Ratings says the accident at the Fukujima nuclear power plant could lead to a boost in Japanese demand for Australian thermal coal.
Fitch also says increased Japanese demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) could support additional LNG trains at the Browse and Pluto basins, both offshore from northwest Western Australia.
 Electricity would be met by coal and fuel oil-fired generation in the short term as Japanese gas-fired plants possessed little spare capacity, Fitch said.
 Japanese gas-fired electricity generators were operating at high capacity prior to the earthquake and have limited ability to further increase production,  Fitch director of energy and utilities Arnon Musiker said.
 This will limit the increase in demand for spot LNG cargoes. 
Fitch estimates Japan lost 11 gigaWatts of nuclear-fired baseload energy after an earthquake and tsunami that sent Japan's nuclear reactors offline.
The ratings agency said on Monday that gas-fired power was a  natural substitute  for nuclear power in the medium term due to its relatively low carbon emission intensity and speed of construction.
 Fitch believes that Japanese utilities will seek to maintain a policy of diversifying gas supply, which could result in sufficient support for one to two new LNG trains in Australia. 
The replacement of Onagawa, Fukushima, Daichi and Daini nuclear reactors with gas-fired generation could increase LNG demand by nine million tonnes per annum, Fitch said.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd's Pluto LNG project in WA and Origin Energy's joint venture Asia-Pacific project in the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland were likely to benefit, subject to securing gas reserves.
 Moreover, the Japanese LNG import network appears to have spare capacity for additional imports, and was reported as undamaged by the International Energy Agency after the earthquake and subsequent tsunami,  Fitch said.
Several countries have announced a review of planned nuclear generators, including China.
Fitch says one additional LNG train would be required for every five gigaWatts of nuclear generation capacity that is replaced by gas.
 If the outcome of the reviews leads to widespread cancellation of new nuclear capacity, there could be sufficient demand for Australian LNG to support those projects that are not yet fully contracted,  Mr Musiker said.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"More than 1,000 people from across the state have gathered in Sydney to protest against coal mining and coal seam gas exploration.
Local farmers and environmental groups were among those calling for the State Government and Opposition to introduce tighter controls on the mining industry during the rally at Martin Place yesterday.
 The Chief Executive of the Nature Conservation Council, Pepe Clarke, says Independent and Greens candidates addressed the crowd, but the two major parties did not attend.
He says Labor and the Coalition have left it too late to properly tackle mining policy.
 The policies announced by Labor and the Coalition are both important signs of progress,  he said.
 In the case of the Labor policy, they have had 16 years to deal with these problems and to announce proposed changes in policy just days before the election, really for most mine affected communities, is too little too late. 
The organisers of the rally say the turnout shows the depth of concern about the potential impacts of coal mining and coal seam gas exploration in New South Wales.
The Nature Conservation Council, which hosted the protest, is among a number of groups which wants a moratorium on new coal seam gas exploration projects, until more research is done.
Mr Clarke says the Coalition and Labor's mining policies must be guided by public consultation.
 Both of the major parties have indicated that the strategic planning process is needed to determine which areas might be excluded from mining and gas activities.
 But, a strategic planning process ultimately is only as good as the strategic plan that you get at the end.
 So, there's a very real need for people with concerns about these issues to stay involved in the process.

The Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW) has revealed it is preparing to ramp-up scrutiny of the fledgling resource industry because of public concern especially in areas like the Hunter Valley.
 Deputy Director-General of the department's Environment Protection and Regulation Group, Greg Sullivan now has officers who are part of the application processing system.
 Following the announcement of the Government in late-December that they were going to strengthen environmental oversight of exploration wells, we are now assessing applications referred from the Department of Industry and Investment,  Mr Sullivan said.
 Our initial observation has been that they need to get more information into them, so we have given that message to Industry, put all the information in so we can make proper assessments. 
The NSW Government will receive a report within months from the environment protection regulator on the controversial process used to access coal seam gas reserves.
Coal seam fracturing, also known as 'fraccing', is one of the issues DECCW has learnt more about in recent discussions with regulators of the Queensland gas industry.
 We are looking at when these coal seam gas companies want to use fracturing,  Mr Sullivan said.
 We are infact leading a working group that is exploring the banning of what are called BTEX chemicals, in both drilling and fracturing,

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"Hundreds march through Lismore streets to oppose coal seam exploration
PROTEST action against coal seam gas exploration stepped up a notch when 400 concerned people marched through Lismore to voice their objections on Saturday.
 The target of their dissent was the perceived threat to the environment when miners' drills fracture the aquifer layers â€“ known as â€œfraccingâ€? â€“ using a range of chemicals and the poisoning of water supplies.
The mining companies' â€œdishonesty and sneakinessâ€? were also causing community anger, protesters said.
The demonstration â€“ the first of what was promised as many of its kind â€“ was organised by the Keerrong Gas Squad, and supported by large numbers of people from the Kyogle, Casino, Nimbin and Lismore areas.
Green activists and farmers, who have been united by the issue, were joined on Saturday by small block-holders, retirees and extendedfamilies, including at least one great-grandmother, Joyce Allen, aged 83.
Mrs Allen and many other pro-testers had never been on such a march before. It was also a first for Betty and Doug Gregg, who have two hectares at Jiggi.
â€œThis is bringing out people who have never protested,â€? Ms Gregg said. â€œMost people are ignorant about it, but once it's happened it will be too late. It's terrifying.
â€œI just wish the companies would be honest about the chemicals they're using and the leaks. We've seen the leaks for ourselves and it's obvious that something is wrong.â€?
The marchers were addressed by Mariann Lloyd-Smith, of the National Toxics Network, who called for a moratorium on coal gas seam mining.
â€œWe have been lied to. The chemicals used are not food grade â€“ they contain carcinogens and reproductive toxins.â€?
She said only two of the 23 chemicals used in the drilling had been assessed by national regulators, and more than seven tonnes of them would be left in the ground at every well site.
Another speaker said the mining would remove a large chunk of geology, causing leaching between aquifers.
â€œThis is the monster in the room. It's a blueprint for the destruction of sweet water across our planet,â€? they said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"'They will get more sympathy if they can explain how it threatens all of us and not just their own way of life'
SHOULD we feel solidarity for the folk out at Tara, west of Toowoomba, who have been trying to stop coal-seam gas companies from coming on to their properties?
 What about the low-rise residents of West End objecting to the appearance of tall apartment blocks in their midst?
Should we cheer on the members of the Save Greenbank community action group, which is trying to stop Urban Land Development Authority plans for a nearby medium-density residential development south of Brisbane ?
Each example is different but they share one thing in common - the complaining parties feel their chosen way of life is being damaged by someone else's actions. Instinctively, most of us would probably side with the party being disturbed. After all, they were just sitting there minding their own business until someone came along to annoy them.
And it is happening to more and more of us.
The nice old gent next door dies, his family sells out to a developer who clears the block and the next thing you know you're living 1.5m away from a monstrosity.
Or the State Government decides the answer to years of inaction is to spend billions of dollars on new tunnels and tollways. Overnight, you're living in a dead-end street and facing years of dodging big, dirt-hauling trucks.
And so, should we side with the underdog, the aggrieved party in the examples above or any other examples you can think of? My short answer is no, for a couple of reasons.
The first is that nothing stays the same and that fear of change is often much worse than the change itself.
While the ULDA talks of ``sustainable communities that offer housing affordability, diversity and choice'', catering for everyone from millionaires to people who cannot afford to buy their own place, the Save Greenbank website warns of ``a massive increase'' in ``crime, graffiti, hoons, housing commission homes''.
Both sides might be egging the pudding. The reality is perhaps something less than the ULDA's vision of compact, harmonious little villages but surely something more than a crime-breeding housing commission estate.
The second reason I'm finding it harder to support the little guys is that all too often self-interest, rather than any particular question of equity
or fairness, seems to be the motivating factor.
The people of Greenbank don't want any threat to their rural lifestyle or their property values; the denizens of West End don't want to lose the bohemian rattiness of their neighbourhood; and the blockies at Tara just want to be left alone.
That's fine but what about other people's self-interest, yours and mine - society's?
We're going to have to put southeast Queensland's growing population somewhere and if the ULDA can deliver new communities even close to their vision then I'm all for it, as long as they deal respectfully with concerned Greenbank residents.
I also don't have a problem with West End high-rises, as long as we spend the time to make sure they complement rather than destroy what's already there.
And as long as the gas companies are paying Tara locals a fair price, then let's get this new coal-seam gas industry started up as soon as possible, for the economic good of all of us.
This isn't to champion progress at any price, or to say we should automatically back Goliath against David, but rather to suggest that whenever locals feel threatened by development on their doorstep they will get more sympathy if they can explain how it threatens all of us and not just their own way of life.
And that's not to let the likes of the ULDA or QGC, the company negotiating with Tara landowners, off the hook. Public acceptance of progress only works if those in charge of all that progress actually deliver on their promises.
We in Queensland live in a dynamic place.
We can all find a reason to grumble about things not being the way they used to be.
We'd be better served taking that energy and using it to make sure the future is the way we want it to be, by holding the ULDA et al to account, every step of the way.

ILM,Illawarra Mercury,2011,1,"NEW battles over coal seam gas have been sparked on all sides of the Illawarra, with residents complaining they have not been kept informed about exploration projects near their land.
Coal seam gas is seen by some as a  cleaner  energy source for the future but many people in the Illawarra are not aware of the active exploration project in the area.
 Shoalhaven councillors expressed alarm last week when they discovered Planet Gas and Leichhardt Resources had an exploration which covered the area from Shellharbour to Nowra and west to Berrima.
Councillor Amanda Findley - who is running for the Greens in the NSW seat of South Coast - said the first many councillors knew of the project was when she told them last week.
 It's inexcusable the community doesn't know - but that's the modus operandi of many government departments,  she said.
The Mercury reported on Leichhardt and Planet's exploration licence last month.
Meanwhile, Planet Gas wants to conduct exploratory drilling on properties outside Mittagong, with the Wingecarribee Shire Council opposed to it.
Planet Gas has not responded to questions from the Mercury.
Several Illawarra residents travelled to Sydney yesterday for a protest rally against coal seam gas at Martin Place, and the Country Women's Association hosted a community meeting on coal seam gas at Stanwell Park on Saturday.
Much of the concern over coal seam gas surrounds the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or  fracking , where water, sand and chemicals are blasted into the seam to break up the coal and release the gas. The  BTEX  chemicals can include the carcinogen benzene.
The practice has been blamed for contaminating water supplies in Queensland and the United States, and the threat to water supplies is at the heart of most residents' concerns.
The issue has touched the NSW election campaign. Labor last week announced it would ban the use of BTEX chemicals if re-elected, set up exclusion zones in unspecified areas, and ban exploration activities near waterways which adjoin national parks.
The Greens have called for a special commission of inquiry into the coal seam gas industry and its approvals by the Government.
A new group called Stop CSG Illawarra was formed a week ago to campaign on the issue.
Battle for the escarpment
THE iconic escarpment is home to the Illawarra Coal Measures, one of the state's richest fields of metallurgical coal - seams which are also notoriously  gassy .
Coal seam gas extraction involves draining methane from the seam and using it for energy.
Sometimes the methane sits in the  goaf  - the collapsed mine wall where coal has been removed.
But often it is still locked in a seam of coal, and extraction methods focus on fracturing the coal seam to release the gas.
Proponents say it is a cleaner way to make electricity than burning coal, and with the methane sitting in the coal seam or in the goaf, pumping it out can ensure it is not released into the atmosphere.
But a growing number of people are concerned about the environmental effects, particularly contamination of groundwater and the drinking water catchment, and the industry's fast growth has taken them by surprise.

ILM,Illawarra Mercury,2011,1,"RESIDENTS in the Illawarra's bushy northern reaches are mounting a belated campaign against a coal seam gas exploration project near their land.
In September 2009 Apex Energy won permission from the Government to drill 15 exploration wells in the area from Darkes Forest down to the escarpment behind Coledale and Austinmer.
 Recently, Apex has applied for permission to drill an additional test well, inside a Sydney Catchment Authority (SCA) restricted  special area , next to a swamp near the Woronora Dam.
The Darkes Forest project has a capital investment of $7.4 million, and would create eight jobs over an operational period of three years.
Resident Karen Dinsdale, 46, who bought a property at Darkes Forest last year, said she had no idea about the project until January.
 I've got a dam which feeds horses; opposite is the Sydney Water catchment,  she said.
 You don't want chemicals on your back doorstep just so they can make money.
 Had I known about this before I bought the property, I wouldn't have bought it. 
The plan was reported in the Mercury in 2009 and 2010. But then, as now, residents complained they were given little information about the project.
Apex has said it does not intend to use the controversial hydraulic fracturing method - known as  fracking  - at Darkes Forest.
The company's chief operating officer Chris Rogers complains the project has been beset by misinformation, and people have had plenty of warning.
He said Apex has not done any drilling in the area since 2004, and does not intend to use  fracking  to extract gas.
 The joint venture [with Ormil Energy] has worked closely with landowners and neighbouring residents,  he said.
 We have also presented technical papers in the Illawarra and elsewhere on project progress and methodology.
 Apex has also presented a project update to the community of Darkes Forest at the village hall. This meeting was viewed by us as extremely constructive.
 Apex and Ormil have already demonstrated a commitment to the environment by virtue of the meticulous planning process and consultation thus far. No issues have been encountered in any of its exploration activities to date which are either technical, social or environmental. 
Greg Petty, who is running on the issue as an independent candidate for the state seat of Heathcote, said even if fracking is not used, chemicals will still threaten the water catchment.
 To me it's unproven technology and there is information [here] and internationally that coal seam gas is a noxious process,  he said.
SCA's Woronora  special area  is a no entry catchment zone, where people are not allowed to walk, ride bikes or take animals. Penalties of up to $11,000 apply.
SCA says the areas are to  protect our water supply by acting as a buffer zone to help stop nutrients and other substances that could affect the quality of water entering the storages .
The decision on the 16th well is before the NSW Planning Department.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"With the nuclear crisis in Japan triggering a new wave of demand for fresh energy supplies, attention has quickly turned to the development of planned liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia.
Near the top of the pile are three Queensland-based projects promoted byÂ energy giants BG Group, Santos/Petroliam Nasional Berhad and Origin Energy/ConocoPhillips. The projects share two things in common: all will use Gladstone as their base and all have hired US contractor Bechtel to design their LNG facilities. Given the looming skills shortage, Conoco, in particular, would assume it will get access to Bechtel's top workers to develop its Australia Pacific LNG facility. The two companies signed a pact in 1996 for Conoco's Optimised Cascade LNG process technology where Bechtel is the exclusive provider of engineering work and preferred construction contractor for Cascade projects including the three Gladstone developments.
 But whispers from Gladstone say Conoco has been allocated a subpar contracting team from Bechtel (dubbed the  C team  in the industry) for APLNG. Conoco is understood to be so annoyed it may rip up its licensing deal with Bechtel and open the Cascade technology process to other contractors. The two companies are likely to work out a compromise, but the spat illustrates tensions in the race to produce the first LNG from the state.

 Everything this industry does is regulated,  he said.
He says only a few companies are working with landholders in the region and production is some way off.
Mr Dunn says problems with two gas wells in southern Queensland have been rectified.
 Any coal seam gas production is hundreds of metres under the ground and it certainly won't have any effect on the root zone or for plant growth,  he said.
 We've got something like 1,600 producing gas wells in Queensland, and without excusing those two, leaking gas wells are the exception rather than the rule. 
Health fears
Meanwhile, a doctors' group says there needs to be a serious investigation into the health effects of coal seam gas mining before the industry is allowed to expand further.
Environmentalists and farmers have expressed concern about air and water pollution caused by gas wells.
Dr Helen Redmond from Doctors for the Environment says the Surat Basin will be home to tens of thousands of wells in the next 20 years and the medical ramifications have to be examined before that happens.
 It's what we don't know at the moment that is of greatest concern,  she said.
 The full situation hasn't been analysed and I think that's why Doctors for the Environment is supporting a call for a full and independent inquiry into this industry.

APNDAH,Dalby Herald,2011,1,"As a relatively new resident to Dalby, the entire LNG and Coal Seam Gas issue is one that I knew little about until I moved to the region.
I was aware of the project, as any Queenslander would be, but like most people not living in the area, the issue didn't affect me, so I hadn't really taken much notice of its implications.
 Of course, now that I live here, and while it doesn't affect me directly as a landholder, I believe that I have a much more divested interest in understanding the issue as a whole, the effects it will have on the environment and what this whole industry means not just to me but my children and their children.
I had a unique opportunity last week to join a number of journalists and QGC management to tour Kenya and Windibri, the companies jewels in their gas field crown.
I was impressed by the sheer magnitude and complexity of both operations, and the sheer number of people employed at both sites.
I was also struck by the obsession for safety, not only for the journalists, but for the staff.
Their working conditions were excellent, and their willingness to allow journalists and photographers to freely access both facilities.
I was also impressed by the number of women who work in these facilities in very high ranking positions.
I wasn't impressed by the way that the very small number of protestors conducted themselves and their attempts to hold our bus hostage in an attempt to create media hype.
But all journalists need to be commended for ignoring the rantings of the single local protestor who was being egged on by activist Drew Hutton and another protestor from the Hunter Valley who don't even live in the area.
The language used by local landholder Dane Pratzky and his personal attack on a QGC manager was uncalled for and detrimental to their cause.
However, I must say that as a Queenslander, I was concerned about a map the media was shown outlining the amount of the state that will be affected by Coal Seam Gas wells.
I estimate that at least a third of the state, 30 centimetres under our topsoil is owned by foreign and local mining companies for gas extraction at this early stage, and I am sure that as the industry expands, more of the Sunshine State will become coal gas seam centre of the country.
My concern is that the state government has its eyes and treasury coffers set firmly on the profits to be gained from this new, but unpopular industry, and has lost sight of its role to act in the best interest of all Queenslanders, our future, our health and our rights.
Let's just hope that the outcome of next election, if it goes against Labor, won't be too late to be able to reverse any damage this government has already done.

APNNOS,The Northern Star,2011,1,"I ATTENDED the Metgasco information night at the Casino RSM Club on March 14. There was acapacity crowd.
I managed to find a seat on the side of the auditorium among a couple of tables of Metgasco employees. I know they were Metgasco emp-loyees because I asked them.
 These people loudly cheered and always started the applause for all of the Metgasco speakers. They also repeatedly jeered and laughed at the questions by local residents.
Why were these employees even there taking up valuable seats?
Surely they don't need to attend to learn about Metgasco activities?
I can only conclude by their behaviour that they were there to help sway public opinion. If so, I think they have no right to come into our community and try to divide andinflame local residents like that.
Thanks to Rotary, which sponsored the event, though I find it strange that anyone other than Metgasco needs to pay out money and time for these information presentations.
I found a lot of the information they gave us confusing. For example, Aiden Stuart, gas operations manager, first told us that the process of fraccing was a safe and industry-accepted method, and concluded by saying Metgasco doesn't even use fraccing in this region, so don't worry about it.
Hamish Ramsey, the land administration officer for Metgasco, has advised me otherwise in recent correspondence. He told me that they are fraccing the Kingfisher well, which is located close to town, next to Casino airport. I understand that fraccing is done repeatedly during the lifetime of the well, not just once. Who's right?
This makes me think that more of what they told me on Monday night may not be correct either. However, I'm glad I was able to attend. I met with many people there who want the Government to ask more questions about the safety of this industry before they go any further.
I would not have known about the rally to stop coal seam gas mining and toxic poisoning of our aquifers and freshwater systems outside the Nationals' office in Lismore onSaturday.

High school needed
FROM Pottsville to Kingscliff is a 30-minute ride on the school bus, and from Pottsville to Murwillumbah is more than an hour on the school bus.
Why do our kids have to travel for hours a day on a school bus to attend high schools that are overflowing?
We need a high school in Pottsville and we need one now. There is room for one in the Seabreeze Estate, or even in the precinct of Pottsville Beach Primary School.
We call on our local member Geoff Provest and the Minister for Education and Training, Verity Firth, toseriously look at this situation and speak to parents in Pottsville about their intentions.
Everyone knows that Kingscliff High is getting too crowded and the Banora Point and Tweed River schools are well above the stateaverage in student numbers.
What are we going to do when the Casuarina precinct and Kings Forest developments are finished, let alone the estates of Black Rocks, Seabreeze and Koala Beach? These are not pie in the sky plans. These residential areas are filling up fast and it is young families that are moving in.
If it takes five years to build a high school then we need to start now.

More police needed
FOR the first time since I have lived in Ballina, I get a bit nervous if I go outside after dark. It's worse on weekends and holidays.
Every time I pick up the paper there are reports of criminals vandalising and robbing schools, shops, homes and charitable institutions. Where are the police?
There are not enough police in the Ballina Shire. The criminals know it and target areas with little or no police protection. Why isn't there a police station in every town in the Ballina Shire? More police, less crime. Simple. Why doesn't the government listen?

Catch and release
ONE of the biggest forces in modern culture is in the concept of â€œcatch and releaseâ€? in recreational fishing.
I once worked catching fish for an aquarium in Queensland and if, during the capture of a fish, I wiped some of the slime off its body within a couple of days there would be pussy ulcerated sores on the fish wher-ever the slime got wiped off.
So, unless you release the fish without wiping any of its slime off, which can come off simply by touching it, you are condemning that fish to a slow painful death.
Another example of our ignorance when dealing with the natural world.

AAPFIN,Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire,2011,1,"LEIGHTON SYDNEY, March 23 AAP - John Holland says it has been awarded a $150 million subcontract to build marine offloading facilities for the proposed Curtis Island liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility off Queensland.
The construction work would form part of the Gladstone LNG (GLNG) project, the engineering firm said in a statement on Wednesday.
 Under the subcontract, John Holland will design and construct a new ferry berth, a roll on/roll off berth, load on/load off berth and a bulk aggregate unloading berth to be delivered for contractor Bechtel Australia Pty Ltd.
Included in the contract scope are the engineering, design, procurement, supply, fabrication, transportation, erection and installation works necessary to complete the new marine facilities.
 The marine offloading facilities are an integral part of the GLNG project,  said Brendan Petersen, John Holland's executive general manager of energy and resources businesses.
 The timely completion of this facility is critical to the overall success of the GLNG project. 
Construction of the new marine facilities would start immediately, with completion expected in 2012, the company said.
John Holland is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leighton Holdings Ltd.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Australian resources stocks experienced a turbulent week in the wake of Japan's earthquake, but for many commodities the medium to long-term outlook remains bright.
Booming commodities prices, triggered by unprecedented demand for coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas (LNG), have created renewed investor interest in the resources sector in the past 12 months.
 But just as some experts were questioning whether Australia's mining and energy boom was in danger of turning into a bubble, the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan grounded many resources stocks that had flown high on seemingly insatiable demand from emerging countries, including China and India.
Japan remains Australia's second-largest export destination, behind China. With commodities providing almost 90 per cent of those exports, there was immediate panic about the ramifications for mining and energy companies.
While the sell-off in uranium stocks following Japan's nuclear crisis was expected, newly fearful investors also exited companies across other exposed commodities.
JPMorgan says stocks that have been harshly punished include Fortescue Metals Group, OZ Minerals, Equinox Minerals, OneSteel, Atlas Iron, Mineral Resources and Kingsgate Consolidated. Australian steel makers such as OneSteel and BlueScope stand to benefit from disruption to Japanese steel production. UBS also favours Fortescue in the post-correction phase along with Rio Tinto, PanAust and Woodside Petroleum.
Fund managers and equity strategists accept commodity demand will take a short-term hit, but remain bullish on a rapid rebound once Japan reconstructs.
Pengana Capital fund manager Tim Schroeders, who manages about $1 billion in funds across mining and energy stocks, says interest in safe-haven stocks is likely to buoy the gold and copper sectors in the short term.
 It is very difficult to see uranium stocks bouncing back straight away, but we see good value emerging in the gold sector against a backdrop of uncertainty,  he says.
Pengana sees good opportunities in Newcrest Mining, the fourth-largest gold company in the world, and one of Australia's newest gold producers, Integra Mining.
 With the price of gold coming back a bit, the expectations are not there in terms of huge price rises and I think there is some good value to be had in both of these stocks. 
He also pointed to the recent re-rating of the oil and gas sector, given the expected increase in LNG imports to compensate for Japan's lost nuclear power generating capacity. UBS estimates Japan may need an additional 5 million tonnes of LNG this year, and argues any increase in Japanese LNG imports should boost Asian LNG spot prices â€“ with Woodside's North-West Shelf LNG project the energy stock it tips to win new contracts.
Bernstein Research says the loss from the damaged nuclear facilities and halt to new facilities across Asia could boost LNG demand by up to 13 per cent by 2020.
Companies poised to benefit include Woodside, Oil Search and Santos. Junior energy players with exposure to the coal seam gas to LNG sector in Queensland are also tipped to benefit from the sell-off in uranium stocks.
Companies including Liquefied Natural Gas, Dart Energy and Bow Energy either hold production facilities or gas fields that may be snapped up by energy majors including Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group and ConocoPhillips, which are operating large facilities from the port of Gladstone.
The rise in the oil price beyond $US100 a barrel has put crude at its highest level in two years, with investors able to gain leverage to the price from companies with growing production profiles.
 We've already seen money raised out of the uranium sellout finding its way into energy stocks with LNG exposure,  Schroeders says.
 That thematic is pretty strong and the alternative energy sector may also have some legs over the medium term.
 Commodities like copper may also be in high demand during the reconstruction phase in Japan. Analysts say a seasonal drop in the copper price in April-May may also provide some buying opportunities as more marginal producers enter the market. Copper is our pick of the base metals with the price around $US4 a pound and stocks holding up very well. 
Uranium stocks were predictably hammered in the wake of the Japan crisis last week.
Yet some analysts argue companies, including Paladin Energy and Rio Tinto subsidiary Energy Resources of Australia remain good value with both trading below price targets.
Although China has temporarily frozen development of a raft of new nuclear facilities, brokers such as Southern Cross Equities insist now is a good time to buy.
 Paladin is well placed to service the growth in nuclear energy that is certain to be ongoing in other parts of the world, where its target markets lie,  says Southern Cross Equities analyst Peter Chapman.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"Energy company AGL faced the community in Gloucester in the NSW Upper Hunter last night to respond to concerns over its planned coal seam gas project in the region.
The State Government last month approved AGL's plans for up to 110 gas wells and a pipeline corridor between Stroud and Hexham.
 About 200 people attended the three-hour meeting organised by the Barrington-Gloucester-Stroud Preservation Alliance.
But the Alliance's Graeme Healy says the company didn't want the media reporting on the event.
 When it was announced by the moderator to the crowd last night that media wouldn't be allowed, it caused an uproar, understandably and predictably, and it just creates in people's minds a sense of suspicion,  he said.
 What have they got to hide, why aren't they being open, why won't they put it on the public record?

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"Gas giant AGL has faced questions from residents concerned about the approval of more than 100 wells on the mid north coast.
The company has been given the green light to construct up to 110 coal seam gas wells in the Gloucester basin.
 Graeme Healy from the Barrington-Gloucester-Stroud Preservation Society organised last night's meeting, and says about 200 people attended.
He says residents' main concerns are the potential environmental impacts.
 I was very keen to have the meeting go as long as it needed, to have all the questions answered,  he said.
 There's obviously a great concern about water.
 There's a great concern about water in the sense of produced water, what's going to happen to it, what's it going to do to the soil and how is it going to impact agriculture here. 
Meanwhile, local councillors are concerned the major water and sewerage service to the area hasn't been part of the consultation or design process.
But Mid Coast Water's general manager, Neil Hannington, says he is not sure why the State government did not ask for input.
 When we contacted the Department of Planning, it virtually came back that it was an oversight, that they did not look at Mid Coast Water,  he said.
 I suppose the water industry was represented by the department of water or the office of water.
 But our concerns are that it would have been good to be part of the negotiations, just to get some handle on what they're doing, and how they're going to do it.

AGEE,The Age,2011,1,"BG GROUP has stopped construction of the coal seam gas pipeline that will connect gasfields with its $US15 billion LNG export facility after possibly breaching environmental guidelines.
BG's Australian arm, QGC, said it stopped construction last Thursday after finding out a day earlier that its contractor, MCJV, might have failed to adhere to the environmental conditions imposed by the federal and Queensland governments.
 QGC senior vice-president Jim Knudsen said the company became aware of the situation through an internal review after MCJV began clearing a six-kilometre by 40-metre area for the pipeline near Dalby.
 We do not believe the clearing has had an adverse impact on protected plants and animals and the potential breaches do not affect the safety of people,  he said.  We stopped work because we are committed to doing the right thing and we take seriously our obligations to meet more than 1500 state and federal conditions on the Queensland Curtis (QC) LNG project. 
Mr Knudsen said QGC had informed the federal and Queensland governments on Tuesday about the possible breach. Work will remain suspended until a compliance review is completed.
While it is not expected to delay the planned 2014 completion date for QC LNG, it is unhelpful for the company, which only last week faced a blockade by people protesting against the coal seam gas development.
Several people were arrested after standing in front of bulldozers trying to enter the site. Locals are concerned about groundwater contamination through the drilling of coal seam gas wells.
QGC said the  suspended pipeline work is unrelated to the connection of five wells to an underground pipeline system .

APNCHN,Chinchilla News,2011,1,"The Basin Sustainability Alliance has launched an online calculator for landholders to estimate the cost of coal seam gas development.
BSA chairman Ian Hayllor said the Well Calculator could allow landholders to see what impact the installation of wells would have on their property.
 â€œMany landholders have CSG tenures over their land but are unsure as to what it really means to them,  Mr Hayllor said.
â€œWe hope that this CSG Well Calculator will encourage landholders to be proactive in developing their property plans to protect their surface rights.
â€œWe also think that this could be a useful tool for businesses who rely on primary production â€“ such as agronomists, machinery manufacturers and other rural supply businesses â€“ to consider the impact gasfield development may have on their farming clients and the ripple effect this may have on their businesses.â€?
The calculator uses average and minimum well density spacings to calculate the number of CSG wells which the company could consider for an area of land and it also provides an estimate of the area that would be used for gravelled roadways.
Mr Hayllor stressed that it was important landholders realised that CSG companies are not required to notify individual affected landholders of their plans.
â€œThe onus is on the landholder to watch the public notices section of newspapers, seek out the application and raise their concerns through a submission processâ€?, he said.
â€œThe CSG companies are only required consult with landholders when they need access to the property, so we are encouraging landholders to be prepared and informed before they get the knock on the door from the CSG company. The consultation period is the landholder's key opportunity to make sure that impacts are minimised and unreasonable interference to the landholder's business and lifestyle is avoided.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"THE Greens will exploit their role as possible kingmakers in the coming Queensland election by demanding a moratorium on the state's mining industry.
Greens spokeswoman Larissa Waters stressed the major issue facing Queensland was the rapid development of the mining industry, both in coal and coal seam gas.
 ``Both parties seem to be equally committed to a big expansion of the coal industry and the creation of a new coal seam gas industry,'' said Ms Walters, who will enter the Senate on July 1. ``We would like to see a moratorium on the coal seam gas industry until we can get a clearer idea of its full effect on the environment and people's lives.''
In the 2009 Queensland election, the Greens claimed their preferences helped elect 10 ALP members as part of their 51 seats in the 89-seat parliament.
But while the party received 8 per cent of the vote statewide, the most recent Newspoll shows its support at 13 per cent.
While the Greens insisted yesterday they did not want to allocate preferences and preferred to leave matters to individual voters, they have allocated preferences to Labor in almost all elections.
Their preferences will be vital to Labor's chances of holding inner-city seats such as Mt Coot-tha and the bellwether seat of Ashgrove, where the LNP's leader-in-waiting Campbell Newman will take on Labor's Environment Minister Kate Jones.
The Greens endorsed local doctor Sandra Bayley on Tuesday night as their candidate for Ashgrove, where they gained 13 per cent of the vote in the last election, but their preferences helped deliver the seat for Ms Jones.
Dr Bayley said while she would be campaigning on local issues, she was also very concerned about the statewide impact of the coal industry on the physical health of people today and the economic health of the state in the future.
``I know this is the edge of Brisbane, but many people in Ashgrove are very concerned about our reliance on extractive industries and the whole rate of change that's happening in Queensland,'' she said.
The NSW branch of the Greens declared yesterday it wanted to see the coal industry in that state shut down. But mining is becoming more important to the Queensland economy and the state is on the cusp of massive expansion of its coal industry.
It is also creating the new industry of mining coal seam gas and then converting it into liquefied natural gas for export.
Any moves to curtail the mining industry would have a big effect on voters in mining areas in central and north Queensland, but are likely to be better received in urban areas of southeast Queensland.
In recent weeks there have been protests against the industry on the gas fields of the Darling Downs in southern Queensland.
Yesterday, the main company involved in the new industry, Queensland Gas Co, was forced to shut down construction of a major pipeline after it admitted it had not followed environmental protocols.
Ms Jones said the incident showed the regulatory framework was working. ``Today's announcement demonstrates that projects will be stopped if they don't meet the key conditions of their environmental approval,'' she said.
But Greens spokeswoman Libby Connors called the government response weak.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"COAL-SEAM gas operator Queensland Gas has stopped construction of the pipeline between its gasfields in southern Queensland and the planned processing plant in Gladstone after accidentally breaking environment rules.
The company became aware of the potential breaches last week after an internal review found they had not followed the correct protocols for clearing a piece of land near Dalby on the Darling Downs, where it intends to lay a pipe.
 Queensland Gas senior vice-president Jim Knudsen said the corridor in question was 6km long and 40m wide, and the protocols involved related to soil and species management.
``We do not believe the clearing has had an adverse impact on protected plants and animals and the potential breaches do not affect the safety of people,'' Mr Knudsen said. ``We have stopped work because we are committed to doing the right thing.''
He said work on the project would not resume until all environmental protocols had been received, but said that it would not affect the overall timeline for the project, with liquid natural gas scheduled to come out of Gladstone in 2014.
But the incident is another public relations setback for an industry that has been under strong public pressure recently. Environmentalists blockaded Queensland Gas's fields near Chinchilla last week, and a 71-year-old woman was arrested while protesting against Queensland Gas.
The area cleared in this instance is not the place where protests occurred last week.
Queensland Environment Minister Kate Jones said the voluntary stoppage by Queensland Gas showed that the government regulatory framework worked.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"THE UK's BG Group yesterday embarrassingly halted initial work on its Darling Downs-to-Gladstone gas pipeline because the project had kicked off without some necessary environmental approvals.
The pipeline is a major part of BG subsidiary QGC's planned $US15 billion coal seam gas-to-liquefied natural gas export project, set to pump about 8.5 million tonnes of LNG into world markets from Gladstone's Curtis Island from 2014-15. Protesters have been picketing QGC's operations, near Chinchilla, objecting to the group's initial plans for a small gas gathering system in the area - an area admittedly eventually scheduled to sport many more CSG wells.
 But though QGC has signed agreements with landowners affected by its Chinchilla-Tara gas gathering network, a number of locals - and the likes of Friends of the Earth environmental campaigner Drew Hutton - have instigated a high-profile opposition to any more CSG gas development.
QGC senior vice-president Jim Knudsen said yesterday QGC had nevertheless decided to announce that it had halted the big pipeline project as soon as it became aware that some environmental protection plans had not been formally ticked off by the relevant authorities.
``We want people to understand we are determined to comply with all the (1500) conditions imposed on the project,'' he told The Courier-Mail.
``We made the announcement, not wanting someone else to point out some boxes had not been formally ticked.''
Mr Knudsen said QGC became aware last Wednesday that plans for soil and species management may not have been approved before clearing on the first path of the pipeline right-of-way began. ``We don't believe the clearing has had an adverse impact on protected plants and animals and the potential breaches do not affect people's safety,'' he said.
Queensland Minister for Environment and Resource Management Kate Jones said QGC's announcement showed the government's environmental regulatory framework was working.
``It's unacceptable that this clearing (of about 6km of the proposed 340km pipeline's right of way) has occurred without the conditions first being met,'' Ms Jones said.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said: ``QGC has been used to cutting corners and now they're trying to prove to everybody that they are improving their behaviour.''

FQLCOL,Queensland Country Life,2011,1,"THE landmark Roma district cattle holding and former home of anti-coal seam gas campaigner, Dr Jim Baker, AM, may be sold to a gas company.
The executor of Dr Baker's will, David Grace, will not confirm or deny reports one or more gas development companies had expressed interest in bidding for Lighthouse when it goes up for auction on April 8.
  A number of people and organisations have expressed an interest in the sale and those gas companies are active in the area,  he said.
 Mrs (Jill) Baker and I as executor are pleased with the interest that is being shown. One can only say that a proper auction with strong interest from buyers should produce a good result on the day. 
Mr Grace saw no evidence of recent claims that the development of coal seam gas infrastructure near Roma was having a negative impact on local property values.
 There's certainly no lack of interest in Lighthouse,  he said.
Dr Baker campaigned strongly in the media and at public meetings to protect landholders' interests.
 He did have concerns about farmers having a say,  Mr Grace said.
 He also worked with one of the gas companies to overcome those concerns and to achieve more by working together. The Queensland Government responded to Dr Baker's work in the Geothermal Energy Act, which came into force at the end of 2010. 
Roma Property agent, Vince O'Brien, said many people would be watching the sale of Lighthouse to gauge the impact of gas industry development on land values.
 Lighthouse is surrounded by coal seam development,  he said.
 Two nearby properties, Spring Gully and Pony Hills were bought by gas company interests years ago and now contain a large part of the local gas industry infrastructure, including several camps and offices.
 About 33 wells are scheduled to be drilled in the Lighthouse area, but locals don't really trust the gas companies' figures. In the end, there could be 333. 
Mr O'Brien said a lot of uncertainty was being caused by disparities in the gas company compensation paid to landholders.  Some are paid $10,000 a well, but others with less of a standing in the community are getting just $1500,  he said.  Boomerang and Havago were two blocks that sold in this area recently. But they were not so directly affected by gas project development as the region around Lighthouse. I'd put those sales as being 22-23 percent below the market peak and I'd say the difference was caused by the gas factor.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Gas giant BG Group's admission of delays with parts of its $US15 billion-plus liquefied natural gas project has raised questions over the company's relationship with its contractors.
BG has started an investigation into how its main pipeline contractor MCJV, a joint venture between McConnell Dowell Constructors and Consolidated Contractors, started work on the gas line linking the Surat Basin and Gladstone without some environmental approvals in place.
 The MCJV group working on the mammoth gas project is thought to be less than impressed with the failure in BG's own internal environmental checks and balances that led to it starting work early.
The contracting joint venture may want to watch its step. BG is understood to have recently hired investigators to probe another company working on the project after details of its contract with BG were leaked. A thorough search failed to find any evidence of who was responsible but all third parties working with BG have been put on notice to play by the rules if they want to be part of Queensland's lucrative gas windfall.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Just months into the construction of its $US15 billion-plus Â­liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, Britain's BG Group has had to stop work on its Â­principal gas pipeline due to possible breaches of environmental conditions.
While BG said yesterday the stoppage would not affect the project's 2014 start-up date, the admission is an embarrassment for the company and provides fodder for farmers and environmentalists vehemently opposed to Queensland's emerging $70 billion LNG industry.
 Those groups have already voiced doubts that the huge coal seam gas-based plants planned on Gladstone's Curtis Island can be developed without damaging the environment and polluting the waterways.
The latest incident occurred as BG's QGC unit comes under fire from residents in the Tara region in the Surat Basin, who are aiming to disrupt work to connect gas wells to an underground gas gathering system.
Information released yesterday by QGC indicated that the main pipeline contractor, MCJV, a venture between McÂ­Connell Dowell and Consolidated Contractors, had begun work on the line before all the environmental plans had been approved.
The 540-kilometre line will transport coal seam gas from fields in the Surat Basin to the LNG plant on Curtis Island.
QGC said it became aware last Wednesday that work had started on a right-of-way for construction of a section of pipeline near Dalby without approvals being in place for some environmental plans for soil and species management. It ordered MCJV to stop work the following day, pending a compliance review.
 QGC yesterday advised Queensland and [the] commonwealth government regulator of the potential breaches and that we had stopped work until we meet all of our obligations,  said QGC senior vice-president Jim Knudsen.
Work on the line would not resume until QGC was meeting all its obligations under the more than 1500 state and federal conditions surrounding the Curtis LNG project, he said.
QGC said there should be no  material  impact on the project schedule.
BG was investigating how the work had started without the approvals, a QGC spokesman said.
The federal Environment Department said it was examining the matter to ensure BG fully complied with its obligations.
But Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said QGC's statement was merely an attempt by the company to persuade the public it had improved its environmental performance.
The environmental breaches were  trivial  in comparison with QGC's failure to act on leaking gas wells and pipelines and to provide detailed information on the impact of its activities on underground water systems and other cumulative environmental effects, he said.
 QGC, like the other companies, is conducting an uncontrolled experiment on the Queensland environment .â€Š.â€Š. the Queensland and federal governments have allowed them to do it. 
KEY POINTS
QCG says it became aware last week work had begun without environmental approvals.
Friends of the Earth says the breach is  trivial  compared with other environmental issues.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"A time capsule documenting the landscape in Gloucester in the NSW Upper Hunter before coal seam gas mining has been stolen.
The local community had submitted newspaper articles, photos, film and submission letters, opposing AGL gas wells that have now been approved, to the capsule as a record for future generations.
 President of environment lobby group Rivers SOS, Amanda Albury, says it's alarming that the capsule was taken from her property.
 The idea of the time capsule is to keep a record of the valley as it was before AGL Gas moved in, with photographs and film of the area before they started drilling, before they started buying up the land.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The Federal Lyne Independent is calling for Commonwealth intervention over the recent State Government decision to approve coal seam gas wells in the Gloucester Basin.
During parliamentary question time yesterday, Robert Oakeshott asked the Environment Minister, Tony Burke, to undertake a full review of the approval, including comprehensive risk assessments and consultation.
 Mr Oakeshott says the State government is in breach of at least the spirit of caretaker conventions, after approving the drilling of 110 coal seam gas wells in the Gloucester Basin.
He says the basin covers 50 square kilometres, including the pristine Barrington region and key farming land throughout the Gloucester and Upper Hunter area.
Mr Oakeshott says the approval was done without consulting MidCoast water or downstream water users in the Manning Valley.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"KOGAN By Lisa Martin
BRISBANE, March 25 AAP - Landowners and an Aboriginal tribesman say they fear a Queensland coal seam gas company has destroyed parts of a sacred stone site west of Brisbane.
 Cattle farmers Rob and Sharon Lohse say parts of the ancient Aboriginal stone arrangements have vanished with Queensland Gas Company's development of the Sean 12 gas well at Kogan, near Dalby.
The well is on a property known as Kerrsdale, adjacent to the Lohses's property Kia-Ora.
Mr Lohse told AAP the couple considered themselves to be guardians of the sacred site since they bought their property 15 years ago.
He said 25 per cent of the sacred site overlapped Kerrsdale, a claim that Queensland Gas Company denies.
Two of the stone configurations appear to have been destroyed by the gas development, he said.
 They haven't followed the correct procedure,  Mr Lohse said.
 They went in and cleared a few acres, put a road in ... there were two stone arrangements there, and we haven't been able to find them.
 I was out there with (Aboriginal tribesman) Neil Stanley. We walked the area and we couldn't find them. 
Mr Stanley, a Barunggam tribe member, told AAP the site was a place for initiation and secret men's business.
 They've cut a 3000-year-old tradition ... where the boy becomes a man,  he said.
 I'm just shaking my head ... my eyes just water. 
He said Barunggam people dealing with Queensland Gas Company were not properly protecting the heritage site.
Archaeology consultant Michael Strong, who inspected the site in 2000, told AAP it could possibly be thousands of years old.
The sacred site had been fenced off from cattle for nearly 100 years and was very well cared for by the Lohses, Mr Strong said.
 When you walk into the paddock you're seeing the vegetation Aboriginal people would have seen traditionally, that has been lost or virtually wiped out ... since European settlement.
 You've got ecology that's quite crucial. 
Mr Strong said it would be  appalling  if the site had been damaged.
 Cultural sites are protected in Queensland, there's a ... $750,000 fine for destroying them knowingly,  he said.
Mr Strong said he knew of cases where companies were happy to pay the fine and continue with their mining efforts.
 It's a very cynical approach,  he said, adding he was not attributing blame in this case.
The Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM), Queensland Gas Company, concerned landowners and Mr Stanley met in early March to discuss the stone arrangements.
Neighbour Bill Anderson said state government departments were rubber-stamping gas companies' paperwork.
 The gas companies have a green light to do whatever they want, and the government is acting as the department to smooth the way for them,  he said.
Queensland Gas Company spokesman Ben Myers denied there was a sacred site on the Kerrsdale property.
 We've had the local traditional owners give full clearance and a archaeologist visit the site,  he said.
 We've done everything by the book. 
Mr Myers said the company was following all proper procedures and had not broken the laws.
He said Mr Stanley did not represent the Barunggam people in a legal sense.
 He's decided to take the position he has. It's really a matter for the Barunggam people,  he said.
 The process is written in law, it's the process everyone else has used.
 We've followed it to the letter. 
Comment has been sought from DERM.

ABCTRS,Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcripts,2011,1,"Japanese Opposition MP, Taro Kono, has long argued against Japan's reliance on nuclear power, and he says Japan must move to an energy strategy that includes renewables and natural gas. Taro Kono is also on the Liberal Democratic Party's counter-relief committee. The group is examining better ways of responding and preparing for such disasters as this month's earthquake and tsunami.
Monica Attard: Hi there. You're listening to Sunday Profile. I'm Monica Attard.
 And my guest today is Taro Kono, a member of the Japanese parliament, who's on a crusade to steer his country away from nuclear energy, and towards renewable sources to keep his country's enormous energy needs fulfilled.
In 2009, Taro Kono campaigned to become president of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, a position once occupied by his father, Yohei Kono, a former foreign minister, but the only LDP leader never to have become prime minister of Japan.
Not that either defeat has impacted the rise and rise of the younger politician. His popularity in his home prefecture of Kanagawa grows with every election he's faced since 1996, when he first entered parliament.
And his message has been consistent, too. Nuclear energy is not the future in his country, if only because the relationships between the power companies - which run the industry - and the Japanese government and bureaucracy is essentially corrupt.
Kono, also a member of his party's counter-disaster relief committee, thinks Japan is at a crossroads now with the Fukushima disaster giving the country a so-far denied chance to really debate whether to go for a mix of renewables, oil and natural gas, or to stick with a nuclear energy strategy, which he says is clearly flawed.
Taro Kono says the disaster at Fukushima - despite being triggered by the tsunami which has killed more than 9,000 people, with 16,000 people still missing - is changing minds about which way to go.
But first, to the efforts to stabilise the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant.
Taro Kono: Well, I think they are now trying to get the power back at the nuclear power plant and reactor so that they can control the temperature of the water in those four reactors.
Monica Attard: Are they having any success at this point in time, from the official advice that you're receiving?
Taro Kono: One of the reactor was steaming, or maybe smoking, yesterday. So they had to evacuate those personnel back to the safe place.
They're going to try to go back and get the power back.
I think one of the control rooms now has a light on. And we're still trying to tackle three other reactor control rooms.
Monica Attard: And there are, of course, reports now that radioactive iodine has been detected in the water system. How serious is that as a threat, at this point in time?
Taro Kono: Well, the governor of Tokyo yesterday announced that their tap water in Tokyo should not be given to the babies. For the adult, it's OK. But for just a precautious measure, he is telling people in Tokyo not to give tap water to the babies.
It was because raining yesterday and all the, I think the radioactive particle was washed away in the rain and I think came down. That's the scientists' explanation.
Monica Attard: Well, the government is certainly saying that there is no perceptible threat at this point in time from that radioactive iodine. Do you believe the government?
Taro Kono: Yes. The government has tried to ... well, has evacuated the people within a twenty kilometre radius of the nuclear power plant in Fukushima.
And the government has been assuring people living outside of a thirty kilometre radius not are harmed by these radioactive issues.
So I think we believe them.
Monica Attard: Now there are many people around the world who are questioning why the Japanese government chose to build nuclear reactors on a tectonic fault line.
Now, your party - the LDP - governed almost continuously for nearly 54 years from its founding in 1955 until its defeat in 2009.
What was the reasoning behind building nuclear reactors where they are susceptible to earthquakes?
Taro Kono: A lot of facts are found after the government or power companies had built reactors. So the government has changed their regulation for these earthquake issues, some years ago. And they were trying to retrofit so that they could pass the earthquake regulations.
I mean, actually this Fukushima first nuclear power plant withstood one of the strongest earthquakes that we have experienced. But I think the planning wasn't enough for this tsunami.
So the tsunami came after the earthquake and it washed away all the power supply to the reactor and the control rooms. And that's what caused this accident.
So, well, I think we should be very careful where to build a nuclear power plant. But when they actually planned this Fukushima thing, they didn't know a lot of facts that has been later discovered by the scientists.
And the nuclear power plant in Fukushima was strong enough. I think you could say that. But planning against a tsunami wasn't sufficient.
Monica Attard: And so what didn't they know that the scientists now know?
Taro Kono: There are a lot of fault line that wasn't really discovered when they were building their early nuclear power plant, so.
Monica Attard: Now, I mean, nuclear energy has been a national strategic priority for Japan since 1973, as I understand it.
What is it about nuclear energy which has the Japanese governments, current and past, so committed to it given the risks and given the earthquake probabilities which, as you say, they built in order to withstand; but given those probabilities, what is it about nuclear energy that so enthrals the Japanese government?
Taro Kono: Well, I mean, Japan import more than 99 per cent of the oil we need. So back in 1973 the government was trying to promote a nuclear power. That I understand.
But back in 1973, the government was telling us they would have, we would have a fast breeder reactor to burn plutonium by year 2000. And then we would solve all the energy problem in Japan for many years to come.
But in reality the fast breeder reactor is nowhere near to be seen. I mean, the government now officially announced the fast breeder reactor will not be ready at least - at least - by year 2050.
And we have now 45 tonnes of plutonium although we have no fast breeder reactor burn.
So originally the nuclear strategy was very logical. But in those thirty years a lot of vested interests and a lot of things came in strategy, and it's been skewed. I think we have now not so logical strategy and that has been operated on.
And the media - media has been receiving a lot of sponsorship from the power industry and the media never criticise the nuclear policy of Japan.
So we are all guilty as politicians, media, bureaucrats, power industry. And after this accident, I think we must seriously review our nuclear strategy to come.
Monica Attard: Yes, because, Taro, you've been quite critical publicly of the nexus between the companies which run these installations, and the regulators and the government.
Can I ask you, what evidence do you have that there is something going wrong in those relationships?
Taro Kono: Well, the politicians, the current opposition politicians, receiving a lot of political contributions from the nuclear or the power company or power industries.
Current government party are heavily backed by the power companies' union. And their ex-bureaucrats coming to Tokyo Power Company and other power companies and they sit on their management board.
So no-one can criticise each other. Even media just bought and paid for by the power industry. So no-one's seriously looking into it.
I've been criticising the nuclear strategy, but everyone thought I've been weird (laughs).
Monica Attard: And at the same time there's criticism that the companies which run the installations are very close to the government regulators.
Taro Kono: The government regulator, I mean, the top regulator is now sitting in TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) management board right after that. And people before that, you know, a lot of management of TEPCO came from ex-regulators.
And if you look at the seniority system in Japan, the regulator, I mean the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency or METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) cannot really criticise TEPCO because their senior people are sitting there. So this is very unholy triangle.
Monica Attard: So is the suspicion, then, that the regulators have in that sense been corrupted by the private companies which are running the reactors?
Taro Kono: In terms of the safety regulation, Japan has the most meticulous regulations and they've been applied. So I don't think the safety regulation has been corrupted.
But I mean the nuclear policy - the energy policy - was really, you could say, corrupted.
The power company has sort of a regional monopoly. And a lot of people have been the criticising the ministry or the government never tried to do something with this regional monopoly of the power companies.
Monica Attard: OK. Well, I'm Monica Attard. This is Sunday Profile.
And my guest today is Taro Kono, who is a member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and also sitting on the Japanese Disaster Relief Committee, which is overseeing the rehabilitation of vast areas of land after the earthquake, tsunami and, of course, the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
OK, well, let's talk a little bit about that strategy, because Japan is the third largest nuclear power user in the world. It has some 55 reactors providing 35 per cent of your country's energy needs.
Now even if the government were to re-think the nuclear energy strategy, it'd be enormously difficult, wouldn't it, to change course at this point?
Taro Kono: Well, it takes time. Uranium - we even have to import most of it. So unless we can build a fast breeder reactor to burn plutonium, I mean, the nuclear energy is almost as equal with the oil which we rely 99 per cent from outside.
And a lot of nuclear reactors are reaching the end of their life which is thirty years. I mean, Fukushima has extended ten years of the reactor life after that.
And it is very difficult to build a nuclear reactor, the new nuclear reactor, at this moment.
So we will have to start shutting down the reactors that came to the end of the life.
Where are we going to go? I think we would have to migrate to natural gas first. But eventually I think we need to promote a lot of renewable energy.
The ministry and the power industry have been suppressing promotion of renewable energy because that would be harmful to their nuclear interest.
But now people are seeing this. So I think that Japan would have to really seriously focussing promotion of the renewable energy.
Monica Attard: So one of the things, then, that you're talking about is replacing the amount of energy produced by decommissioned nuclear energy plants, with energy from plants producing liquefied natural gas. Is that right?
Taro Kono: Well, I think that would be the most cleanest and most realistic migration. And then we would have to have renewable energy taking over from the gas.
Monica Attard: And where would the liquefied natural gas come from?
Taro Kono: It would still come from the Middle East and Russia - Russian far east. So we need to secure those supplies from two regions.
Monica Attard: And presumably you need to secure your dispute with Russia over the Kuril Islands before you do any of that?
Taro Kono: That's right. Well, we have been moving forward with this gas project although we have northern island issues.
But I think it's really seriously, we have to sit down with Russian politicians to settle down how we're going to fix this northern island issue.
Monica Attard: How would you propose fixing it?
Taro Kono: We have to talk more realistic way. I mean all the time the government is saying, well, all those islands should come back to Japan. And we've been saying it for fifty years and none came back.
So I think we really have to seriously and realistically negotiate with Russians.
Monica Attard: Is it time to give them up?
Taro Kono: Two islands are promised to be back to Japan when we sign the peace treaty. So the two other islands - how we're going to do it - that's going to be the issue of the talk.
Monica Attard: Now back to this idea of the liquefied natural gas, though. I wonder ... that sounds to be a very, very expensive proposition to change the source of energy from nuclear reactors to liquefied natural gas. That will be an enormous cost on the country, won't it?
Taro Kono: Yes. We're going to decommission the nuclear reactors anyway. And if we close down those reactors then we have to look for any kind of ...
The government's original policy is to rebuild the nuclear reactor, I mean, which is more costly. So I think we're going to be looking at the cheaper alternative.
Monica Attard: Now you're on the record - in WikiLeaks cables, it has to be said - as having told US embassy officials that the government was instrumental in defeating legislation to support alternative energy development.
Is it your belief that the government is absolutely disinterested in alternative energy sources?
Taro Kono: In the past, the ministry deliberately trying to look the other way.
We had proposed a similar policy that Germany was introducing, that would have promoted renewable energy in Japan almost as much as Germany right now. But industry and the ministry took the other way.
Well, they said the RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standards) would promote renewable energy in Japan, but they have been proven to be very wrong.
Monica Attard: And you've also criticised the government's handling of subsidies to alternative energy suppliers, saying that those subsidies are so short-lived that the companies can't get investors on board.
Do you seriously think that in a country the size of Japan, and with such high energy needs, that alternative sources can actually fill the gap if nuclear sources were to disappear?
Taro Kono: Well, energy need is there. And if we decommission the nuclear reactors, I mean, energy has to come from somewhere.
We can burn oil. We can burn natural gas. Or we could introduce renewable energy. I mean, we have many choices.
But if we look at the climate change, I don't think it's feasible to build another oil, you know, that would emit a lot of carbons. So either we would introduce a more cleaner natural gas or we would try to promote renewable energy.
I mean we have many choices. But if we consider all the alternatives, everything would cost money. Everything costs. But if we look at the long run - what would be the most feasible alternative to the nuclear reactor - I say it's renewable.
Monica Attard: I mean, I do wonder though what the population thinks, because according to some polls that I've seen that have been published it seems only fifteen per cent of the population are opposed to nuclear energy.
I mean, why do you think that people don't mind the concept of nuclear energy?
Taro Kono: Oh, because media never criticise nuclear.
I mean, media has been bought and paid for by the power company. I mean, all the news program in Japan are sponsored by the, either power company or the association of the power companies. And they were never allowed to criticise the energy policy by those sponsor.
So I mean the people are not receiving all the information. It's very natural people respond to the poll in that way.
Now they opening up their eyes.
Monica Attard: So you think there will be a public debate now on the whole issue?
Taro Kono: Oh, I think so, yes.
Monica Attard: And how do you think that's going to unfold in the wake of Fukushima?
Taro Kono: I think the Japanese people would get more correct information. And I think the power company will be - should be - prohibited from being sponsor to the media so we could have a free debate on the energy policy.
Monica Attard: And if there is an open and free debate, do you think that renewable energy is an issue that you will campaign on in the next election?
Taro Kono: Well, I first have to convince my colleagues in the LDP. Certainly the promoting the renewable energy should be on the platform of my party.
Monica Attard: So your colleagues are still unconvinced?
Taro Kono: Well, they are now more, much more sceptical about nuclear energy.
I mean, a lot of politicians in the parliament cannot tell the difference between burning uranium and burning plutonium. They've been blindfolded and they just blindly follow their so-called national strategy.
And now they are actually looking at what's written in this national strategy and wondering why they have believed this for so many years.
So I think they are now opening up, and they are trying to gather more information outside of Tokyo Power Company and the ministry.
Monica Attard: Taro, there's been so much focus on the Fukushima issues and the disaster that appeared to be unfolding there last week. It seems the plight of the victims who actually survived the tsunami is moving out of the media spotlight. Is that a perception within Japan, as well?
Taro Kono: Not at all. It's only outside.
I mean no-one died from Fukushima incident. But a lot of people are still suffering, half a million people still dislocated.
When we talk about our issues, it's tsunami first and nuclear power plant second.
Monica Attard: Now you're a member of the Liberal Democratic Party's counter disaster relief committee. How, in your view, is the government going to house these people who've been left homeless?
Taro Kono: Well, I think we now need to come up with strategy. I don't think it's feasible to build houses back to the original places.
I mean, this is certainly very different situation from what happened in Kobe. Kobe is a big city. You know, the concentration is pretty high and it's easy to get access to.
But this tsunami, this location is in wide areas. And they have experienced tsunami. This is, for some people this is the second time in their life.
So we need to come up with strategy, how we're going to rebuild those cities and towns and how we're going to reconstruct Tohoku area where the tsunami hit.
And we need to debate basic concept of rehabilitation policy.
Monica Attard: And so do you think they should be relocated inland?
Taro Kono: Some people need to be relocated. Some villages might be possibly abandoned and people need to be moving closer to the cities. Some village have a very many old people and the young people already left for the big cities. So we might have to debate hard choices.
Monica Attard: And, of course, the hard choices will come as well with those fishing villages which have been decimated. Presumably they can't be relocated inland otherwise they won't be fishing villages, will they?
Taro Kono: Oh yeah, yeah. How we're going to do this fishing industry is another issue.
I mean, a lot of fishermen have small fishing boats compared to the other countries. How we're going to rehabilitate the fishing industry is also another hard choices.
Monica Attard: And I guess the particularly hard choice there is how to relocate them if that's what you need to do and keep a viable fishing industry going.
Taro Kono: That's right. That's right.
Monica Attard: And how do you do that? Have you turned your mind to that?
Taro Kono: Well Japan has been, sort of the government has been investing into a lot of small fishing ports. It's probably time to sort of consolidate those small investment to bigger ones. And the small fishing boat need to be consolidated to more modern, larger ships.
So we have a lot of hard choices to come.
Monica Attard: And the impact? What do you think the impact will be of this disaster on the fishing industry in Japan generally speaking, from a financial perspective?
Taro Kono: We have to calculate how much investment and how much loans and how much money will be necessary to come back with their industry.
I don't, I hope the government has started those calculations. I haven't seen the numbers yet. But it's going to have a big impact.
Monica Attard: The Fukushima disaster is already impacting exports of foods from Japan. I imagine it will be years before confidence is returned.
Taro Kono: I think the first thing the government has to do is to make timely announcements. I think the government and the TEPCO have been very late in announcing all those facts and information. And that's the first thing we need to fix.
Whatever number, if the number is high or low, the government has to timely announce it. And that's the first step. And we are not able to take that first step yet.
Monica Attard: But regardless of when the government makes announcements, the impact of this disaster on Japan's ability to economically emerge from the crisis - the disaster I'm talking about there of course is Fukushima - but the addition of Fukushima on top of an earthquake and a tsunami will have an enormous impact on Japan's ability to economically emerge from the crisis, won't it?
Taro Kono: Uh hmm. Well, we came back from the World War II so I'm not worried about that. I mean, it will take time, but it will come back, don't worry about us.
Monica Attard: And that was Japanese MP and Liberal Democratic Party member, Taro Kono, who is also on his party's counter disaster relief committee, speaking to me from Japan.
And that's Sunday Profile this week. Thank you very much for your company.
Thanks also to producer, Belinda Sommer.

BRISBANE, March 27 AAP - Protesters say they'll form a human barricade to stop a coal seam gas pipeline being built through their rural residential estate on Queensland's western downs.
 Friends of the Earth says Queensland Gas Company (QGC) is due to start building the 16km pipeline through the Tara estate, south of Chinchilla.
The pipeline will take coal seam gas from five wells already in the estate to the nearby Kenya gas processing plant.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton says the increased presence of police and gas workers near where the pipeline will be built indicates that work is about to start.
 Everything is pointing at action starting up this week,  Mr Hutton told AAP.
 We will be starting the blockade from Monday. 
The protesters, who started arriving on Saturday night, will form a human barricade to stop work on the pipeline when it reaches the boundary of QGC-controlled land.
Hundreds have registered to take part including people from interstate.
 They know that this will be their fight in the not too distant future, they are seeing Tara very much as the front line in a war with this very destructive industry. 
Protesters are concerned about the effect the project will have on their health, the environment, including groundwater stores, and land values.
Event co-organiser and local Michael Bretherick said they have to take matters into their own hands because the state and federal governments aren't prioritising the interests of locals.
He said not all landholders have agreed to the pipeline and there were fears the growing industry on the estate would affect all, not just those with the pipeline.
 We have a deficient government and therefore we are taking on the responsibility of looking after our interests,  he told AAP.
QGC spokesman Rob Millhouse would not confirm when workers would enter the estate.
 If I knew I wouldn't tell you, primarily because of the circumstances we're in,  he said.
 We don't think that this is the way to resolve anything.
 We will mobilise equipment when we believe is necessary. 
The company said nearly half of the proposed work will be done on land it owns and the 14 landholders directly affected by the work had agreed to compensation packages for disturbance to their land.
Police said they were well prepared for the influx of people who had come to Tara and Chinchilla for the protest.
A spokeswoman confirmed extra police had been brought in.
 The area will be policed using district resources along with the assistance from specialist trained officers. 
A blockade was organised by protesters a fortnight ago to raise awareness of the issue.

BRISBANE, March 28 AAP - Protesters have disrupted construction of a coal seam gas pipeline on a rural residential property on Queensland's Western Downs with one activist chaining herself to a bulldozer.
 The afternoon disruption was the second on Monday.
Protesters formed a human barricade at the Tara Estate, south of Chinchilla, on Monday morning to stop Queensland Gas Company building a 16km pipeline to take coal seam gas from five wells on the estate to the nearby Kenya gas processing plant.
The Friends of the Earth activist group said member Cassie McMahon locked herself to a bulldozer that was knocking down bush along the route of the pipeline.
 Police moved in on the 25 protesters who finally dispersed after stopping work for more than two hours,  group spokesman Drew Hutton said.
 About 40 police are involved in the operation assisting BG Group to enter the estate. 
QGC briefly resumed its work in the afternoon before protesters disrupted their efforts for a second time.
Tara landholder Michael Bretherick told AAP police were  scratching their heads  because the protesters had permission to be on the private property where the pipeline is being built.
 We just went in there,  he said.
 Although the gas company keeps the gates locked they have no right to lock the gates because they have locked the owner out of his own property.
 The gates are wide open and a couple of police are there taking vehicle numbers as we come and go.
 The protesters are sitting there, right where they want to put the pipeline. 
He said Ms McMahon was not arrested in the end.
 There's more police there than protesters, it's overkill,  he said.
Mr Bretherick said the protesters were camping on the property overnight.
A QGC spokesman said the company had all relevant approvals under Queensland legislation.
QGC said nearly half of the proposed work would be done on land it owned and the 14 landholders directly affected by the work had agreed to compensation packages for disturbance of their land.
Protesters say they are deeply concerned about the effects the project will have on their health, the environment, including groundwater stores, and land values.
They also fear the growing gas industry on the estate will affect all properties, not just those where the pipeline is located.
The protest is expected to continue for days.
Mr Hutton said the day's activities were simply part of the overall blockade.
 This blockade was set up because residents on the Tara estate told BG Group they had locked the gate to their community,  he said.
 In the face of this community rejection a multinational mining giant has used the Queensland police to bulldoze its way onto the properties of Aussie battlers in order to impose a gasfield on them. 
Soon-to-be state opposition leader Campbell Newman said there needed to be a more harmonious relationship between the companies and the local communities.
 If we could come up with some protocols, hopefully protocols rather than having to legislate, and get better working relationships, I know that Queensland can get the benefits of this industry, and we can continue to see good cropping land being used,  he told reporters in Brisbane.
 I think that there are a number of things that these large companies could be doing and should be doing to actually soften some of the impacts out there.

ABCNEW,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News,2011,1,"The Queensland Greens say the coal seam gas (CSG) industry will be the focus of their next state election campaign.
There has been speculation Premier Anna Bligh will call an early poll after last week's Liberal National Party (LNP) leadership shake-up.
 Greens spokeswoman Libby Connors says CSG mining is at the top of the Greens environmental concerns for the state.
 While the whole country is caught up with how we should respond to climate change, we're just getting this extraordinarily contradictory behaviour coming from the state of Queensland,  she said.
 There have been calculations that Queensland will be one of the biggest exporters of fossil fuels. 
Ms Connors says both the State Government and the Opposition have no desire to stop the industry's rapid expansion.
 It just looks like we're going to have both major parties in this state with uncritical and uncomfortably close relationships with this very powerful industry,  she said.

COUMAI,The Courier-Mail,2011,1,"QUEENSLAND'S liquefied natural gas industry has begun its multi-billion-dollar investments with markets in Asia looking robust enough to give it a solid head start.
But there is plenty of ``unconventional gas'' (coal seam gas and shale gas) locked in huge coal and shale basins across the region, in China and India in particular.
 The unlocking of large shale gas reserves in the US in the past few years has seen the US go from a potentially large gas importer to a potential exporter.
And down the track, though probably not until next decade at least, there is likely to be plenty of competition to Queensland suppliers of LNG from Asian domestic gas and exports from elsewhere.
Demand, will - on present trends - also be a lot higher.
And Japan's nuclear disaster is likely to increase demand even faster than might otherwise have been.
But export LNG prices, which are the current holy grail of Queensland's LNG hopefuls - BG Group's QGC, Santos and partners, Origin Energy and Conoco Phillips and Shell and PetroChina - may not then provide the premiums available at present.
LNG prices in Asia are currently generally oil linked, to what is known as the Japan Crude Cocktail.
But the rise of shale gas production in the US has decoupled gas from oil - and gas prices have slumped from a record $US13.69 per million British thermal units in 2008 to about $US4.00 now.
Queensland Gas Commissioner Kaye Gardiner canvassed some of these issues as among the ``wildcards'' the coal seam gas to LNG industry would likely face in the next decade or so, in a Queensland 2011 Gas Market Review presentation to the FutureGas2011 conference in Brisbane last week.
Noting recent ``significant technical improvements in drilling and gas recovery'' Ms Gardiner said ``world unconventional gas resources (which include CSG and shale) were estimated at a massive 35.8 million petajoules'' and could be a lot more.
In 2009, Australian CSG reserves were about 36,000PJ, though reserves are currently being added at about 9000PJ a year as drilling to supply planned LNG plants, on top of the domestic market, gears up.
``The US has moved from being a net gas importer to a potential gas exporter with shale gas production there having already reshaped the international movement of LNG,'' Ms Gardiner said.
And unconventional gas ``could continue to shift the supply map''.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"New technology and higher LNG prices mean fields found 40 years ago may now be developed, writes Angela Macdonald-Smith.
With all forecasts pointing to a sustained pick-up in liquefied natural gas demand in Japan on the back of its nuclear power crisis, things are looking up for Australia's estimated $1 trillion worth of gas held in marginal deposits.
 The government puts estimates of so-called stranded gas â€“ fields considered too small or distant to be profitably developed â€“ at up to 140 trillion cubic feet (tcf), more than a third of the total.
But progress in technologies such as floating LNG (FLNG), together with higher oil prices and rising Asian gas demand should give a leg-up to efforts to develop those deposits, some of which have lain fallow for decades.
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson's toughening-up of the  use it or lose it  stance on licences for undeveloped fields should also ensure quicker commercialisation of deposits when an economic case can be made.
 The days when companies can sit on a gas resource without really making a concerted effort to examine all options to monetise it are rapidly drawing to a close,  said Jurgen Hendrich, managing director of MEO Australia, which wants to develop methanol and LNG projects tapping undeveloped deposits in the Timor Sea.
Royal Dutch Shell is due within months to give the go-ahead for what could be the world's first venture to produce LNG from a floating ship, paving the way for the development of other smaller gas deposits far from shore.
The Prelude project in the Browse Basin, costing up to $10 billion, will tap about 3 tcf of gas resources within Shell's Prelude and Concerto fields.
The volume of gas â€“ much smaller than, for example, the 40-plus tcf of gas underpinning Chevron's Gorgon LNG venture â€“ and the fields' location more than 200 kilometres from the West Australian coast mean the deposits would otherwise lie undeveloped.
In a recent briefing, Shell chief financial offer Simon Henry was enthusiastic about the prospects for proceeding with Prelude this year, with the Sunrise field in the Timor Sea earmarked as the next candidate for FLNG.
He described the technology as  a great strategic tool to have in the toolbox for relatively small discoveries a long way from shore that are difficult to bring into a bigger scheme .
Shell is considering other potential FLNG projects in Australia, Indonesia, elsewhere in Asia and off sub-Saharan Africa.
Australia's northern waters alone could host as many as seven FLNG projects in production or development within 10 years, according to Northern Territory Resources Minister Kon Vatskalis.
Santos has linked with France's GDF Suez for a FLNG project at the Petrel and Tern fields in the Bonaparte Basin, off Darwin, in an effort to drive commercialisation of gas found as long ago as 1969. But a solution has yet to be found for the nearby Caldita and Barossa fields held by Santos and ConocoPhillips.
Thailand's PTTEP, Inpex and Oslo-listed Flex LNG have all proposed FLNG plants in waters off Australia in the past two years as the technology has advanced.
Technological progress also opened up Queensland's vast coal-seam gas fields for development at deposits that were considered stranded back in the 1990s.
But technology is just one factor that helps transform stranded gas into a commercial development to meet either export or domestic demand.
 It's a question of price and the overall supply-demand balance situation,  Graeme Bethune, chief executive of Adelaide-based energy economics EnergyQuest, said.
Off the south-east coast, the Kipper field, found in 1986, was for decades considered uncommercial but is now under development.
Off Western Australia, development of BHP Billiton's Macedon and Apache's Reindeer deposits only began more than 10 years after their discovery, prompted by higher prices and rising domestic demand. Woodside's Browse LNG project, set for a mid-2012 go-ahead, will tap fields found as long as 40 years ago.
Australia's biggest gas field still to be lacking a development plan is the 8 tcf Scarborough field found 30 years ago, 300 kilometres off the West Australian coast. Owners ExxonMobil and BHP have rejected the floating option and are nearing a decision on an onshore plan.
But domestic gas and LNG were not the only options for stranded gas, said MEO's Mr Hendrich, who believes methanol offers an attractive alternative for fields in the Timor Sea that hold gas with a higher concentration of carbon dioxide.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Queensland's state water corporation, SunWater, is set to benefit from coal seam gas development in southern Queensland through the sale of treated underground water to local farmers.
Under arrangements that are in final negotiations, SunWater will be given hundreds of megalitres of water that come from the extraction of gas in QGC's mines near Chinchilla and Miles.
 QGC, which is owned by Britain's BG Group, will send the water from the wells to processing plants being constructed now at a cost of more than $10 million by British-based construction giant Laing O'Rourke.
The water will then travel along a 20-kilometre pipeline to the Condamine River.
SunWater will provide the pipeline infrastructure enabling it to inject the flows back into the river system and sell the water on to farmers.
About 40 per cent of the revenue from the sale of water is expected to go back to QGC, which will then pass that back to SunWater to cover the cost of infrastructure.
QGC will be pumping anywhere between 12 megalitres and 49 megalitres of water per day from its wells with a peak of up to 90 megalitres a day when it fulfils its goal of about 6000 wells by 2014.
The average price being offered for a megalitre of water in the lower Balonne River, downstream from the Condamine, is $1433. If the water being used by SunÂ­Water in the Condamine could fetch even half that, it could extract up to $25 million in water value from the gas wells.
Permits and approvals for the development are expected to be signed by the end of this month. Construction of the project, named the Kenya to Chinchilla Pipeline, will start in April.
The Kenya-Chinchilla project is a mere fraction of the size of SunWater's other major pipeline projects that are now in the pre-construction phase, the Connors River Dam and Pipeline and the Galilee Basin Pipeline.
The 373,600-megalitre dam and 368 kilometres of pipelines will provide up to 49,500 megalitres of additional water security for the Bowen and Galilee basins.
KEY POINTS SunWater will be given hundreds of megalitres of water that comes from the extraction of gas. It will provide pipeline infrastructure to enable it to inject the water back into rivers and onsell it to farmers.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Nuclear power is out of favour, at least in the short-term, but Australia's liquified natural gas industry is unlikely to benefit any time soon.
According to Deutsche Bank, if 40 per cent of Japan's offline nuclear power requirements were met using LNG imports, an additional 4.5 million metric tonnes per year of gas would be required. Much of this will come from redirecting Qatari cargoes currently sold into Europe, not the North West Shelf which sells its estimated two mmtpa of spare gas into the spot market to feed Asian demand. Longer-term, producers like Woodside and Santos will have the biggest upside as they should have capacity to increase LNG production beyond current contract positions.
 Santos is also the only Australian producer with exposure to Darwin LNG, which supplies under contracts to Tokyo Electric and Tokyo Gas.
Following the 2007 Niigata Chuetsu earthquake, Japan favoured oil-fired power, however, gas imports at a better comparative rate to oil than it did then: $US10/mmbtu for gas and $US18/mmbtu for oil.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"A FEMALE protester chained herself to a bulldozer and police were forced to call for reinforcements as the blockade of a
coal-seam gas project on Queensland's Western Downs intensified yesterday.
 Protesters began arriving on Saturday night ahead of the blockade of the Tara Estate, south of Chinchilla, in a bid to stop the construction of a 16km pipeline to carry gas from five existing wells to the nearby Kenya processing plant.
Most of the Queensland Gas Company pipeline will run through properties owned by 14 landholders; they have each agreed to the construction and will receive compensation for the use of their land.
But protest spokesman Michael Bretherick said the activists were concerned the project would affect surrounding properties and not just those in the way of the pipeline: ``We have a deficient government and we are taking on the responsibility of looking after our interests.''
Mr Bretherick said a female protester had chained herself to a bulldozer at the edge of the estate, temporarily stopping work.
QGC spokesman Rob Millhouse yesterday said the workers would resume construction when they were able. ``We don't think this is the way to resolve anything,'' he said.
Police confirmed they had called for extra officers as the protest continued, but there had not been any serious incidents.
Mr Bretherick said there were at least 20 to 30 police monitoring the protest. ``It's overkill,'' he said.
Friends of the Earth spokesman Drew Hutton said hundreds had registered to continue the protest. ``They know that this will be their fight in the not too distant future. They are seeing Tara very much as the front line in a war with this destructive industry.''
QGC said the area already has well-developed gas infrastructure, including the Roma-to-Brisbane pipeline, which supplies gas to southeast Queensland, and the Braemar pipeline, which supplies gas to the Braemar power station on the Darling Downs. QGC, Australian subsidiary of the British BG Group, has promised to rehabilitate damaged land.

AAP,Australian Associated Press General News,2011,1,"CSG BRISBANE, March 29 AAP - An environmental activist has been arrested at a human blockade protesting against the construction of a coal seam gas pipeline on Queensland's Western Downs.
Friends of the Earth campaigner Drew Hutton was arrested at 2.20pm (AEST) on Tuesday at the Tara Estate, south of Chinchilla.
 Police charged him under Section 804 of the Petroleum and Gas Act with obstruction of a petroleum authority holder, an offence that carries a potential $50,000 fine.
The section guarantees mining and gas companies access to private land.
The protest is part of a month-long campaign by local farmers and environmentalists to stop Queensland Gas Company building a 16km pipeline to take coal seam gas from five wells on the estate to the nearby Kenya gas processing plant.
Friends of the Earth spokeswoman Cassie McMahon told AAP that Mr Hutton has refused police bail conditions not return to the property or nearby public roads.
 He's been told he could be in custody at the Toowoomba Watchhouse for 30 days,  she said.
She said police had demanded the protesters leave the property, despite having the landowner's permission to be there.
 Drew sat down on the ground as the bulldozer was approaching,  she said.
QGC says it has all relevant approvals under Queensland legislation.
The company said nearly half of the proposed work would be done on land it owned and the 14 landholders directly affected by the work had agreed to compensation packages for disturbance of their land.
Protesters say they are deeply concerned about the effects the project will have on their health, the environment including groundwater, and land values.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"The Gillard government is moving to put its own stamp on the Reserve Bank of Australia board with Â­speculation that Treasurer Wayne Swan will appoint two new members today, including a former key Labor adviser.
The two names that have been raised are former HSBC chief economist â€“ and former economics adviser to Paul Keating â€“ John Edwards and the managing director of natural gas company BG Group, Catherine Tanna.
 Federal cabinet met in a marathon session yesterday and is believed to have signed off on the appointment of two new members who would bring resources industry experience and an economics background to the board.
This follows the departure of former National Farmers Federation president and Telstra chairman Â­Donald McGauchie and academic economist Warwick McKibbin.
Neither Professor McKibbin nor Mr McGauchie were seeking appointment for a third five-year term. Professor McKibbin had become a controversial figure, regularly challenging government policy stances.
Mr Swan has in the past publicly expressed his desire to balance stability with fresh thinking on the central bank board and, as a result, has reÂ­appointed Jillian Broadbent and Roger Corbett, who is chairman of Fairfax Media, publisher of T he Australian Financial Review.
If appointed, Ms Tanna would attend her first board meeting next week while Dr Edwards â€“ who has been working overseas for the past few years â€“ would not join the board until July.
An appointment of a board member with extensive resources sector experience would come at a crucial time in the economic debate about Australia's two-speed economy.
The impact of the resources sector on the economy is one of the most hotly debated policy dilemmas facing the RBA and the government
However, the appointment of Dr Edwards, if confirmed, could attract controversy because of his close association with Labor in the past.
It also follows the announcement over the weekend that Mr Swan's former chief of staff, Chris Barrett, has been appointed Australia's ambassador to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.
Ms Tanna joined BG Group in March 2009 after a long career in Shell in Asia, Africa and the United Kingdom, where she had extensive LNG, gas transmission and power distribution experience. Before Shell, she worked with BHP Petroleum.
Dr Edwards is currently executive director for economic planning and development for the Economic Development Board of the Kingdom of Bahrain.
While Dr Edwards, a former journalist, has also held several other academic and bureaucratic positions, he is best known to many as an economic adviser to the former treasurer and prime minister Paul Keating, and as the author of a biography of the former Labor leader.
He spent 12 years, from 1997 to 2009, as chief economist for Australia and New Zealand at global financial group HSBC, advising the group and its clients on the economic outlook, the direction of exchange rates and interest rates, and on a range of economic policy issues.
He holds a PhD and Master of Philosophy in economics from George Washington University and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney. For his doctorate, he created and tested a model of the Australian monetary policy mechanism to examine the impact of financial deregulation on monetary policy.
In 2008, Dr Edwards was given leave of absence from HSBC to accept a secondment to the Australian Treasury as chief adviser on financial markets where he worked on policy aspects of the global impact of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis.
From 1994 to 1996 he was appointed by the Department of Foreign Affairs as adviser to the Australian member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Eminent Persons Group and to the two Australian members of the APEC Business Â­Advisory Council.
He has also been a visiting scholar in the economic history unit at the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University.

AFNR,The Australian Financial Review,2011,1,"Rumblings about the options for Royal Dutch Shell's remaining 24 per cent of Woodside Petroleum, which are keeping Woodside shares at 11-month highs, have focused alternately on BHP Billiton or Japanese trading houses Mitsui and Mitsubishi taking up the $8 billion stake.
But the latest word from the Woodside camp, now including both long-term advisers Credit Suisse and Grant Samuel, points to a potential deal with BHP, despite its doubts about Woodside's market valuation. Also still gaining attention is Merrill Lynch's theory of a potential asset-for-shares swap between Woodside and Shell, which would include Shell lifting its share in the controversial Browse liquefied natural gas venture.
 This talk has spurred optimism about the momentum behind gas in the Browse Basin, which would boost views on the value of other assets such as Nexus Energy's Echuca Shoals and Crux fields.
The troubled Crux venture has its own problems, with minority partner Osaka Gas unconvinced about Nexus's costly deal with Shell for a three-year extension to 2023 before the rights to gas at the field pass to the oil giant.
Nexus has flagged it could buy Osaka Gas's 10 per cent stake if joint-venture approval isn't forthcoming while admitting a co-ordinated gas-condensates venture with Shell would be the best outcome if government approvals could be secured.
Not that this means Shell itself need make a move on Nexus, despite persistent speculation of a potential bid.
The view in some quarters is that what happens at the Browse LNG venture will not affect outcomes at Crux, even though Shell wants to tap the gas at the field for its Prelude floating LNG project, which is set for a go-ahead within months.
After all, Shell has been free for years to buy Nexus and put its long-suffering shareholders out of their misery but has chosen instead to wait it out.

AUSTLN,The Australian,2011,1,"CHINA is likely to cut its nuclear power generation targets by about 10 per cent by 2020 and stop approvals for any new inland reactors in the aftermath of the disaster at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant.
This could mean China will increase its coal usage and carbon emissions or expand its plans for use of clean technologies such as wind and solar, or the lower-emission fuel, natural gas.
 Two weeks ago the Chinese government put on hold the country's $150 billion nuclear program -- it had 27 reactors under construction -- as it boosted safety inspections on its nuclear industry.
China Electricity Council deputy director Wei Shaofeng this week told a conference on China's electricity industry outlook that Japan's nuclear crisis at Fukushima plant created a groundswell of concern in the global nuclear power sector and that China would pull back its ambitions.
China has six nuclear plants in operation and is building 27 of the 62 plants under construction worldwide. China has longer-term plans to have 100 reactors. But Mr Wei said this could be cut back, adding that China's current plans were to build reactors in coastal areas. While some inland cities -- notably Chongqing -- plan their own reactors, it is unlikely that inland nuclear facilities will be approved, according to the Caixin website. Chongqing is only 200km from the area in Sichuan where the 2008 earthquake killed more than 90,000 people.
China has unveiled plans to spend 5 trillion yuan ($742bn) on new energy projects in the next decade, with nuclear accounting for 24 per cent of the total.
China's plan to slow its nuclear rollout came as it unveiled plans to cut energy use and carbon emissions per unit of industrial value-added output by 4 per cent this year from last year's levels.
Authorities said yesterday that trace amounts of atmospheric radiation from Japan's stricken plant had been detected in more parts of China.

A farmer who ran as an independent candidate on a no mining and no coal seam gas exploration platform drew 21 per cent of the vote in the Upper Hunter electorate of the National's George Souris at the state election.
 And the incoming Coalition government should take note, the Hunter Environment Lobby warns.
Group spokeswoman Jan Davis said the election result, combined with a forum on the NSW Coal and Gas Strategy and Scoping Paper held earlier this month that attracted 500 people, sent a clear message about this issue's importance.
The group has criticised the strategy and scoping paper as out of date, lacking data and supportive of more unregulated mining.
But the group was also concerned about the lack of detail available about the Coalition's land use policy.
 The over-20 per cent vote on the weekend for the independent Tim Duddy on a no mining and no coal seam gas exploration ticket must attract the attention of the new government,  Ms Davis said.
 We expect that the Coalition government in NSW make this issue a priority and address the community concerns on the effects of mining on communities.
 The Liberal and National parties have developed a land use policy which would address many of the concerns of the group.
 However, no detail has been provided by the NSW opposition parties as to how the policy can be implemented in practice [now they are in government]. 
Ms Davis was hopeful the new government would change the strategy and scoping study to reflect the Hunter Environment Lobby's submission, which included a recommendation that the terms of reference be rewritten to support a transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable land use.
The document is open for public comment.
 The NSW Coal and Gas Strategy and Scoping Paper failed to take into account key issues such as environmental monitoring and human health,  Ms Davis said.
 It describes as 'emerging community concerns' a range of important environmental impacts that have been central issues of concern for decades.

The Toowoomba protests coincided with the Community Cabinet meeting and many there were mainly concerned about open-cut coal, while lifestyle impact was probably the main driver for the Kenya protests.
Common to all these events was Greens campaigner Drew Hutton who helped drive TV, radio and print media coverage against the CSG industry, underpinned by social media.
The slant embraced farmers; showed great sorghum crops on black soil plains somehow con-nected with Tara residential estate country; applauded a 70-year-old grandmother for being arrested; misrepresented the industry practice of hydraulic fracturing; made unsubstantiated and often non-sensical claims about either the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing or heavy metals and other things which mystically appear during the physical process of creating small passageways through sections of a coal seam (the process known as fracturing); ignored the engineering capability of gas well design and construction and consequential aquifer integrity. and; generally went on about CSG production poisoning soils, aquifers and rivers, and leaving farmers without water.
The twittering was extensive, picking up on sentiments without regard to accuracy or relevance and to the followers it is so much more believable because the words are on screen.
As I've said before, the CSG industry is comfortable with media scrutiny of production, landholder access, compensation and its environmental performance against some 1500 state and federal environmental requirements. The CSG industry is also comfortable with legitimate analysis against the myriad of claims made in propaganda campaigns and the 'I would just like to know' type query from the more rational end of debate.
But there was very little from the Greens in the way of legitimate analysis and probably even less in the way of desire to do so.
There was nothing about gas having half the greenhouse gas impact of coal in electricity generation; nothing about how we address rising energy demand while cutting greenhouse impact; nothing about how natural gas perfectly complements intermittent wind and solar or how renewable technology will expand to replace our dependence on fossil fuel for base load; nothing about money, jobs and services the CSG industry is putting into the bush.
By my reckoning, looking at how hard they run misinformation campaigns and how little impact they made on mainstream politics, I would say the average person is a lot smarter when voting than these misinformation campaigners gave them credit for. None of this changes the way in which the coal seam gas industry goes about its business.
We want to produce gas, to coexist with landholders, have good environmental credentials and be as much part of the community as the next person.
- this requires transparency, diligence, persistence and good government regulation and the CSG industry is committed to abiding by this formula for success.
